abstract: "The primary aim of this study is to establish whether, in rural Zambia, a wife saving in secret from her husband is more socially acceptable and less likely to be viewed as justifiable grounds for her being beaten by her husband if (1) the source of the money being saved is known to be her business and (2) the money is being saved into an account that is explicitly linked to her business. To investigate these issues, we will conduct a survey experiment involving 180 participants, 90 females, 90 males, who are members of savings groups in Luapula Province, Zambia.
To isolate specific ceteris paribus effects and provide context for our findings, we will also investigate the social acceptability of husbands saving in secret from their wives under the same set of scenarios and both wives and husbands saving and telling their spouses about the savings under the same set of scenarios.
