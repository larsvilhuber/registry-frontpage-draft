abstract: "We will implement a randomized controlled trial across all municipalities in Colombia to test whether different types of nudges received by the municipal tax authorities can incentivize the employment of land use revenue instruments at the local level. The country's over 1,100 municipalities were randomly divided into four groups after stratifying in terms of a number of variables associated with the municipal performance associated with the implementation of land use revenue instruments. Three such groups will receive different nudges in the form of an official letter sent by the National Planning Department (NPD) and addressed to the municipal mayor. The fourth is the control group and will receive no letter. The nudge of the first treatment group consist in comparing the recent performance of the municipality in terms of revenues associated with land use instruments with that of the department average. The nudge of the second treatment group appeals to the pro-sociality of tax authorities by highlighting how additional revenues can be used to improve the well-being of the most disadvantaged groups of the municipality. The nudge of the third treatment group emphasizes that future performance in terms of the implementation of land use revenue instruments will be monitored and made public by NPD. The same treatment will be sent to the outgoing and as well as the coming municipal administration, in July 2019 and January 2020 respectively. We will measure both medium-term outcomes related to the efforts made in implementing land use revenue instruments and long-term outcomes in terms of actual fiscal performance. The former requires an on-line survey which municipal tax authorities should respond. The latter will be done using administrative data on tax revenues."
