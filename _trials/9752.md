abstract: "In 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) set eye health as a priority by creating the “Universal Eye Health: A Global Action Plan 2014-2019.” The WHO’s reasoning is intuitive; poor visual health can impair quality of life in a number of ways- by limiting physical activity, causing emotional health problems, damaging work performance. In India, 55 million people suffer from presbyopia (the degeneration of sight related to age). Apart from the large-scale negative impact on quality of life, untreated visual impairments including presbyopia, are estimated to cost the Indian economy $37 billion in productivity losses annually. 

This study is an extension of a previous trial, which aimed to measure adherence to eye glasses and willingness to pay of the presbyopic sewing operators with glasses either free of cost or upon the payment of a nominal amount and consequently complying to regular wear of glasses for personal and firm’s benefits. We found out that providing glasses for free or at a nominal cost did not equate to adherence to glasses wear as we found less than 2% of the workers wearing glasses at the endline survey . We then conducted a short one month non-randomized pilot on 253 workers, where we introduced an element of incentivising monitoring and encouragement of glasses wear through supervsiors to improve adherence rates where we found that adherence to glasses wear among the workers increased to 47% in the first two weeks and further increased to 77% by the end the pilot (after four weeks).

To further explore the validity and scalability of the incentive based monitoring through supervisors for glasses wear adherence encouragement, we now propose conducting a clustered randomised controlled trial on a sample of the same 229 workers, where we randomly assign 25 (out of 50) supervisors to receive incentives based on tasks related to monitoring, assisting and encouraging workers with presbyopia to wear and get accustomed to the glasses. Each supervisor will be responsible for a group of 4-6 workers. The trial takes the form of a clustered randomised controlled trial with randomisation at the supervisor level (clusters).

We hypothesize that providing supervisor-led monitoring and assistance to glasses wear to workers with presbyopia will improve the usability and adherence to eyeglasses, increase their perceived and actual productivity, and ultimately contribute to their wellbeing.
