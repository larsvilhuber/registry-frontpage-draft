abstract: "Recent surveys show that about 25 to 42 percent of Germans do not intend to vaccinate against Covid-19. However, ensuring high uptake rates is crucial for achieving herd immunity. One reason why vaccination readiness may be low is due to low trust in the vaccine. In a randomized vignette study, we investigate how the duration and type of the vaccine admission process affects trust in the vaccine, and intentions to get vaccinated. "
