abstract: "The intervention being evaluated is the Amoye Digital Microcredit Initiative for Women Empowerment, in collaboration with a microfinance provider; Amoye Microfinance Bank, Ikere Ekiti Nigeria. The intervention offers microcredit alone and microcredit combined with digital banking services to clients. The key objective of study is to assess the effectiveness of the interventions, paying particularly attention to whether microcredit combined with digital banking services offers incremental impacts over what the demand side alone (microcredit) would have offered. The main identification strategy is a randomized control trial, involving random allocation of eligible beneficiaries into two treatments: microcredit only, microcredit + digital financial services, and a control group. The experimental design to examine spillover effects follows a clustered Randomized Saturation design. At least 75 clusters per block are required to generate sufficient power (min 0.80) and effect size (0.20) to examine the main research questions, leading to a total of 375 clusters. Findings will provide evidence informing Nigeriaâ€™s national financial inclusion and gender empowerment policy."
