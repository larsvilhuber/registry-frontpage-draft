abstract: "Can higher savings be generated using behavioral economics insights regarding procrastination? With five U.S. universities and a large national record keeper, we will randomize mailings sent to university employees encouraging increased retirement savings. Mailings will allow employees to increase savings by completing a simple form. We will randomly assign eligible employees to receive one of several different mailings. Some recipients will be encouraged to increase savings immediately. Others will be able to choose whether to increase savings immediately or at a time delay (e.g., “in three months”). A third group will receive mailings identical to those in the second group, except the time delay option will correspond to increasing savings on a meaningful future date (e.g., “on your next birthday”). This experiment will test whether an option to enroll “later” increases savings by leveraging individuals’ tendency to prefer putting off virtuous behaviors, as well as whether a salient “later” date can be particularly motivating."
