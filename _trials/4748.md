abstract: "The program uses football to introduce key issues around inclusion and has a goal to increase participants’ self-awareness and awareness of others, social skills and their sense of belonging and self-worth. Students participate in football training sessions and each time they learn a group of three keywords reflecting social skills needed to inspire inclusion, such as teamwork, communication, and respect. At the end of each training session, students get to reflect/ debrief on these words. The objective of the study is to assess whether adding puzzle retrieval practice to the usual debrief, can facilitate learning and improve students’ recall of the keywords, compared to the usual keyword debrief used in the program."
