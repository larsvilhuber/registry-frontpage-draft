abstract: "This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the effects of mentoring on SMEs in Norway. We aim to get a better understanding of firm development and dynamics in the presence of public interventions. Does mentoring affect firm performance and firm-survival? Does it matter what type of state aid a firm is granted; mentoring versus the financial equivalent of the service?
The trial is a three-armed parallel randomized control trial. The first group will receive mentoring; the second group will receive the financial equivalent to the cost of the mentoring, and the third group is a control. The population consists of small and medium-sized enterprises who have applied for and been granted financial support from Innovation Norway. From this population, we draw the three groups. All firms that are part of the trial are established 5 or fewer years ago. The total sample size will be 300 firms.
Exploiting a rich data set based on a set of matched register data, we will be analyzing both firm performance and external effects using a wide set of outcomes and measures. We will have information both about the firms and the people connected to the firms by employment, ownership or board members. We will assess outcomes twice after the intervention to study both short-term results and long-term results.
