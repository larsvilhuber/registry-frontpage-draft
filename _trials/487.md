abstract: "The United States and European countries differ fundamentally in redistributive policies and inequality levels. The present project investigates whether there are also systematic differences between the United States and Europe in social preferences. More specifically, the project studies how sources of inequality (merit and luck) affect inequality acceptance. In order to do this, we run a novel economic experiment on nationally representative samples."
