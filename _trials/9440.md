abstract: "This project investigates whether participants can strategically misrepresent information used for price discrimination. We create an artificial market, where participants of an experiment can buy a lottery. Prior to observing the price for the lottery, participants fill out a survey. We develop a statistical model which predicts the willingness to pay (WTP) for the lottery based on answers to the survey from the training sample. Based on this estimation, an individualized price is shown to the participants. Before filling out the survey, participants are informed that the answers could be used to determine the price. Thus, they could answer strategically, and right before observing the price, they are offered an option to hide the answers from the algorithm. We compare the ability to strategically bias answers in their favor between treatments that vary the survey: either survey used by insurance companies for risk profiling or survey of movie ratings. We also compare the demand for “hiding information.” In our intervention, we show participants the range of prices that could be realized depending on their answers to the survey, and hypothesize that it will increase the demand for “hiding information.” "
