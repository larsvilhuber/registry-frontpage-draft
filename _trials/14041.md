abstract: "We study demand for incentive schemes to foster agricultural technology adoption. In particular, we examine the relevance of asset market liquidity as a barrier for farmers who may be willing to experiment with new technologies (small mechanization assets). We define the liquidity of an asset as its ability to be realized as cash-on-hand. We elicit incentivized willingness to pay for a `buyback guarantee' scheme, the closest policy equivalent to easing the asset market liquidity constraint without affecting alternative channels. We use three types of small machinery (used at different stages of the crop cycle) that have been shown to increase agricultural yields in this context and elicit demand for the `buyback guarantee’.

We first quantify the relevance of this constraint through the willingness to pay exercise (Becker-Degroot-Marshak mechanism) in a method similar to the one in Berry et al (2020). We further try to understand factors that affect valuation from the perspective of environmental variability, uncertainty about assets’ returns, and preferences. 

We complement the elicitation with a randomized survey experiment (where liquidity is randomly assigned to an asset) and measurement of perception of asset characteristics (returns, perceived liquidity, prices) for both assets individuals own, and the three investment assets used for the buyback.
