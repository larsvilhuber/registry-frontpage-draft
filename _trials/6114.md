abstract: "Parties in procurement contracting often lack information about the capabilities or actions of their potential partners.  Hiring is a special case of labor procurement where bilateral asymmetric information plays an important role in the efficiency of matching talent to appropriate opportunities (Oyer and Schaefer, 2010).  Several practices may reduce information asymmetry in hiring and other procurement contexts, but the use and efficacy of these practices is unclear.  Two recommendations are: 1) test applicants and stage information gathering, where a buyer observes small portions of work before committing to a larger project, and 2) introduce competition among applicants.  This project seeks to understand the effects of these practices for online procurement outcomes.  An additional goal is to measure whether informational treatments make buyers more likely to adopt best practices and to understand determinants of buyersâ€™ uses of different practices."
