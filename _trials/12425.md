abstract: "This study explores whether virtual intergroup contact enhances social cohesion between refugees and host communities. Given the rising number of refugees, tensions between refugees and host communities have intensified. While intergroup contact has been widely studied as a means to alleviate such tensions, the potential of virtual intergroup contact remains underexplored. To address this gap, we will conduct a randomized control trial in Bangladesh, a major host country for Rohingya refugees from Myanmar. We developed an original online gaming application where participants collaborate in teams to harvest fruit from a shared farm. In the treatment groups, teams will include computer-generated players (bots) representing Rohingya refugees, enabling us to simulate virtual intergroup interactions and flexibly adjust both the performance of these bots and the duration of interactions. We will assess its impact on general attitudes towards refugees, hostility through an incentivized joy-of-destruction experiment, and implicit bias using the list experiment technique."
