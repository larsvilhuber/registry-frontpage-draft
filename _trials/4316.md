abstract: "We experimentally study how under- and overreaction to new information is affected by complexity. Our hypothesis is that people are more likely to underreact to news when information is complex and difficult to process, leading to context dependence in expectation formation. In our experiment, subjects predict future values of variable A. In the simple treatment, A follows an AR(1), and subjects only observe past values of A. In the complex treatment, subjects additionally observe a leading indicator B, with A and B jointly generated by a bivariate VAR(1). Our experimental design ensures that the predictability and persistence of A are kept constant across treatments. We investigate how under- and overreaction to new information varies with complexity."
