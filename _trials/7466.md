abstract: "This study will contribute to a better understanding of the motivation of workers active on microtask online platforms. Recent literature has focused mainly on self-reported motivation and thus measured stated preferences (SP), but little has been done to investigate revealed work preferences (RP). Therefore add to the existing literature by investigating RP of MTurkers in the US and India, the two largest MTurker groups.
Because of the higher average income in the USA (Prydz & Wadhwa, 2019), the amount of payment on MTurk constitutes a low stake in the USA and a high stake in India. Since low stakes and high stakes can have an impact on worker motivation, we examine possible differences between RP of workers from the USA and India.
In this study we will run a partial profile design conjoint analysis in which MTurkers can choose the job they later perform. In particular, we will investigate (1) whether the RP of MTurkers are in line with the findings of previous research; (2) whether SP and RP of MTurkers are inline in our study; and (3) whether high or low stakes in terms of payment affect SP and RP of MTurkers.
