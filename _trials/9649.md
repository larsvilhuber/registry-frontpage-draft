abstract: "Algorithms are often more efficient in strategic decision-making than humans, but humans show aversion against the use of algorithmic support. In non-algorithmic contexts, overconfident individuals are less likely to delegate decisions. The aim of this study is to analyze whether individuals are averse against algorithms or rather overconfident concerning their capabilities. To disentangle the effect of overconfidence and control over algorithms on the use of algorithmic support, I conduct an online experiment. I analyze whether information about the current performance can reduce overconfidence and increases the use of algorithmic support. Moreover, I examine whether the use and the willingness-to-pay for algorithmic support significantly differs, if individuals can either delegate their decisions to an algorithm or instead can receive algorithmic advice."
