abstract: "This experiment studies the effects of providing information regarding life long learning on enrollment in adult education and labor market outcomes.The information consisted of a pamphlet from Finlandâ€™s Service Centre for Continuous Learning and Employment (SECLE) that described the returns to adult education and provided guidance for applying and seeking financial support. The information was targeted to individuals in Finland without secondary education. The target group contained roughly 200,000 individuals from whom 50,000 were randomly selected to the treatment group. We will estimate the effects of this experiment using register data."
