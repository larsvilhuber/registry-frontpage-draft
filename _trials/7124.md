abstract: "Low-income students are at greater risk of becoming disengaged with their schooling, including lower attendance, disciplinary actions, and drop-out. This evaluation will assess the effectiveness of a program designed to provide the necessary support for students to overcome such adversity, increasing the likelihood of high school graduation and post-secondary success, in schooling and/or the labor market. This effort is conducted in partnership with two urban school districts in the eastern United States. The program provides students with wraparound services including a professional, trained mentor in addition to academic support (e.g., tutoring, state exam prep). Students also receive job readiness training, employment support, and opportunities to build life skills. The participating school districts serve more eligible students who exhibit risk factors for dropping out than can be served. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) study will involve 2,500 eligible students over two years with approximately 1,500 students offered treatment. Control students will not have access to this program, but will have access to standard services provided by the school, district, and community. Youth are recruited to enroll in ninth grade and, if interested, participate in the program throughout high school. Enrollment occurred in the 2017-18 and 2018-19 school years. Given the current ages of these student cohorts, current outcomes of interest include an index of indicators contributing to a student being “on-track” for high school graduation."
