abstract: "Participation in sport activities is a potential but under-investigated driver of child development. This project evaluates whether the exposure of children from disadvantaged neighborhoods to sport-related activities, i.e., a class on healthy lifestyle and 1-year free access to sport facilities, has the potential to foster wellbeing, inclusion, and social skills.
