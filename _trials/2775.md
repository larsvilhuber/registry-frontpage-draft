abstract: "Prices tend to converge rapidly to competitive prices in traditional markets for non-durable goods. An open question has been whether and why the same applies in online markets in light of the increase in size, anonymity and information decentrality that characterizes them. We conduct
controlled experiments. 

We test the following main hypotheses:

[H1.] Direction of successful/unsuccessful bids and offers are reinforced/reverted.
[H2.] There are asymmetries in terms of adjustment size depending on whether a bid was successful/unsuccessful.
[H3.] The adjustment size depends (positively) on the level of the bid.
[H4.] Information affects the bid/offer behavior. (How does it affect findings regarding H1-H3?)
