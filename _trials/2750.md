abstract: "Teaching children to read is one of the most important school functions, but many students leave school without adequate reading skills. Intervening early may imply that at-risk students need not experience long periods of school failure, and, if problems can be prevented, early interventions could be more efficient than later interventions. This project studies a program targeting students in kindergarten and first grade, who have or are at-risk of developing reading difficulties. The program combines a focus on phonemic awareness and phonics, small-group or one-to-one tutoring, and multi-sensory learning methods. The intervention is evaluated with a randomized field experiment in 12 Swedish schools. Schools select those among their students that are most in need of extra help, who are then pre-tested, matched on the two primary outcome variables to pairs or triples, and randomly assigned to a treatment or a waitlist control group. Primary outcome measures for the short run effects of the intervention are two standardized tests of decoding and letter knowledge. Secondary outcomes are a researcher-developed measure of phonological awareness, and three measures aimed to capture aspects of student motivation and self-efficacy. "
