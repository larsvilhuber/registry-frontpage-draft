abstract: "Despite the central goal of providing medical treatment based on need there are well-known and persistent socioeconomic inequalities in all developed healthcare systems. Based on register and survey data, recent studies indicate that part of the problem relates to physician behaviour; physicians treat patients with equal care need differently depending on patients' socioeconomic status (SES). However, due to data limitations further analysis, using other methods, is required to establish a socioeconomic bias in healthcare provision and to study the underlying mechanisms. The objective of this project is to investigate whether and how patient SES influences physician decision-making, using economic experiments based on video-recordings of individuals describing their real health problems in a standardised, consultation-like setting. The “video patients” suffer from similar health problems but have different SES. The project consists of two economic experiments, where students of and graduates from medical professional programs participate. In the first experiment we investigate the alignment of SES-perceptions among a first group of experiment participants, who are asked to categorize patients according to SES after viewing individual videos. In the second experiment we investigate whether there is a socioeconomic bias in physician decision-making, by letting a second participant group assess the healthcare need of video patients."
