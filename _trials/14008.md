abstract: "This research aims to explore the concept of "Decency" (Ellingsen and Mohlin, 2019) in the context of organ donation. The study employs a novel experimental design to probe the underlying motivations influencing individuals to register as organ donors, particularly examining whether these motivations are rooted in decency or altruism. Using an incentivized experiment, the research analyses the willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid the registration decision and the subsequent choices made when participants are unavoidably confronted with it. The primary hypothesis of this study posits that individuals demonstrating a higher level of decency are more likely to register as organ donors when directly faced with the decision, even if they initially attempted to avoid it. This contrasts with those exhibiting a lower level of decency, who may also try to avoid the decision or not attempt to avoid it at all. Such behavior suggests that decency, rather than mere altruism, primarily drives the decision to register, especially in light of their initial reluctance. Our subjects are recruited with ORSEE (Greiner, 2015).
