abstract: "The Excel Centers (TEC) are tuition-free charter public high schools that award high school diplomas to adults and provide child care, housing and transportation assistance, college credit, and industry-recognized certification courses to help students overcome barriers and continue their education. Through a randomized controlled trial, we will investigate the impact of two behavioral interventions on enrollment and persistence in TEC, with a possible follow-up study examining the impact of increased enrollment and graduation on long-term educational, financial, and labor market outcomes.

The first intervention involves a one-on-one orientation with a life coach before the start of classes. During these orientations, the coach first leads the applicant through a mindfulness breathing exercise before engaging in mental imagery. This involves visualizing their graduation and dream job, as well as writing a letter to their future selves on the day of their graduation. Such exercises have proven effective in other contexts, especially among populations with a history of trauma (Ashraf et al., 2022). The goal of this intervention is to alter “what comes to mind” for students (Gennaioli and Shleifer, 2010): where students previously might think of past difficulties in school, now they may think of their coach and their visualized future (e.g. career or educational goals). By also facilitating a close bond with coaches, this intervention could cascade to increased student engagement and persistence in the program. The second intervention is an advertising video that seeks to reduce perceived barriers of program attendance: depending on the recipient’s age, it features either a single mother or middle-aged man navigating barriers to success at TEC to eventually earn their diplomas.

The research team will enroll 5,000 individuals into the study over 18 months, with enrollees being randomly assigned into one of four groups: (i) being offered only the video, (ii) being offered only the one-on-one orientation, (iii) being offered both the video and the orientation, and (iv) being offered only TEC’s standard services, which do not include either the video or the one-on-one orientation.
