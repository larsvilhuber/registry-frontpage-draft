abstract: "The purpose of this trial is to produce a robust evidence base about the impact of social action on young people, including a specific focus on their general skills. Specifically, this trial aims to evaluate the the partner (CF hereafter) programme of work funded by the Cabinet Office centre for social action. 
Evidence in this area is currently sparse and, where it does exist, is inconsistent. As such this research will have significant implications for future policy making and funding decisions in this area.
The two primary questions that this trial aims to answer are:
1.	Does taking part in the CF programme boost the employability of participants?

2.	Are participantsâ€™ general skills (as measured by this trial), improved by taking part in the CF programme?
