abstract: "We study the effects of speed-schools for older children in Niger. In this plan we describe the hypotheses to be tested and how they will be tested. The description includes how the variables are coded, how we will deal with missing values, and the specification of the estimation equations. We also conduct a power analysis which suggests that we are able to identify relatively small differences. All deviations from the plan will be highlighted in the final paper."
