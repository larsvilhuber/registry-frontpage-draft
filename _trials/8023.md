abstract: "I propose to conduct a lab experiment in which some participants will be given the choice between opting into whether they receive information about their performance relative to their peers or not, and compare their subsequent behavior to those who were randomly not given the choice.  This study will seek to disentangle the effect that forcing participants to receive peer information or not may have in contributing to the adverse responses observed in the literature."
