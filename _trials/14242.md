abstract: "The research project aims to investigate one mechanism that could contribute to the phenomenon of overconfidence, namely the feedback individuals receive from others. We study this mechanism in the context of parents providing feedback to their child, which constitutes a key instance where this mechanism may be important. This lab-in-the-field experiment will allow parents to choose to send their child feedback in the form of an assessment of their future or past performance in different scenarios. 

Within this context, we will address three main research questions. First, focusing on parents, we ask whether parents tailor the feedback they send to boost their child’s confidence. Second, we explore whether parents’ feedback decisions differ according to the (perceived) gender congruence of the task, comparing feedback behavior for a stereotypically male task (mathematics) with a stereotypically female task (Norwegian). Third, we shift attention to the child and ask whether the feedback decisions of parents influence the child’s beliefs and performance. Specifically, we ask whether parents’ feedback influences the gender gap in confidence, motivation, and performance of children (e.g., does parental feedback have a more positive influence on confidence in gender-congruent tasks). Our study will help to reveal the aims of parents in distorting the feedback they provide to their children.
