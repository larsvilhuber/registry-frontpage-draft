abstract: "It has been widely acknowledged that the grounds for a healthy and productive future are shaped early on for every child. Inadequate health and nutrition, child rearing practices with limited interaction between parents and children, and home environments with few books, toys, and other learning opportunities may all contribute towards poor cognitive growth and overall child development. Early deficits can have life-long consequences, including lower levels of school participation and performance, lower future earnings and income, increased reliance on the health care system and higher rates of criminality (Walker et al., 2001; Naudeau et al., 2010).  

The evidence from recent research suggests that well targeted and defined early interventions can accrue positive and sustainable development outcomes (Engle et. al, 2011; Hoddinott et. al, 2008; Gertler et. al, 2014). Among different policy alternatives, center-based child care interventions have proven to be effective in different country settings (Martinez et. al., 2012; Noboa-Hidalgo and Urzúa, 2012), and the provision of public and high quality child care services has become a desired intervention for expanding coverage within early childhood development (ECD) programs.

The Early Childhood Development Unit (UDIT) within the Bolivia’s Ministry of Health (MS) is launching a pilot program in the departments of Chuquisaca and Potosi, which aims to improve the cognitive, socio-emotional and physical development of vulnerable children under four years of age through increased access to early intervention services. The Program encompasses a series of components financed by a loan from the Inter-American Development Bank, including a facility improvement intervention for eligible existing child care centers, as well as an upgrade in quality standards and guidelines in these centers. 

The program includes an experimental impact evaluation design where eligible child care centers are randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. The evaluation will measure the causal effect of the intervention on different measures of the quality of services offered, including structural factors and processes indicators, and child development outcomes in the long run.
