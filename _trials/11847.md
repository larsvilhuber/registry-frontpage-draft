abstract: "The ability of governments to expand access to reliable energy runs aground when state capacity is limited. Weak enforcement creates a leaky bucket in power sectors across the developing world as theft and unpaid bills go unchecked. Utilities, desperate to stanch further losses, are forced to restrict electricity supply and raise prices on those who do pay. Faced with bad supply and ever higher prices, customers choose to exit the grid or give up paying altogether, creating a negative fiscal spiral. Until this cycle is broken, governments remain stuck propping up ailing power sectors using scarce capital or are forced to cut back their investments into expanding access. Either outcome harms those in poverty as their access to energy gets cut and the price of electricity rises. Pakistan embodies this sorry tale: its power sector debt exceeds 5.2% of GDP, total losses surpass 25%, remote areas face hours of load shedding a day, and annual power subsidies exceed the country’s joint budget on social protection and education. In short, theft due to a lack of enforcement acts as a supply-side cost on the system, lowering the total electricity that can be produced and supplied to the poor. Perhaps counter-intuitively, enhancing enforcement in this setting can therefore raise the wellbeing of the poor over time.
If individuals judge the probability of punishment from the state to be low then other factors drive the decision to pay. Our hypothesis, based on ongoing fieldwork in Pakistan and from our long-standing research in Bihar, India, is that changing social norms might be a cost-effective way to enhance enforcement in these areas. Our aim is to evaluate a novel intervention backed by the government of Pakistan that seeks to shift social norms on the payment of electricity in areas beyond the reach of the state. If successful, this innovation could offer a cost-effective way to expand access to energy in poor, rural areas of the developing world that grapple with enforcement problems.
We plan to use influential agents in local communities to shift norms on paying for electricity by disseminating messages against theft to residents. In our context these messages will primarily be delivered through religious institutions (mosques). On a smaller scale we will test delivering secular messages through social gatherings led by community elders. We partner with Akhuwat, a prominent Islamic Microfinance institution, to design and implement the treatments."
