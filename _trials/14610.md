abstract: "We study whether shareholders have different perspectives on leadership (board / manager, 'BM' hereafter) diversity, and if these beliefs correctly represent the actions of the BM. For this purpose, we propose an environment where market participants can trade shares of a firm, whose value depends on the decisions made by the BM earlier. Market participants do not know what decision was made, and act on the belief of what the BM might have done. "
