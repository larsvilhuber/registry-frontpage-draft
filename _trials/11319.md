abstract: "Several studies show a positive effect of deposit contracts on increasing physical activity. To be effective, the commitment device must be accepted by participants. Most studies show that take-up rates in a loss-framed design are very low. Loss aversion explains both the significant effects of deposit contracts and low take-up rates. Therefore, we designed a RCT in which safety nets make the loss-framed incentive more acceptable for participants without reducing the effects of loss aversion on behavior change.

We have developed a between-subject randomized controlled trial to test the effects of safety nets on goal achievement, defined as steps per day. Approximately 300 participants between the ages of 18 and 85 will be randomly assigned to one of four experimental treatments or the control treatment. Each participant will set his own goal (e.g., 9,000 steps per day) to achieve during the intervention period of 20 days. Furthermore, we focus on repeated bets, so that each participant can decide everyday if he wants to accept the challenge the next day. We want to find out how the incentives are optimally designed and whether the prospect of a safety net as well as repeated bets lead  first to higher take-up rates and second to a higher goal achievement.

We run the experiment within an ongoing 365-day long study with subjects who are all seeking to improve their physical activity. All participants have been positively health screened, are using a smartphone app (ActiVAtE Behavior) to transmit their steps (main performance measure) in a timely manner and have already provided extensive individual data at the time of the intervention. While all participants indicated in the application questionnaire that they were eager to walk more steps per day, there is a large variation in ex-ante daily steps submitted via a smartphone app over the past 9 months. Since the daily goal is set by the participants themselves, there is also a corresponding variation in individual goals. Furthermore, we have a very rich dataset on each individual, including not only activity data before, during, and after the intervention, but also a wide variety of preferences (measured via economic laboratory experiments) as well as sociodemographic data and individual attitudes and self-reported behavior (measured via questionnaires).
