abstract: "Building on evidence from the Enhanced Transitional Jobs Demonstration (ETJD), we will evaluate the effectiveness of Goodwill of North Georgia’s (GNG) Workforce Development program via an RCT. In the program, job seekers at one of GNG’s 13 Career Centers are provided access to services aimed at connecting individuals with gainful employment. Intensive job preparation and career services train program participants to work in one of a number of occupations or industries, such as welding, construction, medical building, technology, maintenance, CDL, forklift, and supply chain. Trainees participate in short, 4–16 week training programs that end with the attainment of an industry-recognized credential. During the training period, participants are connected with paid work-based learning opportunities and are supported by a career coach that helps them overcome employment barriers and focus not just on getting a job, but on identifying their career pathway. In order to evaluate the effects of the program on outcomes like quarterly employment, quarterly earnings, and SNAP benefit utilization, we will enroll 1000 participants into the study, randomizing 500 to receive GNG’s Workforce Development services and 500 to control."
