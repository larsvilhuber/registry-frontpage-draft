abstract: "We embed a randomised control trial (RCT) into a survey representative of the German online population ("Bundesbank-Online-Panel-Households (BOP-HH)"). In the experiment, randomly selected subsets of respondents get information on the current inflation rate. The main idea of the RCT is to establish a causal link between perceived past inflation rates and expected future inflation rates by exogenously shifting individuals' perceptions about past inflation and analyzing the effect of the resulting change in perceptions on inflation expectations."
