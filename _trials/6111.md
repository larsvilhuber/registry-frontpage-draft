abstract: "Substantial literature on survey response rates focuses on framing and the appeal to altruism as a motivation for participating, with methods like pre-survey post-cards and letters to incentivize cooperation, with evidence coming primarily from the U.S. and Europe. More recently, there has been interest in mobile phone surveys in low and middle income countries, where the efficacy of methods for improving response rates is not as well known. This study randomizes the use of pre-survey text messages, whether to send them and which type of appeal to make. The study also randomizes the messaging used in the consent script, appealing alternatively to “researcher” or “government” as the motivating authority, in the first round of experiments, and appeals to efficacy of participation and to self-interest with reminders about monetary compensation. The experiment is conducted in 11 random-digit dial (RDD) surveys in 10 countries, with followup surveys in 5 of those surveys."
