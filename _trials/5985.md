abstract: "The preference reversal phenomenon refers to a pattern of decisions under risk where decision makers explicitly value long-shot lotteries above more moderate ones but then choose the latter, in contradiction with Expected Utility Theory. The phenomenon is typically demonstrated in paradigms involving pairs of lotteries consisting of a relatively safe lottery, called the P-bet (for "probability"), and a riskier lottery offering a larger prize (a long shot), called the $-bet. Decision makers often choose the P-bet in the direct choice task, but explicitly value the $-bet above the P-bet, in contradiction with the most basic tenets of decision theories under risk, and specifically with the indifference between a lottery and its certainty equivalent. This phenomenon reveals an inconsistency between elicitation methods which should be equivalent.  

Salience theory postulates that reversals can occur because certain states are overweighted due to their salience. From a process perspective, this has a direct implication for visual attention. To test this hypothesis we conduct an eye-tracking experiment analyzing decisions under risk while implementing two treatments which manipulate salience. See the hypotheses in the attached pdf."
