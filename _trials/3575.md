abstract: "This study assesses the effects, on support for the state and insurgency, of a project that aims at reducing poverty in rural Afghanistan. It is based on a randomized experiment through which ultra-poor households in a northern province of Afghanistan received productive assets and training to graduate out of poverty. The study looks at the effects of the intervention on satisfaction with the government, participation in elections and sympathy with insurgency.   "
