abstract: "Using an online survey of Moscow residents, we plan to study the effect to which middle class affects civic and political participation in an authoritarian setting. We want to measure both individual-level and community-level effects, as well as their interaction. Our intuition is as follows: educated and upper-middle-income individuals are more politically and civically active, especially if they are employed in the private sector; at the same time, the presence of such individuals in the neighborhood may create an externality, creating more vibrant local politics and lowering the cost of civic and political participation for both middle class and those outside of it. The survey will contain an experimental question improving our ability to causally identify the effect of the individual's strata and environment on individual's civic engagement."
