abstract: "This project evaluates the role of information and incentives in improving the quality of last-mile service delivery in a large public welfare program in India. Last-mile government officials are provided detailed information on the quality of service delivery in their jurisdiction, and their career incentives are linked with their observed performance. In a later phase of the study, we intensify the granularity of the information. We use this variation to test the effect of this information relative to the incentives on average service delivery. In particular, we are focused on the improvement in the left tail of the distribution of beneficiaries, and will test whether treated officials direct their effort towards these units. We are also going to test heterogeneous treatment effects with respect to MIs’ pro-sociality and how accurate their prior beliefs on implementation quality are."
