abstract: "Water scarcity is becoming a global phenomenon. Examples can be found in California, Spain, India and also Namibia, where limited rainfall has caused the worst droughts in decades. As a cheap and fast way to reduce water demand, water utilities typically rely on mass communication to foster water conservation efforts among consumers. However, there seemingly exists no experimental evidence on how specific saving tips shoud be. This research project classifies saving tips by their specificity to provides first empirical evidence. Specific and less specific tips face a trade-off between simplicity and involving the recipient in the idea-generating process."
