abstract: "Agricultural productivity in Uganda is low and declining for many crops, including soybean. This is caused by limited adoption of climate-smart agricultural (CSA) innovations due to risks and uncertainties associated with increased incidences of droughts, floods, changes in prices, crop diseases/pests, and storm. High dependence on rain-fed agriculture means that farmers are vulnerable to climatic shocks and their impacts. To take risks and invest in CSA innovations, farmers will need incentives. Such incentives should address production and market risks as well as informational constraints, contemporaneously. The SNV-led ‘Climate Resilient Agribusiness for Tomorrow (CRAFT)’ program offers incentives including (1) farm-level training in CSA practices and technologies; (2) agricultural extension services; and (3) value-chain linkages (VC) through contracts and index-insurance to encourage smallholder farmers in Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania to adopt climate-smart agricultural innovations. Improved adoption would enhance productivity and household welfare. Through a field experiment, we assess the effectiveness of these incentives for the adoption of CSA innovations, and ensuing impacts on farming system resilience, productivity and household welfare. The key research questions are: what is the optimal combination of push and pull incentives for adoption of CSA practices and technologies; what are the impacts of CSA practices and technologies on factor productivity productivity, income and household welfare?
