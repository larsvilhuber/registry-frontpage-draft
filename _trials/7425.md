abstract: "We examine the effects of different incentive schemes on effort on a subjective classification task on the labor market platform MTurk. 
Subjective classification tasks are common strategies to gather information on tastes, attitudes, and develop training datasets for artificial intelligence. When the output of the task is subjective, designing effective incentive schemes is challenging because effort is difficult to observe. However, opinions are often given freely, suggesting that the cost of providing a subjective opinion is low (or even negative), so that incentivizing effort may be ineffective or even counterproductive if monitoring and incentives either crowd out altruistic motives or generate multi-tasking problems and potentially incentivize gaming.

This pilot broadly investigates how to incentivize respondents to perform a simple introspective task: classifying responses to an open-ended question according to “originality”. MTurk workers are asked to report both their first order beliefs (what they think) and their second order beliefs (what they think others think). Using several measures of respondent effort, we will compare the performance of workers under a range of different incentive schemes including fixed wage schemes, various forms of attention checks, and the Bayesian Truth Serum (BTS).

For each incentive scheme, we will examine the level of effort using a range of novel outcomes, including an incentivized measure of the degree of disutility associated with the task. We will use these measures to examine whether performance incentives for subjective tasks increases the level of effort, whether linking performance pay to particular sub-tasks creates crowds out effort on other tasks, and whether the effects of different incentive schemes are heterogeneous across people with different predispositions to exert effort when there are no performance incentives.
