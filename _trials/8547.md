abstract: "Objective: To determine whether assessed risks to oneself, assessed risks to the general population, and optimism bias about a variety of policy topics are affected by partisan informational cues. Half of the respondents will be randomized to receive a politically neutral version of the risk area and half to a version including a partisan clue. For example, risk of infection from COVID versus risk of infection from the flu; risk from a natural disaster with no attributed cause versus risk from a natural disaster caused by climate change, etc... Respondents will then be asked for their level of support for policies related to each of the topical areas used in the risk assessement."
