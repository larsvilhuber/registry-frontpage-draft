abstract: "Aflatoxin is a toxin affecting a variety of crops which induces harmful damage to the liver when ingested. Many countries have put in place regulations on the level of aflatoxin in food to address public health concerns.  This is not the case for many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, despite the prevalence of aflatoxin in crops. Groundnuts are one of the main crops in Senegal, both for sale and for consumption. Groundnuts are also highly susceptible to aflatoxin contamination.  Several studies have shown that aflatoxin is a health problem in Senegal, yet Senegal has no regulations on the level of aflatoxin in groundnut. This lack of regulation leads to two main problems for Senegalese groundnut farmers who are both producers and consumers: they have difficulty exporting their production and they face health risks related to the consumption of poor quality groundnuts. In this context of poor regulation, groundnut farmers have a key role in reducing and monitoring aflatoxin levels in their production. We explore three channels that could motivate farmers to test for aflatoxin contamination : a health channel ( as farmers consume what they produce, they could invest in aflatoxin testing because they consume it and do not want to eat harmful food), a financial gain channel (farmers might think they could find a buyer who would pay more for better quality production) and an altruistic channel ( farmers do not want their production to be harmful to the people who consume it.)
We designed a study that aims to explore the relative valuations farmers place on each of these channels, and how those valuations interact. We use a discrete choice experiment with randomized access to comprehensive information about aflatoxin, coupled with a Becker-DeGroot-Marshak mechanism to estimate the willingness to pay for access to information on aflatoxin levels in groundnuts among Senegalese groundnut farmers."
