abstract: "The goal of this study is to estimate the implicit price of carbon that people apply in their consumption decisions, which we call the People Shadow Price of Carbon (PSPC). We use an artefactual field experiment to recover a distribution of the PSPC among a target population. We also investigate whether extrinsic incentives could crowd-out the PSPC. Our focus is to show heterogeneity in the distribution of the PSPC. Finally, we illustrate the importance of the PSPC by conducting a policy analysis where we vary information and extrinsic incentives in a choice environment where consumers have to choose between bundle of goods and services with different carbon footprints."
