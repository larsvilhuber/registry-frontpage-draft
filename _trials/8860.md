abstract: "The expanded CTC pays a direct cash benefit of $3,000 for children ages 6-17 in tax year 2021 ($3600 for younger children). The benefit is available to families without income, and even if the childâ€™s parents are undocumented. Despite the generosity of this program, the US Treasury estimates that take up is incomplete. We propose an information and counseling intervention coupled with outreach and assistance through trusted partners to increase take-up of the Child Tax Credit in San Diego County with the hope of studying the effect of additional income from tax credits on school achievement and child well-being, such as parental labor supply, mental health, and food insufficiency."
