abstract: "In this work, we will examine the effect of SMS reminders on no-shows to mammograms through a controlled experiment emphasizing the effect of different behavioral mechanisms on the degree of influence of the messages. In particular, we will focus on two types of content. The first emphasizes the health cost that comes with failing to get a mammogram (a mechanism based on selfish consideration). The second is based on the harm to other women waiting in line for examination (a mechanism based on altruistic consideration). We will examine the effect of this content on the degree of non-arrival to examination relative to a laconic text reminder"
