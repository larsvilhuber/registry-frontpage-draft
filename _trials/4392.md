abstract: "This study examines the impact of peers, especially their genders and gender attitudes, on college students' educational expectation, performance, and persistence. Students in an economics course, who voluntarily sign up for a study group, are randomly assigned into groups of four. I will investigate if peers' gender and gender-related characteristics create academic spillover effects (i.e., impact on others' grades and educational choices). By comparing measurements in the baseline and endline, I can also investigate the change of expectations and beliefs, which is potentially an important mechanism of academic spillover effects. "
