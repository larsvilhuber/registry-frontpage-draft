abstract: "We investigate the impacts of subsidies for technology adoption, and how savings constraints aect
subsidy impacts. In a theoretical model in which risk-averse households face liquidity constraints as well
as incomplete insurance, alleviating savings constraints could promote persistence of technology adop-
tion over time (dynamic enhancement), or could instead reduce technology investment by encouraging
savings accumulation for other purposes (dynamic substitution). We implemented a eld experiment in
rural Mozambique, randomly assigning households one-time subsidies for adopting modern agricultural
technology (chiefy fertilizer). Entire localities were later randomly assigned programs facilitating formal
savings. In localities with no savings program, subsidy recipients raise their fertilizer use in the subsidized
season and for two subsequent unsubsidized seasons. By contrast, in savings-program localities, subsidy
impacts on fertilizer use do not persist: households shift resources away from fertilizer, instead accumu-
lating savings in formal bank accounts. The savings programs also appear to improve household ability
to cope with risk. These patterns are consistent with the theoretical case of dynamic substitution of
subsidies; alleviating savings constraints leads households to allocate their scarce resources in ways (such
as self-insurance and perhaps other investments) that compete with continued technology investments."
