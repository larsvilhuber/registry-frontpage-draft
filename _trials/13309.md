abstract: "We study how AI can influence economic interactions by enhancing humans' communication abilities. In particular, we use classic experimental games to investigate the effectiveness of AI-assisted communication within these economic settings: the Dictator Game, the Ultimatum Game, the Trust Game, and the Public Goods Game, aiming to discern the impact of suggestions generated by the state-of-the-art language models, GPT-4 (or 5) and Claude3 (or 4), on enhancing the communication abilities of participants. In our design, we allow players to send AI-aided unilateral pre-play messages to obtain better economic outcomes. Specifically, we assess whether AI assistance can enable players to persuade for larger transfers in the Dictator Game, achieve lower rejection rates or propose more successful lower offers in the Ultimatum Game, secure higher investments or return transfers in the Trust Game, and foster heightened cooperation in the Public Goods Game.
