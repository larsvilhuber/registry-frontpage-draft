abstract: "Background: Otilonium Bromide is a safe spasmolytic agent. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of otilonium bromide in upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.
Methods: The study was initiated as randomized and prospective in single center by experienced endoscopists. The patients were randomized into spasmolytic and control groups. In spasmolytic group, patients were administered 80 mg of otilonium bromide orally, 2 hours before the procedure. The control group took no medicine. 
Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed under topical anesthesia without any sedation. The endoscopist evaluated the motility and tolerability of the procedure. Moreover, another person evaluated the patients’ comments on the procedure. 
Results: There were 400 patients included into the study (257 female and 143 male). The mean age was 51.8 years. In the spasmolytic group, the tolerability of the procedure was evaluated as bad in 10%, moderate in 38% and good and very good in 52% of the procedures. In the control group, those rates were 21%, 53.5% and 30%, respectively (p<0.001).
In the spasmolytic group, intestinal motility was evaluated as no in 13%, mild in 70% and moderate in 17% of the procedures. In the control group the rates were as follows: 11.5%, 53.5% and 35% (p<0.001).
Conclusions: Otilonium bromide decreases the intestinal motility and can be used safely as a spasmolytic before the upper gastrointestinal system endoscopy. It can ease the procedure both for the endoscopist and the patient.
