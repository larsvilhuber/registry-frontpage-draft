abstract: "Interventions targeting early childhood development, such as preschools, are often seen as promising mechanisms to invest in human capital. This paper presents results from a Randomized Controlled Trial of a large scale preschool construction program in Cambodia, and indicates a cautionary tale. The overall impact of the program on a wide set of childrenâ€™s early childhood outcomes was small and not significant. Moreover, among the cohort with highest exposure (5 year olds) the program led to a negative impact on early childhood cognition. "
