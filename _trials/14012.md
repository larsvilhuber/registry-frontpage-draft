abstract: "This is a pilot study for a project studying how the use of inclusive language (in particular gender-neutral language) affects support for different public policies and the persuasiveness of messages aiming to boost support for certain policies. 

In Spanish, like many gendered-grammar languages spoken by 39% of the world population (Jakiela and Ozier, 2018), all nouns are assigned to a male or female gender. The traditional default is to use the masculine form as a “generic” when referring to an unspecified sex. A growing (and controversial) movement has challenged this norm, making it a political issue. For example, "employee" in Spanish is either the male noun "empleado" or the female noun "empleada," and historically there has been no word for a non-gendered "employee." Gender-neutral language in our context consists of stating "empleado o empleada" instead of only "empleado" when referring to an "employee.”

In an online survey in Spanish, Peruvian citizens will be provided with short briefs and policy proposals on two context-relevant topics: a social issue related to diversity (bilingual education) and an economic issue (labor informality). The research design cross-randomizes two aspects of the briefs and proposals that respondents see: i) whether the proposed policy is progressive (left-wing) or conservative (right-wing); and ii) whether gender-neutral language is used in the briefs.

This research design allows us to estimate the effect of gender-neutral language on the persuasiveness of the briefs (i.e., if using it makes the respondent more or less likely to support the proposal) separately for progressive and conservative messages and for each of the issues we study. For example, our design allows us to test if gender-neutral language makes a progressive (left-wing) message on an economic issue less persuasive, but would have smaller effects if the message was conservative or if it was about a social issue. 

The research design also randomizes the salience of gender-neutral language (whether the respondent sees both proposals with gender-neutral language, both proposals without it, or one proposal with or without gender-neutral language).
