abstract: "In developing economies, commercial transactions frequently occur within the informal economy, with often surprising degrees of contractual complexity. By its non-legal nature, informal contracts will rarely be enforced by Law, hence contacts depend on inter-personal trust and reputation between contracting agents. Interpersonal trust can stem from different sources: education, culture, history, etc. We posit that interpersonal trust, mostly in what relates to commerce, depends on institutions, formal and informal. In the context of extreme degrees of informality in the economy, and in the presence of weak official institutions, such as in Bolivia, inter-personal trust might emanate more from unofficial than from official sources. 
This experiment intends to measure interpersonal trust based upon Bergâ€™s experiment (1995), in which the game is slightly modified by allowing players to build up trust aided by the presence of four types of institutions. In a repeated and finite game, the situation is framed as an investment game in which trustors can invest in a business opportunity with a randomly matched entrepreneur (the trustee). The entrepreneur can choose how much to reimburse the investor, which may be less than the initial investment. The randomly assigned institutions can (i) punish low reimbursements (formal institution), (ii) punish low reimbursements but with some low probability (formal imperfect institution), (iii) inform the investor on the reimbursement history of the matched entrepreneur (reputation as an informal institution), and (iv) inform the entrepreneur of the previous aggregate behavior of the group of entrepreneurs (social norm as an informal institution).  We hypothesize that while the formal punitive institution should be conducive to larger investments, imperfect formal institutions might be as effective or less than informal institutions in building up trust.
