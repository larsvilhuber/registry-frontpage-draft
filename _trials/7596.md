abstract: "In this research project, we want to examine the determinants of public support for rent control policies. By means of a randomized survey experiment among a representative sample of 18,000 eligible voters in Germany, we aim at getting a better understanding of how
people reason about regulation in the housing market. In the survey experiment, we will confront participants with diﬀerent aspects of the housing market in Berlin, rent control and its consequences and subsequently elicit their attitudes towards the
Berlin rent cap (a rent control policy introduced in Berlin in 2020 and overturned by the Federal Constitutional Court in April 2021) . By comparing the eﬀect of various information treatments, we will be able to infer which aspects of rent control drive respondents’ support for the Berlin rent cap."
