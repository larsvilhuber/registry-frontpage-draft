abstract: "Following the Russian war against Ukraine, Germany is suffering from a gas supply shortage. As a result, energy prices are skyrocketing and both the government and public utilities undertake efforts to encourage energy savings of households. We run a natural field experiment in cooperation with one of the largest energy suppliers in Germany to test a reminder intervention among households participating in an energy savings program. As part of that program, all households receive 5 cents for each kilowatt-hour natural gas they save during the winter 2022/2023 in comparison to previous years. However literature has shown, that many interventions lose effectiveness after a few months. We thus randomize mailings during that energy savings program which remind households of their initial energy savings plans. "
