abstract: "The Social Security Administration (SSA) has contracted with a team led by Abt Associates Inc. including Mathematica Policy Research to implement and evaluate the Benefit Offset National Demonstration (BOND), an important new policy initiative for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) beneficiaries. This project provides funding for Mathematica to assist Abt Associates with design, implementation, and evaluation of the project. The project was implemented in 2011. BOND is testing different program variants for current SSDI beneficiaries in 10 locations around the country. In the models to be tested, benefits gradually will be reduced when the beneficiary has earnings over a specific amount, instead of being cut to $0 (as under current law). Those who earn less than that specific amount will receive the same benefit as under current law. One model will test enhanced work incentives counseling combined with the benefit offset, along with information and referral to employment supports."
