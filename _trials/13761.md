abstract: "This study investigates the determinants of internet adoption by small and medium firms and its effects on firm outcomes. We use an experiment conducted in Tajikistan in 2014 in which a randomly selected group of firms received help to register for electronic tax filing, leading to a higher likelihood of e-filing use. We use this variation to study the impact on internet adoption by firms as well as the short- and long-term impact of internet on firm outcomes using data from surveys conducted in 2016 and 2020, administrative data, and online checks conducted in 2023 to assess impacts on firmsâ€™ online activity and survival.
