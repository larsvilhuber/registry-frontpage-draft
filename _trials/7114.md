abstract: "We conduct an RCT in Bhutan to examine the effects of providing future job prospect information to high school students and their parents on their tertiary education choices. We measure how biased their baseline beliefs about the returns to tertiary education are, and provide the information about future employment prospects disaggregated by the career choices at graduation of secondary school: no further education, vocational training, and university with different majors. We estimate whether the information provision changes the beliefs, preference, and their actual choices on tertiary education. Our study subjects are nearly all of the high school students in Grade 12 who are about to graduate and make educational choices in Bhutan. "
