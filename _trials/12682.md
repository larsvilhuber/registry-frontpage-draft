abstract: "The project aims at understanding how SMEs approach taxes and how tax policy can be improved accordingly. In particular, the study tries to elicit explanations for why firms bunch in "dominated regions" above tax schedule discontinuities in Zambia. To this end, a survey (-experiment) on turnover taxpayers will be conducted. Information on the way firms file their taxes, their interaction with the Zambia Revenue Authority, and on how they keep records of business activities will be collected. This may yield relevant behavioral patterns which can help to understand the bunching behavior. ‚Å†In addition, randomly assigned information treatments on audit probabilities as well as tax clearance requirements to secure government contracts will allow to causally identify the determinants of the observed bunching behavior."
