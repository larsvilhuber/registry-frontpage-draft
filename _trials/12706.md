abstract: "We are launching a survey that elicits consumer preferences over inflation. The survey embeds an RCT, featuring five information treatments and one control group. The survey also includes questions that explore potential rationales for preferences expressed; vignettes--wherein random numbers for long-run inflation are presented--that elicit preferences in hypothetical contexts; and a task that confronts respondents with a trade-off between stabilizing inflation and stabilizing unemployment.
