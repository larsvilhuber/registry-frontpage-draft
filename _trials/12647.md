abstract: "The Assistance for Change and Economic Growth for Food Security (Asistencia para el Cambio y Crecimiento EconÃ³mico por la Seguridad Alimentaria, ACCESO) program is an emergency food security intervention program implemented by World Vision Guatemala. Prior to the start of any intervention activities, in 3 of ACCESO's operational departamentos, 50 villages were randomly allocated to intervention (n=19) or control (n=31).  Two villages' leadership refused participation in the intervention program, resulting in a total of 48 villages within this cluster RCT. In the first year of the intervention program, vulnerable households will receive four monthly cash transfers of $110 each (Q860) in July, August, September, and October 2023. They will additionally receive a ceramic water filter (Ecofiltro) and a handwashing station with soap. Households in both intervention and control communities will be screened and enrolled into this cluster RCT research study starting on 4December 2023, using vulnerability criteria utilized by the intervention implementer to enroll houses into the intervention program April-June 2023. Primary outcomes will be 1) reported moderate or severe hunger in September of 2023  (according to Household Hunger Score, with modified extended recall period to specific month of September),  and 2) household drinking water quality (E. coli >0 colony forming units/100mL). Analysis will be intention to treat, and secondary analyses will be per-protocol based on households that received the ACCESO intervention.  Secondary outcomes will include other indicators of food security including  Food Consumption Score (last 7 days, binary "acceptable" or not, as well as continuous), Reduced Coping Strategies Index (last 7 days, continuous), and Household Hunger Score in previous 30 days (binary, moderate/severe hunger or not), and reported respiratory illness or diarrhea among children <5yrs of age within the previous 7 days.
