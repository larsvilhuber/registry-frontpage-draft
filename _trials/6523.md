abstract: "Community-led, shared book-reading interventions can improve early childhood development and reduce inequity. One such program, We Love Reading (WLR), was implemented in Jordan in response to the Syrian refugee crisis and involves mothers reading stories to children. This research project will use qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate the potentially transformative nature of WLR among Syrian refugees in Jordan. Specifically, we will interview stakeholders (Syrian refugee parents and 7-18 year old children) and will conduct a cluster randomised controlled trial with Syrian refugee mothers and their 4-8-year-old children. We will use semi-structured interviews for the qualitative component. We will use multiple methods in this wait-listed, cluster randomized controlled trial - including survey measures, behavioural assessments, and participant observation - immediately before and immediately after the WLR intervention. The goal of this evaluation study is to understand how WLR may impact Syrian refugee childrenâ€™s educational trajectories, literacy, and love of reading.
