abstract: "A belief in the malleability of intelligence is what psychologists refer to as a growth mindset.  Experimental work in social psychology has demonstrated that students who develop a growth mindset perform significantly better than students who do not.  We attempt to replicate this work in Norway and to "translate" growth mindsets into the realm of behavioral economics.  We hypothesize that growth mindset could be related to such behavioral concepts as patience, perceptions of the cost of effort, confidence and overconfidence, and risk taking.  We test these in two steps.  First, using a growth mindset intervention previously designed by social psychologists, we experimentally test whether the intervention leads to increased likelihoods of students exhibiting growth mindsets.  Most particularly, we examine changes in mindset among students who previously did not display a growth mindset. These tend to be students with low GPA prior to the intervention and students who attend vocational track. We measure mindset immediately after and again after a couple of weeks.  Second, we measure the economic behaviors described above for treatment and control.  The comparisons of treatment and control in this second stage provide some insight into the mechanisms by which growth mindset might change student behavior.  "
