abstract: "A growing literature suggests that people are willing to accept more inequality if it is the result of merit rather than the result of luck. However, it is often difficult, if not impossible, to relate economic success or inequality to the relative impact of the luck or merit. In this study, we investigate distributional situations in which the relative impact of luck and merit is uncertain.
