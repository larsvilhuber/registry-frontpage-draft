abstract: "I examine whether and how people's beliefs about gender differences in wages causally affect their demand for related policy interventions and shed light on underlying mechanisms. For the experimental study which I outline in a pre-analysis plan I collect novel data from a large sample of adults from the U.S. via an online survey. The experiment proceeds in two waves: In the first wave, I ask all respondents to give their incentivized best guess on the wage difference between men and women with specified characteristics. Afterward, participants who were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups receive information on the wage statistic based on one of two recent household surveys conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. A pure control group does not receive any information update. I use self-reported and behavioral measures in order to elicit all respondents' demand for policy interventions related to women's progress in the labor market. This set-up allows me to examine the effect of information and ultimately of beliefs regarding the gender wage gap on demand for related government intervention. I also examine how people update their beliefs about underlying reasons for gender differences in wages when exposed to information about these wage differences. The second wave of the experiment consists in an obfuscated follow-up survey which is performed two to three weeks after the first wav in order to examine the persistence of any initial information treatment effect in a setting where potential experimenter demand effects are mitigated.
