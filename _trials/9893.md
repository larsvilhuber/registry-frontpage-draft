abstract: "This pre-analysis plan details our experimental design and pre-analysis plan for an experiment on the role of institutional design on the relative success of male and female candidates in a business plan competition. We run an experiment in which judges are randomly assigned to both a committee treatment (as opposed to judging individually) and to a prompt detailing the importance of equal opportunity for male and female entrepreneurs. We pre-specify both our main reduced form analysis and a structural model yielding as main hypothesis that when members of a committee face social pressure to agree with each other, they overweight public information, generating status quo bias. We also pre-specify a more flexible generalisation of the model to test alternate hypotheses. "
