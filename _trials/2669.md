abstract: "Today's students face many pressures vying to capture their attention, and undergraduate curricula increasingly rely on self-directed content exposure that occurs outside of the traditional classroom. This combination may exacerbate behavioral failures inhibiting human capital production. In a previous experiment we found that email nudges to focus on certain ungraded problems available online had little impact on student performance on questions very similar to those on the exam. We realized that students focused on the graded assignments with relatively few attempting to do the ungraded “nudged” problems. In this study we test whether nudges to focus on graded assignments with the message that such problems are likely to appear on the exam sent to a random subset of students within each class help students focus on core concepts more than when graded assignments are not nudged.  In addition, we test whether nudges to practice ungraded problems also with the hint that “questions like these are likely to appear on the exams” increases student time spent online with the ungraded problems and enhances performance on the test.  Nudges to focus on practice problems will also be sent to a random sub-sample within each class. Lastly we will vary the amount each graded assignment counts towards their final grade to see if exercises that count more garner more online effort and improve performance on  exams."
