abstract: "With the disruption in classroom learning caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, many students may be falling behind in their learning trajectory and less prepared to begin their next grade in the fall.  Some researchers are predicting a 30-50% loss in learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic across subjects and up to a year’s worth of learning loss in mathematics, and there is evidence to suggest that the pandemic will reify and exacerbate existing systemic inequalities.  Most U.S. school districts have turned to remote learning to mitigate this learning loss, however, they face many challenges to ensuring that high quality content is delivered and utilized by students, including technical access, curriculum building, and student engagement. We are partnering with Chicago Public Schools (CPS) to conduct three large-scale randomized controlled trials to try to understand what works to engage and support students in a virtual summer learning program.

In the first RCT, we will randomize students eligible for the Summer Learning program who do not register by CPS’ deadline into intensive outreach treatment to learn how we can better encourage families to sign up for this program. In the second and third RCTs, we study how we can best increase student engagement with remote learning and the online Khan Academy platform offered by the Summer Learning program by randomizing students to receiving different forms of learning and engagement support. We hope the three studies will inform future planning and implementation of remote learning efforts in the district in the coming school year.  "
