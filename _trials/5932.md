abstract: "This experimental design is implemented in collaboration with the NGO Chile Transparencia.  Beginning in February 2020 the Chilean Comptroller General Office rolled out 167 audits in municipalities throughout the country.  The treatment consists of the audit report for each municipality in addition to a short information video that highlights the extent to which the municipality has high or low malfeasance counts.  We have recruited approximately 49,000 online subjects from these municipalities (plus a control group of 177 non-audited municipalities).  All 10,000 subjects will receive a pre-treatment survey measuring their pre-treatment beliefs regarding corruption in their municipality.   
 
Within each audited municipality subjects randomly assigned to the treatment will receive a video publicizing the municipality's audit report -- those randomly assigned to control will receive a placebo ad.  We organize the outcomes from this information treatment into three groupings: 1) beliefs about the prevalence of corruption; 2) the salience of these beliefs, and 3) whether these beliefs affect voting behaviour.  Relatively few of these audit studies directly measure belief updating as a response to malfeasance information treatments. 

Treated subjects are targeted with video treatment within five days of the release of the audit report.  A post-treatment survey will be conducted for two weeks and one month after the audit report is released.  They are questioned again regarding their beliefs about the prevalence of malfeasance in their municipal government.  With similar pre-treatment measures we are able to fairly precisely measure belief updating.  In addition, we have subjects in control who are targeted with a placebo video treatment.  "
