abstract: "Globalization has increased the diversity of goods, the numbers of competitors for goods and services, the set of job opportunities, as well as the amount of available knowledge with the potential to create new research opportunities and to stimulate innovation. This comes at the cost of having to acquire and process this decentralized information to make an optimal decision. At the same time, the available time for consideration of each offer is limited. In this study, we investigate (i) how time pressure influences sequential search processes and (ii) whether people forgo material benefits through insufficient search to avoid feelings of self-blame in case the additional search was not fortunate. In a 2x2 design, we modify the available time for making the decision on the on hand, and the informational structure on the other hand. We use a sequential search task in a laboratory setting to explore how time pressure and regret contribute to the common finding that subjects fail to achieve optimal outcomes in sequential decisions.
