abstract: "Investing in the early years is a cost-effective public policy. Evidence indicates that developing key socio-emotional skills is instrumental in the acquisition of cognitive and academic skills and that these skills can be developed through psychological interventions. To test this at scale, we conduct a randomized experiment in Mexico to test if a mindfulness-based curriculum can help to improve the socio-emotional and cognitive skills of preschool children. Teachers from all 111 preschools in Nuevo Leon participated in the study, half of them were randomly selected to be trained to implement the curriculum and the other half was randomly assigned to a comparison group. As a potential mechanism, we test the indirect impacts of the intervention on teacher's socioemotional skills and psychological wellbeing. "
