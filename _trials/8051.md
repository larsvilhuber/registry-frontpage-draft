abstract: "Kartu Prakerja is a novel Government of Indonesia program that combines vocational training with cash transfers, using a web-based platform and digital G2P (government-to-person) payments, to develop work skills, promote employment, sustain families, and promote digital financial inclusion. Launched in early 2020, it is a key component of Indonesia’s social protection policy, with millions already enrolled. We leverage Kartu Prakerja’s lottery enrollment system, national sample surveys, and new surveys to rigorously evaluate program effects on labor, consumption smoothing, and financial behaviors. We focus on comparing eligible applicants in 2020 and 2021 randomly selected to receive the program (treatment) to those not randomly selected (control). We additionally explore take-up of the program in terms of the types of applicants that benefit from the program. "
