abstract: "The rise in the use of social media applications has dramatically increased the time spent on cell phones especially among the educated youth. Whereas the widespread ownership of mobile phone devices presents unique opportunities for the design of educational experience, and has created a lot of interest in newer models of imparting education, the life of a typical university student still predominantly revolves around attending lectures and taking exams. In such a setting, use of mobile phones in class could potentially have an adverse effect by drawing student attention away from learning. This research aims to carefully measure whether having access to a cell phone during class impacts student learning outcomes.

In this study, we aim to carefully measure the impact, if any, from studentsâ€™ use of cell phone in the classroom using a randomized experiment. One of the questions we want to answer carefully is the extent to which use of a cell phone in class affects learning as measured by test scores. In addition, we want to collect data on intermediate outcomes of interest: class attendance and student engagement with class. Therefore, our primary outcome of interest is test scores while the secondary outcome variables are attendance and classroom activity."
