abstract: "We test the effect of a recent experience of time scarcity on financial decisions, examining the role of left-digit bias. Our main hypothesis is that people who recently experienced time scarcity are exhausted. This makes them more prone to rely on mental shortcuts, and thus exhibit a higher degree of left-digit bias. We test this hypothesis in a laboratory study with economics and finance college students in Peru."
