abstract: "Abstract: Economic and financial models predict that expected returns in the stock market will influence investment decisions. Those who expect that there will be low returns should allocate less money to equities and put more money in guaranteed return investments. Economists and psychologists have used many different methods to elicit expectations about the distribution of future economic outcomes, such as inflation and stock market returns. In this research we seek to assess which methods of eliciting expectations best reflect participantsâ€™ investment choices."
