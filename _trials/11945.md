abstract: "Violence and the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela has led nearly two million Venezuelans to flee to Colombia (USAID 2020). Despite the growing efforts of the Colombian government to provide support, forcibly displaced and migrant populations continue to face various legal, economic, and social barriers.  One of the many barriers relates to limited internet access which reduces the amount of information that the financially constrained migrants can obtain about government programs or economic opportunities, as well as limits their ability to expand or sustain their social ties. We assess the effects of enhanced data access (by providing mobile data credits) on migrants’ knowledge and interest about the existing migrant assistance programs, on the expansion and sustainment of their social networks, and on their levels of psychological wellbeing. Our design also allows us to test whether complementing enhanced data access with access to moderated WhatsApp groups which provide both legitimate information leads to better socio-economic outcomes for this community. Finally, we provide evidence of how levels of digital literacy within this community – captured through a novel set of literacy measures – shapes the effects of this intervention and the challenges related to migrant integration and wellbeing."
