abstract: "Objectives. To evaluate a community-informed mobile phone intervention (mivacunaLA/myshotLA) to increase COVID-19 vaccination among Latino families in communities with low vaccine uptake and high rates of COVID-19 transmission.
Methods. We conducted a randomized controlled trial with a wait-list control group among Latino parents/caregivers with at least one unvaccinated child in East and South Los Angeles in the fall of 2022 to measure the effectiveness of mivacunaLA, a community-partnered intervention to promote vaccine uptake by addressing misinformation and building trust.
Results. Analysis in progress. We plan analyze the impact of our program on COVID-19 vaccine uptake among children in 3 age groups: 1) 6 months to 4 years old, 2) 5 to 11 years old, and 3) 12 to 17 years old.
