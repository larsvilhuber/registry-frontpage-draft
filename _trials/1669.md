abstract: "Publications in top scientific journals play a critical role in the careers of scientists. Yet, remarkably little is known about how editors choose which submissions to publish. We provide evidence on this decision-making process using anonymized data on all submissions over eight years to four leading economics journals: the Journal of the European Economics Association, the Quarterly Journal of Economics, the Review of Economic Studies, and the Review of Economics and Statistics. The data set contains information on characteristics of the papers (and their authors), referee recommendations, and the editorial decision. The manuscripts are matched to Google Scholar citations. We compare the findings in the four journals to the predictions of a simple descriptive model in which editors aim to maximize the citations of published articles. To gather some additional insights, we conduct a survey of faculty and PhD students in economics, asking them to compare pairs of papers in their field of expertise. This survey is the focus of this pre-registration. The pairs of papers evaluated in the survey are selected so both papers are in the same field and both were published in a top journal in the same year between 1999 and 2012. We ask the respondents to compare papers on four features: novelty, exposition, rigor, and importance of contribution. We also provide respondents with the actual Google Scholar citations for the paper and ask them about what they think would be the appropriate citations, given their judgment. This additional evaluation us to return to alternative interpretations for the findings on editorial choices."
