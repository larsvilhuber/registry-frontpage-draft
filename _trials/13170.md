abstract: "We plan on running an RCT in the field during the spring of 2024 with a representative sample of residents in the Oslo area (capital of Norway). We will investigate individual mobility and transport modes using surveys and an app tracking mobility. In particular we are interested in study the impact of road pricing (first best price differentiated on time and space for car driving) on travel behavior and on acceptability for such policies."
