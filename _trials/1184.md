abstract: "Mozambique has a high child mortality rate, with a substantial portion of these deaths stemming from vaccine-preventable diseases.  A key issue is the drop-off between the first and subsequent doses of a vaccine.  This evaluation tests a mobile phone-based application introduced to health facility technicians in the Ministry of Health's national Extended Program of Immunization (EPI).  The application is intended to (a) improve the EPI's management of vaccine stock and (b) automatically remind caregivers of upcoming vaccination appointments.  The evaluation examines the impact of the intervention on child vaccination rates and management of the vaccine supply chain."
