abstract: "We study how to explain peer information to encourage people to have a strong intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Prior research has shown that introducing that many people have the intention to receive the vaccine can strengthen the vaccination intention of other people. However, if such the introduction inhibits their autonomous decision-making, it may be a sludge rather than a nudge. Thus, it is important from a policy perspective to clarify the way to explain peer information that can strengthen peopleâ€™s vaccination intention but at the same time does not inhibit their autonomous decision-making.

We conduct an online survey experiment toward 1,600 respondents of young people (25-34 years old) and elderly people (65-74 years old) residing throughout Japan. We randomly divide the survey respondents into four groups. We set in the survey a hypothetical question to capture their willingness-to pay (WTP) for the COVID-19 vaccine, while displaying messages by group. The four groups consist of three treatment groups, which explain the peer information in different ways, and one control group. After the hypothetical question, we set questions to capture the degrees of autonomous decision-making. We use the experimental data and estimate the effects of the three treatments on the WTP and the autonomous degrees. We also investigate whether the effects are heterogeneous by socio-economic attributes, psychological and behavioral economic characteristics, health status, infection prevention attitudes and behaviors, etc.

At the end of the survey, we explain to the respondents that we have conducted a randomized controlled trial in the survey and its contents and purpose. We then ask them if they would like to change their choice regarding whether or not to receive the vaccine. We examine for each group how many respondents changed their choice."
