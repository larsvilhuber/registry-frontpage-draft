abstract: "How can we change attitudes and behaviors towards violence? This paper analyzes how an experimental intervention at schools in Peru, aimed to change the acceptance and reporting of violence through role-playing and discussion in classrooms, can lead to a reduction of violence in schools and surroundings, having positive long-term effects on human capital and crime."
