abstract: "This document presents the pre-analysis plan of a lab-in-the-field experiment that will be conducted in Salima district of Malawi. This experiment aims at documenting a new form of time-inconsistency: parent-bias. While present-bias characterizes individuals who are over-optimistic about their willingness to allocate resources to delayed consumption in the future, parent-bias characterizes individuals who are over-optimistic about their willingness to allocate resources to their children in the future. 

We document the extent to which individuals are sophisticated, or cognizant about their preference reversals and their demand for commitment.  We investigate the extent to which framing interventions -- such as labeling consumption -- are able to mitigate parent-bias.
