abstract: "The Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) in the General Services Administration, the Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R) in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) are collaborating to develop and test an intervention to encourage residents of Federally assisted public housing developments to reduce household energy use, thereby reducing Federal expenditures on public housing utilities.

The intervention will consist of mailing a series of flyers at 2-week intervals during August and September of 2018. Each flyer will feature descriptive feedback on energy use, a comparison to other NYCHA residents, injunctive feedback (e.g., “great, good, below average”), and an energy-saving tip. Additionally, some mailings will include a coloring sheet for children featuring the energy-saving tip of the week. The intervention will be printed in both English and Spanish.

Units will be individually randomized within blocks to either the intervention (treatment arm) or no letters (control arm). Blocks are created based on development and unit size. The research team will then estimate the effects of the intervention on average daily energy use (in kilowatt-hours, kWh) for units sent flyers compared to average daily energy use for units not sent flyers, as measured by Wireless Energy Modules (WEMs) in each housing unit.
