abstract: "We present a laboratory experiment that examines individualsâ€™ willingness to take advice from algorithms provided by artificial intelligence (AI). We explored two distinguished channels behind the algorithm, the data and the mechanism. In this additional experiment, we will examine individual willingness to pay for the algorithm advice using a within-subject information acquisition treatment design. We will also compare welfare effects, in terms of subject payoff, with regard to information provision and acquisition. The benchmark for comparison where no information is available is borrowed from a previously conducted RCT which we also pre-registered on this website."
