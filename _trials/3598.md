abstract: "In this study we investigate the existence of an adverse selection of liars in the labor market. We then explore its consequences on the effectiveness of voluntary truth-telling as a solution for the problem of adverse selection in a lemons market. To do so, we design an experiment where individuals choose whether to sell a product in a cheap-talk market in which they can send an arbitrary message to the buyer, or in a verifiable-message market where they can only send truthful but possibly vague messages (Selection treatment). We then compare this treatment with one where the sellers are randomly allocated between the two markets (Random treatment). Using theoretical analysis we predict that the proportion of honest sellers in the cheap-talk market in the Selection treatment is lower than that in the Random treatment. Second, there are fewer trades in the Selection treatment than in the Random treatment, implying more inefficiencies in the Selection treatment.
