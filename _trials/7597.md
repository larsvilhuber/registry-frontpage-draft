abstract: "We run a field experiment / lab in the field experiment (online) with crowdfunders. The survey part of the experiment is asking for the reasons why investors use crowdfunding, rather than alternatives such as stocks, funds etc. The survey also elicits various demographics and risk and time preferences.

In an incentivized choice experiment, we then elicit data to determine why crowdfunders in particular invest in green projects. For details, see the attached document.

Subjects are randomized into a condition that completes the experiment first, or another condition that completes the survey first."
