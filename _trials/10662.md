abstract: "Are there good mechanisms that a group of decision-makers can use to reach a joint decision on a set of alternatives? Applications range from project evaluations and committee decisions to the selection of arbitrators in conflict resolution. In practice, there is a range of mechanisms such as the highly popular Veto Rank mechanism. The related literature also proposes a number of mechanisms that are theoretically argued to be superior. In this project, we will run an experiment to compare these mechanisms in terms of efficiency and fairness, as well as how close the experimental subjects behave in relation to the equilibrium predictions."
