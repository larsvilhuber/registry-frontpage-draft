abstract: "We design an experiment to study the role of motivated reasoning in correlation neglect. Participants receive potentially redundant signals about an ego-relevant state---their IQ test performance. We elicit their belief that the signals came from the same source (and thus contain redundant information). Participants generally underappreciate the extent to which identical signals are more likely to come from the same source, but the bias is stronger for ego-favorable signals than for ego-unfavorable signals. We do not detect an asymmetric effect when the state is ego-irrelevant. Our results suggest that individuals may neglect correlation between desirable signals to sustain motivated beliefs."
