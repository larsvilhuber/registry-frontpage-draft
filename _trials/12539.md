abstract: "The Thucydides Trap theory postulates that a rising power will inevitably challenge the status of an established power, and the established power will also take measures to restrain and suppress the rising power. Conflict between the two is seen as unavoidable. We test weather future economic prospects matter. If future economic prospects are positive, both parties are more likely to engage in cooperation, whereas if prospects are negative, conflicts are more likely to arise. We use a lab experiment to test cooperation and conflict between a rising power and an established power and how future economic prospects (a growing versus a declining total pie) affect the occurrence of conflict. We further explore possible measures to avoid conflict in this background."
