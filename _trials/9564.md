abstract: "While existing literature suggests that removing information asymmetry between spouses leads to more efficient household economic decisions (Ashraf, 2009; Castilla & Walker, 2013), it is unknown whether the overall impact of revealing income information to one's spouse is positive because social pressure to redistribute one's income distorts labor supply decisions (Carranza et al., 2021). Using a randomized control trial with Cambodian garment workers, we will study the effect of removing income information asymmetry between spouses on overall household expenditures through two channels: (1) labor supply and (2) intra-household reallocation.
