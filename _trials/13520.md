abstract: "This is an online study conducted on Prolific. We will post a survey link on prolific. The survey is prepared on Qualtrics.

Individuals are recruited through Prolific.com. Participants will answer incentivized questions. The participants are parents with at least one child aged 6 to 13.

We will collect baseline information on average sleep duration, sleep quality and beliefs about their own sleep and the typical sleep in a similar population. We will then randomly expose subjects to audio information on the typical children sleep distribution, tailored to their reference group investigate the extent to which the information shifts their beliefs about optimal sleep duration and their willingness to change their sleep patterns as revealed through signing a pledge and their willingness to pay for a product that may help with sleep. 
We study the impact of a culturally tailored information intervention on beliefs regarding optimal sleep and bedtime behavior of children among a population of parents with children aged 6 to 13 years old. 

The study will investigate how randomized culturally tailored information on sleep distribution in the population may affect individualsâ€™ beliefs about children sleep duration and bedtime behavior. The subjects will be divided in seven main groups. A control group that will not receive any information. And six groups which will receive different information on the evidence on the importance of sleep for educational achievement; and on sleep duration and bedtime in a reference population."
