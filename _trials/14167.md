abstract: "When measuring perceptions, previous research has shown that an individualâ€™s own attitudes and beliefs are strongly, positively correlated with perceptions of the in-group, but negatively correlated with out-groups. Not only are there more positive correlations, perceptions are also more accurate for the in-group. While significant, these findings have been limited to a single ethnicity and political domain, and the underlying mechanisms remain unexplored. This study will replicate these finding across a range of domains and ethnicities. This study also investigates four potential mechanisms: Motivated Reasoning, Cultural Identity, Projection Bias and the Curse of Knowledge, both across perceptions of the in and out-groups. Lastly, this study will investigate the nature of inaccuracies within these perceptions, specifically whether these can be attributed to irrational inattention, identity bias or both. "
