abstract: "The study aims to examine whether perceived social discrimination alters the preferences of U.S. households. We plan to focus on several of the most important preference primitives, as indicated by prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979). Our key conjecture is that perceiving discrimination can influence individuals’ preferences that underpin their economic decisions because both direct and indirect observation of discrimination can impact psychological functioning, induce negative emotions, generate stress, impact one’s perceived social status, and reduce trust.
