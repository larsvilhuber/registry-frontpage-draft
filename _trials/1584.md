abstract: "This paper analyzes the long-term impacts of reservation of local political seats for women on childrenâ€™s learning outcomes in rural Andhra Pradesh. Using the random rotation of seats reserved for women over different election cycles, and three rounds of a panel dataset, researchers analyze the impact of exposure to political reservation during critical periods of childhood. The paper shows that the reservation policy for female leaders had the largest impact on learning outcomes of primary school children when they were exposed to reservation in utero and very early in life. These results can be explained by improved health and nutrition in utero and during the first years of life."
