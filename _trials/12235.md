abstract: "This document outlines our pre-analysis plan for a matching intervention in Jordan. In this intervention, we connect treated job-seekers to suitable vacancies in the manufacturing sector. We worked in partnership with the International Rescue Committee (IRC). Over the course of
nine months (from February 2019 until November 2019), we simultaneously collected information about job-seekers and job openings. We reached job-seekers through a combination of passive and active methods, aiming to include a similar number of Syrian refugees and Jordanian job-seekers. The programme was open to individuals who were aged between 18 and 45 years (inclusive), and who were willing to take up low-skilled wage work in the immediate future.  We provided a matching intervention to prospective employer firms; in this study, we estimate the consequences of that intervention."
