abstract: "This study provides rigorous testing of the effectiveness of a package of experiential learning tools related to groundwater management in India on mental models, norms, and behavior. The experiential learning intervention includes three main tools: 1) collective action games that allow people to experience the effect of their water use decisions on water management and to try out different rules; 2) structured community debriefings to discuss the implications of the games; and 3) crop water budgeting to facilitate participatory water resource planning. We use a collective action groundwater game developed and piloted by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and Foundation for Ecological Security (FES), in which participants choose between crops with different water consumption levels and see the effects of their decisions on water tables over multiple rounds of play. To facilitate full participation of women and men, games take place in separate groups of women and of men. The intention of the games is to create awareness and receptivity to changing water management practices. We then follow game play with a debriefing discussion with the full community. Finally, we complement game play with provision of information about technical and institutional options for more sustainable water management. Specifically, we do so by engaging with the farmers to apply a Crop Water Budgeting tool, which supports community-level discussions for development of collective cropping patterns that save water.  

The primary population of interest are farmers using groundwater in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Rajasthan states in India, where overuse of groundwater has led to falling water tables. All districts also have hard rock (confined) aquifers, such that local water extraction—or refraining from extraction—can affect local water tables. Within each state, the key selection criterion was districts and communities where Foundation for Ecological Security (FES) has an active program in commons management for at least 10 years, so that there would be community resource persons (CRPs) who could be trained to implement the experiential learning tools. 

We selected a total of 472 habitations (communities) where the interventions had not been used, stratified by the presence of surface irrigation, and randomly assigned 2/3 of the sample to treatment and 1/3 to control. To select individuals, focus group discussions (FGDs) were held all communities; among FGD members, 5 women and 5 men were randomly selected to play the game, and 3 men and 3 women randomly selected for an individual survey. In control communities, 3 men and 3 women were similarly selected for the survey; no games or debriefing took place. Baseline data collection and first round of interventions took place. 

Baseline data collection was conducted over 3 months (November 15th 2021 – 7th March 2022). The intervention was repeated in September-December 2022, and endline data collection is planned to begin on January 17, 2023. Major data sources are baseline and endline key informant interviews and focus group discussions; an individual survey of game players and game data; community debriefing discussion; crop water budgeting data; and habitation records.
