abstract: "In recent years, researchers have become increasingly interested in how an individual's beliefs impact economic decision-making. Despite emerging research, current literature has largely overlooked the role of hope when shaping individual beliefs. This study seeks to assess the impact of hope on an individual's decision-making for persistence and production in a real-effort task. In this paper, I will propose an experimental framework to investigate the impact of hope on an individual's persistence level and production in a real-effort task"
