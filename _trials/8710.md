abstract: "COVID-19 vaccine supplies to low-income countries are intermittent and subject to bottlenecks, resulting in occasional vaccine stockouts. It is unknown what the impacts of the supply interruptions are on vaccine demand. Lack of vaccine supply has a clear mechanical effect on vaccination rates - it is impossible to vaccinate without an available vaccine. However, interruptions in supply may also impact demand through other channels. Low availability may heighten vaccine demand by creating a sense of scarcity or lower vaccine demand via motivated thinking as individuals devalue goods that they cannot access (sour grapes effect) or are provided with a ready excuse to not follow through on vaccination if already reluctant (a type of narrative). We use administrative data on individual level vaccination status and quasi-experimental methods (regression discontinuity, difference-in-differences design) to evaluate the impact of exposure to interrupted vaccine supply on vaccine take-up. We complement the observational study with an experiment to investigate underlying behavioral mechanisms. In a first experiment, we exogenously vary the information individuals receive about a recent stockout to test the impact of scarcity on beliefs about vaccine efficacy and demand."
