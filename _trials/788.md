abstract: "Governments have long relied on cash transfers and vouchers as key elements of social welfare systems. Consumer theory offers predictions about the impact of such programs on wellbeing and spending behavior, but there is little real-world evidence. In this paper, we outline the pre-analysis plan for a randomized field experiment to explore the effect of welfare program design on these two key outcomes. We specifically test three design features: 1) workfare versus welfare; 2) restricted versus unrestricted vouchers; and 3) voucher messaging with a focus on spending on oneself or on others. The ten-day experiment involved 432 individuals living below the poverty line in the Kawangware settlement of Nairobi, Kenya. Each day, subjects either sorted lentils or waited in a room for benefit payments, provided as vouchers to a local grocery store. We either restricted the vouchers to certain basic food items or did not restrict them, and we also randomized voucher messaging. We outline the analysis plan of the impact of these experimental treatments on happiness, productivity, and consumption decisions."
