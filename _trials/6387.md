abstract: "A typical finding in experimental cheap talk games is overcommunication. Senders are more truthful and receivers are more credulous that game theory predicts. I test whether overcommunication is observed because people are more familiar with common interest environments where such behavior is optimal. To this end, I use an experiment to establish causality between past experience and behavior in a new environment. Subjects play repeated sender-receiver games with random rematching in two stages of 30 rounds each. My design varies two dimensions, Past and Future. Past varies whether the first stage is with aligned preferences (b=0) or with conflicting (b=2). Future varies whether the environment in the second stage changes permanently (30 rounds with b=1 on stage two) or not (20 rounds with the same bias as first stage and 10 rounds with b=1 in random order on stage two). I compare behavior in the second stage across treatments.
