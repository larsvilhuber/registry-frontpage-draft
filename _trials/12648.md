abstract: "Blood has no other synthetic alternative. Therefore, the only way to supply it is by donation, which requires motivation. Based on the literature, social pressure is one of those incentives that proved to be effective. However, this comes at the cost of disutility for donors and hiring solicitors. Text message campaigns, on the other hand, are fast, less costly, and more inclusive. Since the pressure exerted is indirect, it raises questions about its effectiveness. So, we have designed a field experiment to evaluate whether exerting social pressure via text message campaigns can motivate significantly more people to donate blood or not."
