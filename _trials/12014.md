abstract: "This proposal focuses on the nexus of two challenges for Ethiopian policy makers: the unproductive nature of smallholder farming and the rapid deterioration of natural forest stocks. We will evaluate the impacts of a community-based forestry intervention (devolving extraction rights to local communities) on (i) the modernization of farming, (ii) rural livelihoods and (iii) forest conservation. Community-based forestry is expected to have a transformative effect on smallholder farming by relaxing liquidity and risk constraints, providing key inputs for high-value agriculture, and facilitating collective action (enabling groups of farmers to benefit from economies of scale in trading, storage and transacting)."
