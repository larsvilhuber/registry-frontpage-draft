abstract: "Client-choice food pantries provide greater choice in food item selection relative to traditional food banks. However, there is a potential for the clients to select a food bundle that is nutritionally deficient. With the prevalence of lower nutritional status among the clients due to poor dietary choices, it is important that food pantry stakeholders encourage clients to make healthier diet choices. More than 30% of the food pantry client households have at least one member diagnosed with diabetes and 58% have at least one member with hypertension. Our aim is to design a cost-effective and unobtrusive method (intervention) to encourage the choice of healthier food items without restricting choice and evaluate its effectiveness/efficacy.
