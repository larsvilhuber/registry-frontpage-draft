abstract: "Theoretically, it is possible for a participant to ``hedge away'' ambiguity in a two-choice Ellsberg experiment when one choice is randomly chosen for payment. Past studies are mixed on whether participants recognize hedging opportunities. Our experiment aims to replicate and extend a previous study to determine whether individuals truly realize the hedging opportunity. We use belief elicitation to determine whether participants' beliefs indicate that choices considered hedging are from the understanding of the hedging opportunity. We also run a treatment that eliminates the hedging opportunity to provide further evidence in whether observed behavior is driven by consciously hedging away ambiguity. "
