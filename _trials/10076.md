abstract: "This experiment is part of a larger project which includes a previously registered experiment (AEARCTR-0005509). The larger project seeks to study the effect of using gender-neutral language in job advertisements on the quantity, quality (level of education and skill), and gender breakdown of the applicant pool in a widely used platform for the hiring of talent in the Tech Sector in Latin America. 

This particular experiment aims to assess the mechanisms behind the effects found in the previously registered experiment. It tests how potential job applicants' perceptions of a position or company are affected by whether a job advertisement uses gender-neutral language or not. 

The ad involves an online survey that shows ads to the alumni of the NGO Laboratoria, which provides "boot camps" to train women in Latin America to work as web developers and UX designers. All of Laboratoria's students are women and the NGO operates in 6 Latin American countries.
