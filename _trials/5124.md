abstract: "We manipulate the state of mind of subjects by priming them with financial concerns and non-financial concerns. We then test if these concerns cause subjects to more overweigh small probabilities, to more underweigh large probabilities, and to be more
loss-averse. We also test whether the effects, if exist, are mediated by change in cognition and emotion."
