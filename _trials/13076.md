abstract: "Statistics show that women’s labour force participation is low and they tend to drop out if they are married or when they have household responsibilities. Literature suggests that this could be due to biased gender norms and preferences: burden of domestic care work may fall primarily on women, men may not prefer women working, they may also be unaware of social acceptance of women working. The first question this study will explore can men’s attitude towards women working be changed, especially when women are married or when they are likely to
have household responsibilities? Women may be subject to these biased gender norms and that may lower their labour market aspirations and participation. The second question the study will explore is if men have a positive attitude for women working, does it encourage more women to work? A gender sensitization intervention will raise awareness on gender gaps and their adverse economic impacts on women. Positive role models will equip participants will tools to be more active in bringing change.   "
