abstract: "This experiment uses the Behavioral Economics and Situational Testing (BEAST) Lab at West Virginia University (WVU) and a pool of undergraduate students to test the existence of private currencies, like Bitcoin, and central bank digital currencies (CBDC), on consumer behavior in an economy. The aim of the experiment is to provide incentives to the consumer to use one of the three currencies to purchase the Good to test their currency portfolio throughout the game. First, the private currency competes with a typical fiat currency, and then the private currency competes with a CBDC. The implication for this experiment is to suggest whether a CBDC could drive out the use of private currency or if preconceived notions of government provide a disincentive to consumers to hold CBDC and allow for a preference for private currency. We hypothesize that incentives can be used to draw consumers toward using CBDC over private currency. "
