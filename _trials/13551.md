abstract: "We conduct an online experiment designed to evaluate the impact of historical exposure to well-integrated grain markets on the importance of identity in shaping behaviour in two incentivised games. Data comes from 900 participants born in two groups of prefectures in Fujian (southeast China) that differ in levels of historical market integration (high vs low) but are otherwise similar (similar history, ethnicity, religion, and national government). Group identities are experimentally primed using both artificial minimal-group (meaningless symbols) and natural groups (language), with 1/3 of the participants allocated to a control group (No Group Identity). After being primed with one of these identities and randomly matched with anonymous partners, participants play both the Trust and Money Burning games. "
