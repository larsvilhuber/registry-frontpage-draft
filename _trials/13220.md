abstract: "Equal opportunity clauses are intended to set leveled playing field for minority candidates, among others women. In this study we explore diversity in the implementation of equal opportunity clauses across academic institutions. We conduct a field experiment to test whether different formulations affect the outcomes of minority candidates, especially in the context of gender composition and level of qualifications of the pool of candidates."
