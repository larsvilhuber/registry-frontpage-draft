abstract: "This work estimates the impact of Chile Va, a science youth camp that seeks to develop personality traits and non cognitive abilities among the youth.  Students were randomly invited to participate of an intense one-week camp intending to promote social abilities and self-achievement, as well as motivation for science. The main objective is to determine whether this program can impact personality traits, non cognitive abilities, academic expectations, self-perception and the impact that this might have on life outcomes. In addition we are also interested on the impact on other margins such as the student's opinion about science and the likelihood of choosing a scientific career. Finally, we also consider the hypothesis of finding gender differential impacts.
