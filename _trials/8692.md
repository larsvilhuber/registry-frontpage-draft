abstract: "The present research aims to explore the role social distance plays in facilitating trust among customers of a major online retailer. In the context of online shopping, potential customers can not physically inspect the products they want to buy and they largely rely on the product reviews left by previous buyers for the first-hand insights on the product quality, suitability and decide whether the products are worth buying etc. However, product reviews, regardless how positive they are, will need to be trustworthy in the eyes of the potential buyers to have any effect given that 'fictitious product reviews' are now a wide-spread phenomenon in the competitive e-commerce business. In this setting, we explore whether a key social distance-reducing measure, that is showing the product reviewers' face photo, would enhance the trust between the potential buyer and the past buyer such that the positive reviews left by the past buyer would be more trustworthy and subsequently lead to more sales. The key research question is that, given the first 20 product reviews in the review section of a particular product are positive, would showing the review writers' face image enhance the trustworthiness of the positive reviews and encourage more potential customers to click the 'buy' button after being exposed to the reviews?"
