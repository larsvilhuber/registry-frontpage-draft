abstract: "Despite improvements in financial inclusion, many small firms in developing countries remain capital-constrained, and conventional microcredit has had limited success in improving firm profitability and growth (Banerjee et al, 2016, 2019). Financing has typically been extended in the form of loans with rigid repayment plans and stark consequences for default. In this project, we aim to test the effects of a promising alternative to debt contracts: Equity Financing. We work with a microfinance institution (MFI) to design equity contracts in which clients are provided with a productive asset (a set of goats) and split the proceeds of the sale of the asset (i.e. the difference between the sale price of the fattened goats and their purchase price) at a fixed rate with the MFI. We market this product to livestock farmers alongside a flexible debt contract whose payment structure matches the assetâ€™s production timeline (i.e. due on the sale date of the goats). To date, access to equity financing has typically been restricted to large, audited firms, and research outside of these contexts is scarce outside of a small-scale pilot (de Mel et al. 2018).  Relative to the debt-financing status quo, expanding equity finance to small-scale entrepreneurs could affect both the type of client that participates in the formal financial market (selection effects), as well as their outcomes conditional on participation (contract effects). Our experiment aims to test both the financial inclusion effects of a substantive departure in contract structure, as well as the potential effects on client and bank outcomes of the contract relative to a best-practice alternative (flexible credit) as well as a pure control group.
