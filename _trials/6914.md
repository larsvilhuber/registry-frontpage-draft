abstract: "In Madagascar, more than 80 percent of students are not mastering minimum proficiency of language and mathematics, according to PASEC (2017). This study investigates the impact of a package of intervention on (i) collaboration among parents, teachers and community members to improve student learning, and (ii) student learning in basic reading and math, through randomized controlled trial. The package of interventions aims at improving the functionality of school management committees (SMCs) to lead and facilitate community-wide collaboration at school-level. Then, through the process of information-sharing and discussion at the community general assembly, parents, teachers and community members commit themselves to organizing remedial activities on basic reading and math.

The package of interventions is called "Paquet Minimum Axé sur la Qualité” (minimum package for quality learning) that is originally developed in the Ecole pour tous project in Niger with a technical cooperation by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The package is adapted to the context of Madagascar, and combined with a method "Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL)" developed by Indian NGO "Pratham."  

The package includes different elements of interventions: (1) institutional intervention (training on democratic establishment of SMC); (2) information-sharing intervention (training on school action plan development addressing learning); and (3) pedagogical intervention (training on remedial activities of basic reading and math, and provision of math workbooks).  The content of training (3) above is "Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL)" developed by Indian NGO "Pratham, and facilitation skills of organizing remedial activity using math workbook developed by JICA.
