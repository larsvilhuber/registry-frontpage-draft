abstract: "Legal norms can affect individual behavior in multiple ways. Most straightforwardly, they can restrict individual freedom of choice by prohibitions. However, they may also have an impact by signaling what should generally be considered right or wrong, or else, common or uncommon behavior. In this paper, we exploit the recent introduction of the so-called Supply Chain Act in Germany to explore the relevance of the latter channel in the domain of social sustainability. In an online survey among a widely representative sample of about 1,000 individuals in Germany, we examine the expressive effect of information about the German Supply Chain Act on individuals’ willingness to pay for sustainably produced socks that are not directly covered by the law. The willingness to pay is measured via an incentivized consumption decision experiment in which respondents must choose between different sock alternatives in a multiple price list. Finally, we measure subjects’ personal injunctive norm, perceived social injunctive norm, perceived social descriptive norm, as well as subjects’ beliefs on sustainable consumption, which gives us the opportunity to examine whether treatment effects may be attributable to a change in these norms or beliefs.
