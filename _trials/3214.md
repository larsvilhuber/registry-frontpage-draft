abstract: "Female-owned enterprises have the potential to spur inclusive growth and contribute to eco- nomic empowerment in settings where women have been traditionally marginalized, but current evidence finds puzzlingly low returns to both financial and human capital interventions. This project aims at understanding whether a holistic entrepreneurship program that tackles multiple growth constraints simultaneously can promote business growth and its consequences for household dynamics. We estimate the growth impacts of an entrepreneurship program specifically designed for low education participants on business outcomes as well as the importance of additional mentor- ing visits, and the scalability of the program through implementation partners. Our experimental design allows us to estimate spillover effects of the treatment through a partial phase-in of the intervention and detailed network data on the village level.
This study furthermore provides novel evidence on the impact of women-focused entrepreneur- ship programs on household bargaining power of women and household consumption, and treat- ment effects on participantsâ€™ children. We study intergenerational spillovers of the intervention as a key channel for long-term effects. In addition to creating income for participants, the program raises self-confidence and aspirations, and increases forward-looking behavior. Recent experimen- tal evidence points towards the importance of positive role models for children. Therefore, we believe that participating in the program may translate into attitudinal and behavioral changes for children in their social networks that go beyond income effects."
