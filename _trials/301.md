abstract: "Indigenous children often have low literacy levels and limited understanding of the language of school instruction upon school entry. This study uses a three-arm randomized field trial to test two versions of a three-year intervention implemented by an NGO, Save the Children, aimed at developing specific literacy and pre-literacy skills and promoting a culture of reading in the home and community for indigenous populations. The intervention is known as Leer Juntos, Aprender Juntos (Read Together, Learn Together) and is based on Literacy Boost, previously developed by Save the Children and implemented in other countries. 

The basic intervention is an in-school intervention, focusing on teacher training and coaching. 

The enhanced intervention also includes a community action component, which uses community volunteers to help organize reading camps, reading buddy programs, and the creation of mother-tongue reading materials to populate mobile libraries. 

The third treatment arm is the traditional approach to teacher training and community involvement and is operated by the local ministry of education."
