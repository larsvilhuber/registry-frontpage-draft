abstract: "STUDY QUESTION: Can growth hormone (GH) improve the chance of pregnancy and birth in women with repeated implantation failure (RIF) with donated oocytes?
SUMMARY ANSWER: In the context of RIF (defined as 2 failed oocyte donation attempts in this study), the administration of GH improved significantly the pregnancy and live birth rates with donated oocytes, although these success rates remained lower as compared with first-attempt oocyte donation cycles. Additionally, GH improved significantly endometrial thickness in women with RIF.  
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Despite high success rates with oocyte donation, certain couples experience unexplained RIF with this approach. GH improves uterine receptivity in cows.          
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This was a randomized study conducted between 2010 and 2015 and comparing success rates of oocyte donation in 35 RIF patients with GH and in 35 RIF patients without GH. Results were compared with those of 35 first-attempt oocyte donation cycles (positive control).          
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The maximum age of oocyte donors was 25 years. The age of women receiving embryos from this program (oocyte recipients) was comprised between 30 and 51 years. Oocyte donors were stimulated with the use of a long GnRH agonist protocol. Oocyte recipients were treated with progressively increasing doses of oral estradiol after previous pituitary desensitization. IVF was performed by ICSI in all cases included in this study.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The RIF patient group receiving GH administration demonstrated significantly thicker endometrium, and higher success rates when compared to the non-GH patient group (negative control), although still lower as compared to patients undergoing their first oocyte donation attempt (positive controls). The inclusion of the negative and positive control groups reduces the role of chance in these observations.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The sample size in this study was sufficient to interpret adequtely the results. However, it has to be stressed that the effects of GH were studied in a very particular category of patients (RIF with oocyte donation). Hence, these observations are not applicable to most patients treated by oocyte donation. On the other hand, these results offer a new chance to patients suffering from RIF in oocyte donation programs.	 
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our study shows that there is a group of women with a problem of endometrial receptivity, independent of oocyte and embryo quality. GH can be useful to alleviate this condition. Even though these results were obtained in an oocyte donation program, the same problem may occur in any woman treated by IVF with her own oocytes. Further research is needed to identify patients who could benefit from getting GH treatment, independently of age and oocyte quality.
