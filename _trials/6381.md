abstract: "Colombian schools have been closed since March 15, 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, causing concerns over the potential widening of the already large academic gaps between students from different socio-economic strata. We suggest an intervention aimed at narrowing these gaps by assigning online high school students as tutors to fifth graders from more disadvantaged backgrounds. Our intervention consists of two different components. First, we plan to evaluate the impact of tutoring on both academic outcomes, as well as non-cognitive ones for the tutees. Second, we will evaluate whether exposure to peers from lower-economic strata impacts the tutors views on poverty and redistribution of income.
