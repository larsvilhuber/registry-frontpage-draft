abstract: "In our everyday lives, we often tend to conform to the opinions and decisions of others. A potential reason may be that we are afraid of how we will be perceived by others if we make a decision contrary to the majority and no longer be seen as part of the community. Are we more inclined to agree with the decision of others when our own decision can be associated to us? 
To answer these question, we investigate the influence of public disclosure and identity revelation of one's own decision on conformity behavior. We conduct a lab experiment to explore whether individuals are more prone to follow the decisions of others when their own choices are subsequently made public."
