abstract: "This experiment is designed to test whether investors pay more attention to good news about a stock than to bad news.  We will recruit individuals who have been invested in at least one individual stock for at least 6 months.  In an initial survey, we will ask them for the name of the stock with the greatest total valuation of shares that they have been holding for at least 6 months.  Then, we will send them an email giving them information about their stock's performance over the last 6 months.  Finally, we will send out a survey asking them to recall information that they received in the email about their stock's performance.  Our prediction is that they will be more likely to recall information when their stock went up, or went up relative to the S&P."
