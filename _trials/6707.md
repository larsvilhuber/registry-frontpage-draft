abstract: "Manufacturing Connect_Lanchashire (MC_L) is a new initiative designed to aid SMEs in gaining a better understanding of performance-enhancing digital business technologies.  It is funded as part of the Business Basics 3 programme by Innovate UK/BEIS.  The work will explore with SME participants the ways in which digital technologies can make measurable improvements to business performance, and aid participants in tackling the common pitfalls experienced during technology adoption/implementation.  The project was awarded to a consortium comprising Edge Hill University (lead), Advance Manufacturing Research Centre and Manchester Metropolitan University in May 2020.  Work commenced in June 2020 and will run until February 2022."
