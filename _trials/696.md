abstract: "This study presents the pre-analysis plan of a randomized intervention aimed at evaluating the impact of a tablet-based financial education intervention in Colombia. The evaluation will test the impact of the intervention on financial literacy (including skills, awareness, attitudes and perceptions), personal financial practice adoption (e.g., savings, budget, debt behavior, etc.), and use of formal financial products (e.g., kind and number of formal financial transactions) on poor and extremely poor mostly female participants of the Colombian "Más Familias en Acción" CCT Program.
