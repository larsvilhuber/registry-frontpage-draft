abstract: "Recent years have witnessed renewed appreciation that agriculture could play a significant role in the pursuit of Millennium Development Goals. In this context, the role of information dissemination through information and communication technology (ICT) in improving rural welfare is highlighted. However, some fear that with ICT technological disparity will arise, and existing socio-economic inequality and poverty will be further exacerbated. This study will use randomized experiment and surveys before and after the experiment to investigate the knowledge exchange impact of ICT on rural welfare in the Indian state of Karnataka. The randomized experiment or the action research proposed here involves facilitating information access on several essential services to households in some villages and not in others. Combining data from both surveys and the experiment, we investigate the knowledge exchange impact of information dissemination on household incomes, social network, risk coping mechanism and caste disparity."
