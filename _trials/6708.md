abstract: "Childcare services have important long-term effects on children's human capital. Access to affordable childcare services likely has important financial implications for low- and middle-income families and can contribute to the reduction of achievement gaps, and promote female labor participation. For these reasons, state, local, and federal programs typically provide subsidized childcare via a menu of options that include free Head Start programs, various voucher schemes to pay for private care, and free pre-k programs that are the entry-way to public elementary schools in many school district across the country.
 
Overall, low to middle-income families may qualify for a number of subsidized childcare and early education options, but they may also struggle to know what is available and if they meet the various criteria for eligibility. Moreover, families that qualify for multiple programs may find it challenging to find the most cost-effective option available.

Covid-19 has likely amplified this information frictions. Care facilities may have closed temporarily or permanently, leaving families in search of care. At the same time, families that face important reductions in their income may now qualify for programs they did not qualify for before. All these, while childcare centers may be struggling to find users to prevent closures.

This project will study the childcare landscape in Connecticut and aims to understand a) what childcare and early education options and subsidy programs did families in this state utilize before the COVID pandemic, b) what information do parents have about available care options, and subsidy programs and their eligibility criteria, c) what are the main barriers that families perceive in the access to childcare services, and finally d) what is the effect of an information intervention about childcare options on parental demand of childcare services, and the utilization of the different options available.
