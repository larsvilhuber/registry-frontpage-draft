abstract: "Single-use plastics are a ubiquitous and continuous threat to the environmentâ€”especially single-use plastic bags from everyday shopping, which people throw away after use. About 5 trillion plastic bags are used yearly worldwide, and this consumption is primarily attributed to consumer behavior. Unlike plastic food packaging, consumers can choose whether or not to use plastic bags to carry their goods from the shop to home. Through two pilot field experiments, we will test the efficacy of behavioral nudges to reduce plastic bag use among retail consumers in a developing country context. We hypothesize that consumer behavior changes towards reduced plastic bag consumption through changes in the shopping environment and giving a mild reminder to the consumers. 

The first pilot experiment tests different choice conditions, where consumers shopping at a shop are asked to choose whether or not to use a plastic bag in different ways. We will create three treatment conditions and control through cluster randomization where each shop in the retail market is the unit of randomization. In the second experiment, we will test the efficacy of reminder messages written on a shopping voucher card. Another treatment arm will combine these messages with the endowment of reusable bags. Unlike the first experiment, treatment will be randomized at the individual consumer level. We expect a 15-20 percent reduction in plastic bag use among retail consumers after the end of the experiment. "
