abstract: "This paper considers harm reduction for conservation: promoting a product that attracts and reduces harm from an inframarginal consumer unmoved by calls for abstinence. We analyze residential water use, where lawn removal is favored by policymakers but is unappealing to heavy irrigators' aesthetic preferences. Using sequential field experiments, we show that a smart irrigation controller that efficiently maintains stigmatized ornamental landscapes appeals to the heaviest irrigators and generates large and long-lasting individual and social benefits: cost recovery in six months and water savings covering another household's basic needs. We find no evidence it cannibalizes abstinence (lawn removal)."
