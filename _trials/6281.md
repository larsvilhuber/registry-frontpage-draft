abstract: "To examine if the competition in the labour market can reduce taste-based ethnic discrimination during the hiring process, we will use a lab experiment to stimulate the hiring process. In this study, we are interested in the effect of output competition on ethnic discrimination during the hiring process. The main experiment is a hiring game with 2x2 treatments. In each session, participants will play a role as employers and they are required to hire one of the candidates as their employees and form a group. The 2x2 treatments differ by 1) whether the ethic information of employee candidates is given 2) whether they have an output competition with the other groups. Employers payments will depend on their employee's performance and the rankings under the treatments with output competition. Through this experiment, we expect to capture the effects of output competition on taste-based ethnic discrimination.
