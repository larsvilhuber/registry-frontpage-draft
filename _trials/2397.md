abstract: "Illegal activity is widespread around the world. Local authorities probably observe illegal
activity with a large footprint, but decide not report to the National government. To overcome the
challenge of measuring illegal mining, we constructed a novel dataset using machine learning
predictions on satellite imagery features. In this research proposal we outline how we plan to
disclose this information to the authorities to address three research questions: Does revealing
the existence of illegal activity reduces the extent of the activity?; Does the agent informed
matters for the effect?; Does illegal activity relocate to neighboring municipalities not treated?"
