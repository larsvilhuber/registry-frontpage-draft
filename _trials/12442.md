abstract: "Adoption of improved sweetpotato varieties (ISVs), particularly certified sweetpotato vines that are free from harmful pests and diseases, is disappointingly slow in sub-Saharan Africa. In Uganda, the national adoption of ISVs stands at 12% despite decades of investments in their promotion. The underlying factors could be many, including lack of awareness and knowledge about how to use the ISV, uncertainty about performance and quality attributes of ISVs, a preference for local disease and pest-infected varieties, and difficulty accessing the ISVs when needed. In recent years, researchers have explored the use of nudges to promote behavior change. In this study, we will piggyback on on-going RCT that tests the role behavioral interventions relating to nostalgia, loss aversion, and mobile phone-based text message reminders  in nudging farmers to shift from using local varieties to ISVs. In the current RCT, we specifically assess the role of providing a small seed pack or “trial pack” to farmers combined with consumer intervention in form cooking and tasting the roots of the ISVs in enhancing the adoption of improved varieties. We hypothesize that behavioral nudges combined with these second-round interventions will motivate farmers to shift from using low-yielding disease and pest-infected varieties to purchased ISVs by purchasing the latter from a designated salespoints conveniently located in their neighborhoods. We also hypothesize that providing a trial pack and the consumer intervention lowers the uncertainty about agronomic performance and taste of improved varieties enhancing their adoption. To test these hypotheses, we will implement a cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Uganda involving 120 villages (clusters), with  960 households (i.e., 8 households/village) randomly selected for tracking the effects. The second round of interventions will be rolled out in the last season of the original nudge RCT that spans four consecutive sweetpotato growing seasons (i.e., two years). It will run for one year (two seasons) from June 2023 to June 2024 with baseline and end endline data collection in June-July 2023 and July 2024.  "
