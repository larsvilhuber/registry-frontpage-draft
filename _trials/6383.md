abstract: "The Goodwill Excel Center in Austin, Texas is a tuition-free public charter school that provides adults 18 to 50 the resources, guidance, and instruction to earn a high school diploma. In addition to their accelerated program towards completing high school, the Excel Center offers free on-site childcare, transportation vouchers, flexible scheduling options, and opportunities to earn industry-recognized certificates and/or college credits towards degrees at local colleges and universities. With a completion rate of 28 percent, the Excel Center is interested in improving program persistence. To do so, the Excel Center is establishing a new Career and College Readiness Coach (CCRC), as well as a goal-setting intervention followed by daily text message reminders to students. Partnering with the Wilson Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunities (LEO), the Excel Center is interested in evaluating the effectiveness of these interventions towards improving outcomes like completion rates, employment and earnings, and post-secondary enrollment and completion."
