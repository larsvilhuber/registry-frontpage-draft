abstract: "The earthquake hazard map of Italy has been examined by seismologists and volcanologists to identify areas with a comparable probability of a building collapse within the next 50 years. This probability is derived by multiplying the PGA (Peak Ground Acceleration) at an exceedance probability of 10% with the classic fragility curve. The estimated probability of collapse in the next 50 years in these locations is 10%. This objective probability will be compared with the perceived probability of the interviewees. All interviewees reside in a seismic area and share the same objective probability (10%) of experiencing a house collapse in the next 50 years. 
The study aims to determine the between the objective risk and the perceived risk. It also seeks to compare the self-reported and other-reported likelihood of a house collapsing. We hypothesize that the probability reported for others is higher than the self-reported probability, whether those others are neighbors from the same city or citizens from another region's city [p(others) > p(self)]. This hypothesis suggests a form of optimism bias.
