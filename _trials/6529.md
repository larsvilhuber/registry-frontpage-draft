abstract: "One important tool for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic lies in fast and effective detection of individuals who have been in close contact with infected persons. In this context, contact tracing apps such as the German "Corona-Warn-App" (CWA) can play an important role. 
Installation and use of the contact tracing app represents a public good: everyone, even those who do not install an app, benefits from faster tracking of suspicious cases. Yet, take-up rate of the CWA remained at only slightly about 20 percent of German population even three months after roll-out. One potential channel to increase the willingness to contribute may be to emphasize the benefits for peers in the immediate social environment, since individuals often behave more prosocially in groups they personally identify with. Controlled laboratory studies further show that social comparison between different groups can lead to greater cooperation in the provision of public goods. However, there has been little empirical research in field setting so far. 

In this project, we investigate whether and how targeted feedback on local COVID-19 incidence rates and social comparisons with other regions can increase the willingness to install the CWA. We test this on a large-scale through targeted social media ads. Additional online surveys aim to further inform us about the relevant behavioral mechanisms of the intervention."
