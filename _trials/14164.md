abstract: "This research seeks to understand whether and how people's expectations about the international relations affect their expectations about the macroeconomy and personal behavior. The literature thus far has been exclusively focusing on how various domestic factors influence the  expectations about the macroeconomy. To do so, we plan to conduct a survey experiment in which we provide different expert forecasts, regarding the probability of war between the U.S. and China over the next decade, to responders and assess whether the intervention changes their views on the U.S.-China relation and most importantly their expectations about the U.S. macroeconomy (including unemployment, inflation, stock performance, likelihood of recession, trade with China). We also ask about respondents' expectations about their own employment, saving, investing, and purchasing behavior. "
