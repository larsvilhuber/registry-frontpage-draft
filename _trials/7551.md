abstract: "Matching markets intend to form mutually beneficial stable relationships. The stability criterion guarantees that no participant can benefit from breaking up a formed match. Under the deferred acceptance mechanism (DA), matches ought to be stable. This result builds on the assumptions of strict and invariable preference orders under complete information. Empirical evidence on whether preferences actually meet these assumptions is lacking. In a theory-guided laboratory experiment, we test whether agents have reciprocating preferences. We hypothesize that agents prefer to interact with someone who prefers interacting with them. Hence, agents adjust their own preference ranking once they know how other participants ranked them. We document how this affects the stability of the DA, investigate subsequent cooperation behavior in the formed teams and discriminate between belief-based and preference-based explanation for preference changes. This contributes to the literature on the design and robustness of (centralized) matching markets."
