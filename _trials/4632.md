abstract: "This project will address the extent to which student supports can improve completion outcomes for nontraditional students, in this case, those who have previously been unsuccessful in college and are entering early adulthood. The intervention – college re-entry coaching and counseling provided by InsideTrack – will identify the reasons why participants were unsuccessful in their prior enrollment and connect them with resources and support to help overcome these challenges. The population studied will be former California State University (CSU) and California Community College (CCC) students, identified through a partnership with the California Student Aid Commission (CSAC)."
