abstract: "This correspondence study will evaluate the nature of labor market discrimination of the indigenous population of a Latin American country. Previous correspondence studies in the same country found that the callback rate for white men and women applying to jobs was significantly higher than that of indigenous men and women, with the largest gap existing between white men and indigenous women (Galarza and Yamada, 2014). To further assess the level of statistical discrimination compared to taste-based discrimination present in this country's labor market, the study will test a nationwide education initiative's effectiveness as a signal of high aptitude and competency when participation in said program is placed on a CV.  We will do this by sending four fictitious CVs to each vacancy job postings in urban areas of the country. We will randomly assign the signaling of aptitude and competency via education program participation to candidates. "
