abstract: "Research on organizationsâ€™ decisions to adopt evidence-based programs exclusively draws upon self-selected samples. Consequently, research may have overlooked any first-order barriers to program adoption. Using four embedded natural field experiments in a random sample of all public schools in Denmark (N=368), we find that capturing the attention of decision-makers increases the adoption rate of an evidence-based book-reading program from 20\% to 70\%. We replicate the result in a second random sample. Once decision-makers pay attention, their primary interest is the immediate transaction costs, and not---as usually expected---evidence about the long-term benefits of the program. "
