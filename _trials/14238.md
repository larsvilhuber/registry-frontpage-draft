abstract: "Economic theory suggests that a utility function can rationalize consumer behavior. Previous research has found no effect of alcohol consumption, circadian mismatching, cognitive load, and physical stress on economic rationality. To the best of my knowledge, no previous study has examined how emotional load and regulation can affect economic rationality. I plan to conduct an online economic experiment and exogenously vary emotional load to assess the effect of bad news on economic rationality. "
