abstract: "In recent years, individuals began producing air quality data (AQD) by purchasing and using air quality sensors. At a low cost to adopters, this personalized, real-time AQD can inform individual decision-making (e.g. air pollution responses) and contribute to publicly available pollution maps. Recent research shows that socioeconomic status predicts air quality sensor adoption, potentially exacerbating existing spatial inequalities in AQD and health damages from air pollution. However, willingness to pay for this technology and its usage patterns are not yet well understood, in particular among different socioeconomic groups. We conduct a field experiment in a socioeconomically heterogeneous, high pollution setting in the United States to evaluate the adoption and use of low-cost air quality sensors. "
