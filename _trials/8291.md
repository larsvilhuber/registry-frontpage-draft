abstract: "We will run an  experimental study on redistribution preferences in the presence of wage discretion. In the experiment participants decide how to split a bonus between two workers who did the same task. First, participants are presented a preliminary split of the bonus made prior to the study. For the treatment group, one of the workers within the pair has determined the earning split, while for the control group, a disinterested third party made the decision. By construction, the distribution of performances and preliminary earnings will be identical across the two groups. Thus, the difference between choices made by the control and treatment group can only be attributed to the difference in the process of deciding the preliminary split of the bonus. We want to test whether the workers' opportunity to suggest their own wage share changes spectators' distribution choices."
