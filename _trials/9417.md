abstract: "In Kananga, Democratic Republic of Congo, use of traditional medicine is high and illness is often explained through witchcraft and other supernatural forces. I design a field experiment to study whether explaining the origin and treatment possibilities of an exemplifying disease can alter the classification of diseases into supernatural and natural diseases, affect beliefs about modern medicine efficacy, and ultimately increase demand for modern medicine. 

Specifically, I examine whether informational videos on epilepsy can induce 
1)	belief updating regarding the origin and modern medicine treatment efficacy of epilepsy and demand for modern treatment for epilepsy and
2)	spillover effects on other diseases: updating beliefs about their origin, modern treatment efficacy, and demand for modern medicine. 
Epilepsy is highly prevalent and salient and the disease most frequently explained through witchcraft in Kananga.
