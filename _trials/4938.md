abstract: "This project aims to study the impact that financial literacy, enhanced through financial education, might have in mitigating the emergence of asset price bubbles. To this aim, we run a laboratory experiment with high school students who have taken part in a randomized control trial designed to test the effectiveness of a course in financial education in Tirana, Albania.
The experiment will involve two groups of students. The first group, referred to as the treated group, is composed of students who took the financial education course for one entire academic year. The second group (control), is composed of students who did not take such a course.
Students from both groups will be asked to trade against each other in a virtual trading platform. To measure the occurrence of an asset price bubble, we will replicate the design of Lei et al. (2001), based on Smith et al. (1988). The students will trade over a sequence of 15 trading periods, with fixed roles of buyers and sellers, so to avoid any speculative motive. Before trading, subjects will have information on the dividend distribution and will be informed whether their counterparts have also taken the course in financial education or not.
We hypothesize that students who were exposed to the financial education course will be less prone to give rise to financial bubbles and that bubbles will be less frequent and smaller in magnitude when treated students interact with each other, than when they interact with non-treated students.  "
