abstract: "This study aims to measure the impact of after-school clubs (a version of the After-School programs) on measures of violence and vulnerability of students in schools in a developing country, for which there is little evidence of the impact this such interventions. The premise is that clubs improve social skills of children and their ability to handle conflicts, which also allows them to improve their protection factors and their academic performance. This research is relevant to the context in which the clubs are developed: schools located in risky communities in El Salvador, a country with high levels of violence, where it is absolutely necessary to analyze the most efficient way to obtain impacts of these clubs. I also aim to find evidence of peer effects of the intervention, assigning the participants in homogeneous and heterogeneous groups according to their violence level. I want to answer whether tracking participants according to a characteristic could improve the intervention results; or if the outcomes are higher due to peer effects, obtained from heterogeneous groups."
