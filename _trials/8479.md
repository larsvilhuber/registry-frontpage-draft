abstract: "Organisations are increasingly investing substantial time and money in the design and implementation of initiatives aimed at boosting the emotional and psychological well-being of their employees. While well-intentioned, the impact of such initiatives depends on the extent to which their employees engage with and use them. The aim of this trial is to test whether ‘nudges’ (Thaler & Sunstein, 2008) which have been shown to be effective at improving attendance in other contexts (e.g., Fishbane, Ouss & Shah, 2020; Dai et al. 2020) can be used to extend the reach of well-being initiatives within an organisational context, thus improving return on investment. We employ a RCT design to test the impact of four behavioural science nudge techniques (simplification, social proof, harnessing the default and changing the messenger), on the registration and participation rates of 7,000 employees in relation to three online ‘Lunch ‘n Learn’ well-being events being organised by a large Irish public sector organisation."
