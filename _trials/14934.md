abstract: "This project outlines a field experiment examining how information provision influences consumer adoption of Autonomous Taxis (ATs), a novel AI-driven transportation technology. Through randomized information interventions that emphasize either efficiency gains or social impact concerns regarding job replacement, we study the tradeoff between economic benefits and fairness considerations in technology adoption. By tracking both immediate responses and behavioral changes in short-term and long-term AT usage, this study provides causal evidence on how different types of information shape consumer decisions when confronting technological innovation.
