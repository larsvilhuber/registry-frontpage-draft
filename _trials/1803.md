abstract: "Through a randomized experiment, this study measures the impact of an innovative multi-faceted package of trainings-related activities targeted to private health providers in Nigeria on healthcare and financial outcomes. Facilities in the treatment group were offered a comprehensive training package that included counseling skills, contraceptive technology update, clinical skills, and business practices, while facilities in control were offered no training. Using data collected through facility and mystery client surveys, we estimated impacts on multiple healthcare and financial outcomes. Treated facilities increased the range of contraceptive methods offered by 10.2 percent relative to control facilities. Assignment to treatment also increased the overall quality of a provider's counseling services, interpersonal skills, and overall knowledge. Business practices also improved, although there was no effect on revenue generation."
