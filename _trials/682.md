abstract: "African agricultural markets are thin and weakly integrated, often resulting in lower revenues for smallholder farmers and higher food prices for consumers.  However, the causes of these price disparities are poorly understood.  How much is due to transaction costs -- for instance, poor roads and infrastructure, high search costs, and limited contract enforcement -- and how much is due to imperfect competition among private sector actors in these markets -- that is, to the ability of intermediaries to exert market power and drive prices away from competitive equilibria? The answer to this question has important implications for the type of market integration policies that should be promoted in order to have the greatest impact on price convergence and welfare.  This study has two aims: first, to quantify how competitive rural agricultural markets are, and, second, to test whether the entry of new intermediaries into markets can enhance competition among traders and increase consumer welfare."
