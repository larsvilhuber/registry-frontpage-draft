abstract: "Women continue to be significantly underrepresented in leadership roles, a persistent issue that can have far-reaching consequences. This underrepresentation may be attributed to the prevalence of gender stereotypes, and the existence of misperceived beliefs or perceptions about gender. This raises a crucial question: will individuals change their behavior once they become aware of these stereotypes or their misconceptions? We investigate the issue within the specific context of local government leaders in China. These leaders play an important role in evaluating the performance of their subordinates and determining promotions. The existence of stereotypes and misperceived beliefs may induce them to favor male subordinates in evaluations and promotions. To identify and mitigate the potential impact of stereotypes, we administer an Implicit Association Test (IAT) to these government leaders, followed by the random disclosure of the IAT scores to a portion of them. Besides, we elicit other beliefs or perceptions about gender and randomly provide some of them with feedback. These experiments allow us to explore whether revealing stereotypes and correcting misperceived beliefs serves as a powerful intervention in improving female leadership representation within the government."
