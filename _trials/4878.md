abstract: "We describe the analysis plan for analysis of survey data, which is aimed at probing mechanisms as a followup to findings from a previous study that examines the relationship between prosocial behavior and others’ beliefs in witchcraft in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Lowes and Nunn, 2018). As with the first study, participants will be individuals living in a city in Sud-Ubangi province which is in northern DRC. Participants will complete a series of incentivized questions asking about how socially appropriate most people in the city will view various actions in three experimental games that involve another player. For each hypothetical game, the other player is anonymous, but participants are given some information about them. They are informed of the other player’s age, sex, educational level, if from the same ethnic group, strength of belief in the Christian God, strength of belief in witchcraft, and whether the individual is from the city. The primary experimental treatment is that the other player is randomly assigned to have either a strong or weak belief in witchcraft. We outline the study design, the treatments, and the econometric strategy for the analysis.

We will also expand our sample to include 50 villages in rural areas. We will administer the activities described in Lowes and Nunn, 2018, and also implement the activities described above."
