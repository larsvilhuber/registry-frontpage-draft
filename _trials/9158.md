abstract: "This study tests whether the effects of redistribution on effort depend on how redistribution is framed. There are redistribution schemes that provide identical incentives in the sense that they result in the same disposable or net income for an agent with any given gross income. Yet, the idea has been proposed that framing affects incentives. In particular, universal basic income (UBI) is theorized to result in lower labor supply as the transfer is presented as unconditional in comparison to an equivalent negative income tax (NIT). Using a between-subject design, this RCT tests this hypothesis using a repeated real-effort experiment in which subjects receive payment for their performance, pay taxes and receive transfers. The two treatments result in the same net income for any distribution of gross income levels.
