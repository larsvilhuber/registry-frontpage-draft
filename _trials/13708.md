abstract: "Our research aim is to explore the effect of different visual, gustatory and olfactory stimulations
on our desire for food cravings and how they differ between the people who are more impulsive
or resistant. Additionally, we are curious whether having an empty stomach or stomach impacts
food cravings on these individuals, and how much. We want to explore how different
stimulations will affect the sense of food cravings in these different individuals. We want to
observe the people who tend to act impulsively and crave food more or less when exposed to
sensory stimulation. Furthermore, we want to analyse the people with a full or empty stomach
condition will change their response towards stimulation when it comes to food craving.The term craving is used to describe the strong motivational condition in which an individual is
urged to seek and ingest a particular substance (Eva & Marika 2010). It usually refers to drugs,
alcohol, or tobacco, but has become increasingly applied to food. Thus food cravings refer to an
intense desire for a particular food. It is the specialty that distinguishes a craving from ordinary
food choices and hunger (Eva & Marika 2015). The International Society for Research on
Impulsivity (ISRI) defines impulsivity as the tendency to act with less forethought than do most
individuals of equal ability and knowledge. Cognitive restraint is defined as the control over the
food intake to influence body shape and body weight.
In recent studies, the effect of cognitive reappraisal was analysed on food cravings which
resulted in people with cognitive appraisal craving low-calorie foods because they seemed
healthier as compared to the people who just viewed the food without any thinking and preferred
high calories since it looked more appetising. Another research on the relationship between
social media exposure, food cravings, cognitive impulsivity, and cognitive restraint was
conducted which showed a clear cross-sectional relationship between media time exposure and
food cravings and an increase in cognitive impulsivity levels.
If we can learn about the influence of our senses on food cravings we can help people make
healthier choices for the food and control their cravings. This may include techniques such as
altering the presentation or portion size of your food or utilising the distraction technique to
redirect the attention away from craving induce stimuli
