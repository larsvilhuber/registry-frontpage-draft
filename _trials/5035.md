abstract: "Successful adoption of relatively new post-harvest technologies in developing countries is often linked to the provision of mechanisms that allow potential users to overcome economic constraints. Effective research into designing adoption mechanisms incorporates two key dimensions: understanding the technical and perceived value of technologies by users, and carefully evaluating their implementation. We focus on the mechanism design for the adoption of hermetic bags (i.e. GrainPro bag) for rice seed storage. Proper seed storage may boost crop yields by increasing the germination rates and hermetic storage leads to higher quality seeds. While many economic studies examine the factors that deter technology adoptions in various contexts, we plan to focus on two constraints, liquidity and risk. Our goal is to evaluate which constraints serve as key barriers for smallholders in Bangladesh. Providing evidence on the relative importance of these pathways permits the design of more effective tools to target mechanisms that facilitate the adoption of valued technologies. "
