abstract: "The aim of this study is to elicit respondentsâ€™ willingness to pay (WTP) to reduce the risks of getting sick or dying from influenza or traffic accidents. The main objective is to derive estimates of the value of a statistical life and value of a statistical illness/injury that can be considered for policy purposes. In addition to this more policy focused objective the project also has two more research focused objectives: (i) to examine to what extent regret aversion may influence WTP for health-risk reduction, and (ii) to what extent loss-aversion, both financial and health, may influence WTP for health-risk reductions. Data will be collected using online stated-preference surveys with different treatments."
