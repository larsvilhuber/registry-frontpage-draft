abstract: "The UPSNP is a comprehensive social protection program that is designed to enhance the income of households living in the urban areas of Ethiopia, with the aim to reduce poverty and vulnerability. Beneficiaries engage in public works (PW) program or if they are unable to work, they receive an unconditional direct support transfer (DS).  

This document outlines the pre-analysis plan to study the effects of the UPSNP in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, one year after it started. The evaluation takes advantage of the randomization of the program at the woreda (urban district) level during its first year of implementation. Of the 90 eligible woredas in Addis, 35 were randomly assigned to start implementation right away (in year 1) while the remaining 55 were assigned to start implementation approximately 12 months later (in year 2). 

We study the effect of the program on household welfare, labour supply, and attitudes towards gender norms and welfare recipients. We do so by comparing households enrolled in the program in areas randomly selected to receive the program in year 1 to households enrolled in the program when it is rolled out in control neighbourhoods in year 2. 

With this study we aim to learn about key questions about the effects of public works programs. Among other things, we ask the following questions: First, what are the effects of public works on non-public works labour supply in urban contexts where labour markets are largely unaffected by seasonality? Second, if the program leads women who have not worked before, how does participation in public works affect gender norms around women's decisions to work? Third, do urban public works programs lead to noticeable improvements in public goods in local neighbourhoods, along the intended dimensions of the work activities? Fourth, how does the arrival of a comprehensive social safety net program in urban areas affect households attitudes to welfare programs and the state?
