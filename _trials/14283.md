abstract: "The primary aim of this study is to contribute to the body of work on evidence of what works in improving foundational learning for out-of-school children, especially those living in emergency contexts. AREAi has developed a model to teach out-of-school children in IDP camps in Nigeria functional literacy and numeracy skills using mother tongue-based targeted instruction. The program combines three proven, independent teaching and learning approaches: Mavis Talking Book and Pen (an offline digital pen with audio capabilities), Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL); and mother tongue-based literacy acquisition model: a dual language approach which involves using Hausa as abridge to learn English. This study examines the impacts of the program on children’s literacy and numeracy skills using a randomized controlled trial, and tests the added impact of a technology-enabled component that leverages the children’s community language (Hausa) for reading instruction. It further examines impacts on secondary outcomes including psychological well-being, educational aspirations, and later school enrollment. Specifically, the research questions are: (1) What is the impact of the full FastTrack program on displaced children’s basic literacy and numeracy skills? (2) What is the added value of the Mavis Pen? And (3) What are the impacts of FastTrack (with and without Mavis Pen) on displaced children's psychological well-being, educational aspirations, and later school enrollment? Results will provide information about the magnitude of effects, cost-effectiveness, and medium-term impacts on children’s academic skills and well-being."
