abstract: "In this study, we use a randomized field experiment in Karnataka, India, to measure the effects of a free inpatient public health insurance plan, Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY), on health and poverty. We randomize approximately 12,000 households in the two districts of Mysore and Gulbarga into one of four treatment or control groups, which receive:

1) Free RSBY inpatient coverage (the treatment group) 
2) Income transfer equal to the insurance premium for RSBY and the opportunity to buy RSBY at the same premium the government pays
3) The opportunity to buy RSBY at the same premium that the government pays
4) No treatment, except the survey compensation granted to all participants 

Our goal is to quantify how the RSBY program benefits health and reduces poverty in the short and medium term."
