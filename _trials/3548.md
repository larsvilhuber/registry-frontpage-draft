abstract: "Background: The birth process remains to be a critical and highly risky period in mothers´ and children´s lives and accounts for half of all child deaths. Based on the success of checklist programs in other disciplines, the World Health Organisation (WHO) developed the Safe Childbirth Checklist (SCC) – a tool that targets the major causes of maternal and newborn mortality. The trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the WHO’s Safe Childbirth Checklist (SCC) in combination with a light coaching approach.
