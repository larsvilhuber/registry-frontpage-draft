abstract: "The lack of affordable housing is a common problem in many cities in both rich and poor countries. In many countries, governments own a large share of the housing stock and offer subsidized public housing in order to address this problem. We are proposing two randomized experiments to understand the impact of public housing on a variety of outcomes as well as whether additional resources and assistance for those moving into public housing can help households adjust following the move. First, we seek to examine the impacts of winning a lottery to receive public housing. Second, among the pool of people who have moved into public housing, we will randomize whether they receive an additional package of assistance aimed to help them with the transition. "
