abstract: "A large amount of aid money flows annually from wealthy nations to less developed nations, with roughly one quarter from private donations. A longstanding policy question is what form this aid should take. Improving the quality of aid requires not only understanding the effects of different forms of aid but also knowing why decision-makers send some forms of aid instead of others. This study aims to provide new evidence on the behavior of possible aid donors. In particular, we study the extent to which donors update their donation decisions after learning about recipient's preferences for cash vs goods as aid."
