abstract: "We study the impact of a cash transfer program targeting vulnerable households in Benin on the condition that they keep enrolling their adolescent daughter to secondary school. We randomly vary the recipient of the transfer to compare the effects of the program when a female guardian receives the money rather than a male guardian. We investigate whether the conditional cash transfer improves girls' schooling (enrollment, attendance and performance), and several measures of adolescents' autonomy. We also investigate whether the schooling outcomes of the other children in the household are affected by the transfer."
