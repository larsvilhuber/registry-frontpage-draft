abstract: "The spice sector has been recognized as one of the priority sectors in Sri Lanka's National Export Strategy, targeting superior export performance through high-value markets with high quality products. The training program on post-harvest quality improvement of black pepper represents a crucial component of the Post-Harvest Technology Investment Assistant Scheme implemented by the Department of Export Agriculture in Sri Lanka with the objective of product quality enhancement.
Despite significant government investments in this program, there has been a notable absence of impact evaluation, rendering decision-making challenging, as program allocation lacks a random basis. Moreover, existing research in the realm of agricultural training and technology adoption predominantly focuses on pre-harvest aspects, leaving a substantial gap in addressing post-harvest quality improvement. 
This research aims to gauge the impact of the post-harvest quality improvement training program on three core aspects: knowledge enhancement among farmers knowledge enhancement among farmers, behavioural shifts in pepper farmers for adopting quality measures, and the resultant quality enhancement of black pepper. Conducted through a Randomized Control Trial, the study seeks to measure the knowledge gained, behavioural changes, and the quality improvements directly influenced by the training program.
Through this experimental approach, we can bridge the existing knowledge gaps and contribute to the development of more effective, evidence-based interventions in the field of post-harvest quality improvement in black pepper.
