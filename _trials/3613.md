abstract: "The study randomly assigns VSLAs to two treatments: one providing a group-level savings account from a local bank, and the second providing the same savings account plus the possibility of getting a group level loan from the bank. The study is intended to provide groups with access to a safe place to store money, in addition to relaxing possible constraints that limit the ability of groups to lend to members. At the time of writing of this PAP, researchers had implemented the intervention and carried out one round of data collection (midline). An endline will be concluded in 2019. The data have yet to be analyzed."
