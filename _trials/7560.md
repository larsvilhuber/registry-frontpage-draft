abstract: "An increasingly complex socio-economic landscape has recently highlighted the importance of decision-making under uncertainty. Making decisions under conditions of uncertainty is crucial to technological innovation, social change, and the creation of new ideas, and it is at the core of entrepreneurship. However, evidence suggests that entrepreneurs lack a method to make decisions under conditions of uncertainty. This project extends prior work that shows that entrepreneurs can improve their ability to make these decisions by adopting a scientific approach based on the formulation of models tested with data, such as scientists do. 
It proposes to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to provide solid evidence and identify elements of greatest importance in application of the scientific approach. By scientific approach to entrepreneurial decision making, we mean that entrepreneurs should behave in a fashion similar to scientists -- accurately framing and identifying the problem they wish to address, articulating theories, defining clear hypotheses, conducting rigorous tests to prove or disprove these hypotheses, measuring the results of the tests, and making decisions based on these tools. 
Building on prior research conducted in Italy, the United Kingdom and India, this works focuses on the particularly important setting of uncertain decision making in the context of the food and agricultural sectors in Tanzania. Effective entrepreneurial behavior is critically important to sustained economic development in developing nations such as Tanzania, where the food and agricultural sector typically is the largest sector in terms of the number of workers employed.
