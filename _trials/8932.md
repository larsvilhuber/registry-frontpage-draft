abstract: "I implement an incentivized online experiment with a sample of women from the general population from the US. The sample consists of 2,000 women of US nationality recruited on the online platform Prolific. The participants report to be either employed (either full-time or part-time) or unemployed seeking for a job. The aim of the experiment is to understand whether the beliefs about the gender gap in salary negotiation affects women’s incentivized choices in a labor market context. By providing truthful information that women are way less prone to negotiate their salary compared to men (based on Babcock and Laschever (2003)), I exogenously manipulate the beliefs of the participants on the gender gap in salary negotiation and how the beliefs impact of the participants’ information demand for either an AAUW pamphlet on how to negotiate or the average monthly salary for the workers in the participants’ sector. Finally, I collect the respondents’ behavior in a bargaining situation where they have to bid their reservation wage to join a extra-task to gain a bonus payment. The respondents know that they are matched with participants from another platform (who act as an "employer")."
