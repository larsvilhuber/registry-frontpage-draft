abstract: "The experiment studies the effects of a financing mechanism for the health sector in which governmental payment to health facilities is contingent upon the number of patients for some pre-determined health services, as opposed to a fixed payment. Even though performance-based financing models have been implemented in developed and developing countries in various settings and forms, the scientific evidence on its impact on health worker effort and consequent health outcomes remains thin. From 2009 to 2013, a research project was conducted in the Haut-Katanga district of DRC to study the effect of the PBF approach compared to a fixed payment approach. The 96 health areas present in the Haut-Katanga district were randomly assigned to performance-based or fixed payments, while ensuring that the same amount of governmental resources was allocated to each group to neutralize the ressource effect. The two mechanisms have been in place from June 2010 to September 2012. Administrative data was collected throughout the project, spotchecks of health workers' attendance were performed in July, August and September 2012, and a final independent survey was administered from December 2012 to Feburary 2013 -after the incentives have been withdrawn. We give evidence that pay-for-performance led to more effort from health workers with respect to rewarded services. Equally important, health workers did not substitute effort put in non-rewarded activities. However, the increase in overall staff motivation happened at the expense of its intrinsic component. Finally, the increased effort put in by the health workers proved unsuccessful at attracting more patients, suggesting that health workers lacked means or inventiveness to meet their objective. There are key policy implications of our findings for governments considering PBF as a way to allocate public ressources to the health sector. First, pay-for-performance increases health worker overall motivation without deterring service quality or non-rewarded services, meaning that health workers are strategic but not cynical; However, two types of precaution should be considered. First, contingent rewards reduce the intrinsic component of health worker motivation so incentives should be used as a permanent instrument otherwise it would backfire. Second, our results suggest that contingent rewards are not appropriate when the task is difficult and requires sophisticated strategies, because agents focus on the reward and do not develop novel ideas to reach complicated goals. The translation of motivation into performance may thus be better in contexts where the rewarded task is easy."
