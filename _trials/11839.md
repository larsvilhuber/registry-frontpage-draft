abstract: "The conventional intervention currently being provided for migrant women who receive welfare in Murcia consists exclusively of receiving a monetary compensation. The "+ que Emple-A" project has a general objective that consists of verifying that the implementation of the "3I" methodology (psychosocial intervention and training in digital skills from intercultural mediation) will improve social inclusion (four dimensions : material resources, skills and competencies, social relations and psychosocial factors) of the migrant women receiving the minimum income schemes (national or regional) in the Region of Murcia."
