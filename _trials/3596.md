abstract: "We are sending letters to potential rental income debtors living in six of the most affluent districts in Peru. These letters contain messages
referring to social norms (informing that most of their neighbors pay their taxes), civic duty (informing why is it important to pay taxes), enforcement actions taken by the tax authority, and a reminder (i.e. control group). A sample of 9,024 individuals was randomly assigned to receive one of these types of messages four times, during a period of four months. The objective is to estimate and compare the effects of the first three types of messages on tax compliance. In contrast to most of the literature, we are carrying out an endline survey to evaluate the mechanisms that underpin the observed behavioral responses."
