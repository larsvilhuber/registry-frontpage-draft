abstract: "We conducted a field experiment to investigate the causal impact of social media promotion on job market outcomes for Economics job market candidates (JMCs), with a particular focus on under-represented groups such as women, racial and ethnic minorities, and the LGBTQ+ community. We asked economist "influencers" with more than 4,500 followers on Twitter to quote-tweet a random subset of job market paper tweets on Econ Job Helper. We will subsequently measure the impact of this intervention on job market outcomes. Preliminary analysis reveals an increase in the visibility of job market papers for the treatment group, as their tweets receive higher numbers of likes, retweets, and URL clicks. Currently, job market outcomes are being collected to further analyze whether social media promotion can help JMCs receive more job interviews, fly-outs, and job offers. The results of this study will enhance our understanding of the efficacy of social media promotion in influencing job market outcomes for junior scholars, especially for those from under-represented groups in the academic job market."
