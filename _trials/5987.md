abstract: "We have previously found that exposure of men to women in the Norwegian army changes attitudes about mixed-gender productivity, gender roles, and gender identity in the short run. We will now investigate longer term effects on the same outcomes as well as effects on other outcomes using register data. We have not yet received the register data and in this plan we describe the hypotheses to be tested and how they will be tested once we get the data. The description includes how the variables are coded, how we will deal with missing values, and the specification of the estimation equations."
