abstract: "The project focuses on government service provision in the key sector of health services. Pakistan is one of the few countries in the world where polio remains an endemic disease. Government efforts to eradicate polio make use of government service workers, seconded to vaccination for limited drives of 2-3 days. Seconded workers are given vaccination material and a rudimentary map of their catchment area to cover. Daily wages are provided, but no explicit incentives are given for task completion. In principle, vaccinations are recorded on daily work sheets and via chalk markings on the door of each approached house. Some concern about task completion exists, but no detailed records on malfeasance are kept at the Ministry of Health. This project focuses on two dimensions of government service provision: malfeasance and the intertemporal organization of work. Subjects are randomized into various contract types.
