abstract: "Political radicalization leads to significant economic costs. Modern information and communication technologies offer a suitable set of tools for cost-effective targeting the people at risk of radicalizing.  The gamification approach in particular promises to increase engagement, learning, and therefore impact of any prevention measure. Using a randomized online field experiment, we investigate the impact of a gamified online intervention on political radicalization."
