abstract: "This study explores the dynamics of voluntary information disclosure within the housing rental market, an area often characterized by asymmetric information. Employing an online experimental approach using a sender-receiver game framework, we investigate the strategic thinking and behavior of homeowners (senders) as they disclose property details to potential tenants (receivers). Through a one-time revelation game setup, we analyze the strategic interactions between senders and receivers under different conditions of information asymmetry.

The research includes two parallel experiments to separately observe the decision-making processes of senders and receivers. We test hypotheses regarding the effects of the size of the set of potential hidden values on the likelihood of information disclosure and the accuracy of the receivers' guesses. These hypotheses are examined within a within-subject treatment framework. The study specifically evaluates whether a smaller set of potential values leads to more accurate forecasts, potentially simplifying decision-making and diminishing the strategic advantage of withholding information.

Furthermore, we establish a between-subject variation framework to assess whether awareness of a specific distribution's realization encourages more frequent disclosure. Our aim is to simulate a real-world scenario related to the disclosure of climate risks to analyze decision-making under specified conditions and to provide insights that may assist policymakers in promoting voluntary information disclosure."
