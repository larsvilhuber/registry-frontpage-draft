abstract: "If individuals perceive preferences as gender-dependent, they might use gender composition in different occupations as a signal of underlying characteristics. The aim of this project is to explore this potential signalling effect of gender composition. To this end, I perform an online experiment where subjects choose between jobs solely based on summary statistics about the individuals in each career path. In this plan I describe hypotheses to be tested, the coding of variables, and the empirical strategy that will be used."
