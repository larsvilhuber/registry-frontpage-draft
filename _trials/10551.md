abstract: "We have designed an experiment to study the welfare and labor market impacts of expanding job-displacement insurance in Ethiopia. A large ready-made garment factory in the Hawassa Industrial Park were laid off a large number of female workers.  As is common in low-income countries, these workers will be eligible for a modest lump-sum severance pay and will not receive unemployment insurance. Recent research suggests that many of them will be unable to secure another job quickly, food security will deteriorate, and they will return to their homes in the countryside (Hardy et al., 2022). In this project, we will evaluate the impacts of offering (i) a scheme which pays 60 percent of the workerâ€™s wage for 5 months, irrespective of employment status and (ii) a single lump-sum payment of the same value as the income support scheme. Through phone-based high-frequency surveys, we will study impacts on consumption, job-search, and employment outcomes. We will also look at broader impacts on migration decisions, mental health, and women empowerment. Finally, we will study how exposure to additional job-displacement insurance payments affects the demand for future insurance."
