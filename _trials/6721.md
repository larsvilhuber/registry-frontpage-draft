abstract: "Does security design affect household investment decisions? If so, which payoff design can nudge households into making the right savings or investment decisions? By contrast, can banks use the design of financial products to extract rents from investors by exploiting a gap between how household perceive payoffs and the fair value of these payoffs is? We analyze these research questions by implementing a series of investment experiments. We aim to measure demand elasticity to payoff designs and their parameters, as well as estimate their impact on investor behavior and surplus.
