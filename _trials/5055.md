abstract: "This survey experiment will study whether presenting a vignette on Chinaâ€™s rising aid presence in the Pacific changes views about aid policy in New Zealand (New Zealand is the second largest aid donor to the Pacific). Attitudes in the following areas will be tested: (a) attitudes on total New Zealand aid volume; (b) the Pacific focus of New Zealand's aid; and (c) the purpose of New Zealand's aid giving."
