abstract: "The tax base for property taxation in Belgium is based on rental values from 1975. Newly constructed or renovated houses need to be appraised as being built in 1975. To this end, the administration makes use of predetermined valuations based on the characteristics of the house and the location. Due to this method, the appraisal is mainly driven by objective determinants. Taxpayers can file an appeal upon receiving the appraised value. Due to the lack of subjective elements in the appraisal method, these appeal only seem justified when the objective characteristics are wrongfully recorded by the government. By changing the notification letter, which informs the Belgium taxpayers of their new tax base, we, in collaboration with the Belgium government, try to reduce the amount of unjustified appeals.  

The main treatment of this experiment alters the lay-out of and the information available on the notification letter. The goal of these changes is to focus the attention on the objective characteristics that determine the tax base. By doing so, we intent to make it clearer based on which characteristics the property is appraised. 

Furthermore, we add some extra information in 3 other treatments. (1) We inform the taxpayer about the length of an appeal procedure. By giving the average length of the previous year and the average length of all the available years, we try to create some variation to elicit the effect of this treatment. This will give the taxpayer more information concerning the time cost of going through an appeal procedure. (2) We inform the taxpayers about the percentage of successful appeals by all the appraised houses. (3) We will inform the taxpayers about the estimated tax base of other similar houses in the neighborhood. 

An accompanying survey will question the knowledge and attitudes towards the appraised value and the appeal process. This will enable us to evaluate the change in knowledge and attitudes with regard to the appraisals.
