abstract: "COVID-19 poses a major threat to countries around the world. Prior to distribution of vaccines to the general population, efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 are limited to non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing and face coverings. Although conflicting recommendations have been issued, recent evidence suggests that face masks may significantly reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, questions remain on how to effectively promote mask adoption: Despite masks being mandatory, recent evidence shows less than 20% wear them at markets in Western Kenya. Together with the Ministry of Health in Siaya county, we evaluate a pilot program that distributes a free mask to each citizen, combined with educational interventions informed by insights from behavioral economics.
