abstract: "Air pollution is a significant problem, especially in big cities and industrial agglomerations, and thus affects a substantial part of the population. Permanently exceeding the concentration limits of some pollutants has a very significant impact on the health of the population, especially children and other vulnerable groups. The research deals with air pollution exposure in children and the effect of awareness on change in behaviour, attitudes and preferences. The individual exposure of children to air pollution is determined using personal samplers. The parents of the children are subsequently given detailed individual reports on the results of their child's measurements, including comments and descriptions. The issue of air pollution and potential health impacts is also explained. Parents of children fill in questionnaires regarding preferences, attitudes, and behaviour at the beginning of personnel sampling and after the intervention, which provides the report with information about the child's exposure. A control group without intervention is included."
