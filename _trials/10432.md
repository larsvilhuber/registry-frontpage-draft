abstract: "Belief in misinformation causes confusion, reduces trust in authorities and encourages risky behaviours that can cause significant harm to health, as exemplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Social media platforms have taken several policy measures to address this challenge; working with independent fact-checking companies to label inaccurate content, promoting verified information through prompts of fact-checked articles, or tailoring the algorithm to demote false posts in the newsfeed. But how effective are these measures? I aim to address this issue with a focus on Facebook and its policies to combat health-related misinformation in the context of the Global South. My study has three key goals. First, using an online survey experiment I will evaluate the effectiveness of a specific label currently used by Facebook to debunk misinformation. Second, I aim to examine design tweaks informed by behavioural science to improve the effectiveness of the existing labels. Finally, I will examine if introducing a very low-cost and scalable digital media literacy intervention increase discernment between true and false, as well as increases the effectiveness of the label in debunking misinformation. I will collect data in two waves, spaced two weeks apart to measure if the effects endure over a period of time.  "
