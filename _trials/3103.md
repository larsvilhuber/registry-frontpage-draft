abstract: "At the heart of any strong tax system lies the ability to accurately observe the activities of economic agents, and the ability to use this information as inputs into an efficient billing, collection, and enforcement process. Constraints on either of these two capacities can have large adverse impacts. In the context of local property taxation, appropriately designed information technologies (IT) have the potential to alleviate these capacity constraints, and the optimistic view surrounding IT solutions has gained momentum from recent technological advances. But despite technology investments holding the promise to significantly improve tax and broader state capacities, there is no well-identified evidence on the returns to such investments. In collaboration with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Local Government, we randomized the order in which 64 local governments in Ghana were offered a locally developed IT system to collect property and businesses taxes."
