abstract: "This study aims to investigate if honesty pledges are able to improve honest reporting among applicants to a volunteer program. Participants will be randomly allocated into intervention versus control conditions, where the former will receive the honesty pledge at the beginning of their form, and the latter will not. The honesty pledge will be a single statement asking applicants to click a box if they pledge to respond honestly in their application. Researchers will evaluate if there is an observable difference between the answers of the control and treatment groups, which will indicate that the honesty pledge led to a reduction in dishonest behavior.
