abstract: "Achieving success often requires persistent efforts over a long period of time. Persistent effort, however, is hard. While gritty ones can rely on their own stamina, many others probably do not have enough willpower to maintain effort for a long period of time. This project examines whether we can design external mechanisms to incentivize persistent efforts. "
