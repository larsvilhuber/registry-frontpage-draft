abstract: "This study evaluates the effect of introducing a VAT receipt lottery for customers on business' receipt printing behavior, their reported sales, VAT-registration and VAT revenues in Tanzania. VAT receipts printed from Electronic Fiscal Devices (EFDs) are used as tickets in a lottery with weekly and monthly monetary prizes. The lottery is expected to act as an incentive, pushing customers to request receipts.  Increasing the issuance of VAT receipts will improve  the information about transactions available to the government because the EFD machines automatically send transaction details to the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA). This, in turn, makes enforcement easier, and is therefore expected to increase VAT compliance. The lottery is implemented by the Tanzania Revenue Authority in one of the tax regions (Tegeta) from July to October 2022. To evaluate its effects, we use a difference-in-difference event study estimator comparing the outcomes in the region with the lottery (treated) to the regions without a lottery (control)."
