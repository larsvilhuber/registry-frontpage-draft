abstract: "Assessing the causal impact of wealth on attitudes and well-being is a challenging task, since an individual’s economic situation may depend on unobserved characteristics which are likely to be correlated with such outcomes. We overcome this challenge by exploiting the exogenous variation in wealth created by a housing lottery in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, which randomly allocates the right to purchase an apartment among low-income applicants. Since the apartments are sold at highly subsidized rates, winners of the lottery experience a substantial boost to long-term wealth. We focus on the causal effects of winning the lottery on two separate domains: (i) changes in attitudes toward redistribution and meritocratic beliefs and (ii) economic and psychological well-being. This plan is registered before the data collection started. All deviations from the plan will be highlighted in the papers.  "
