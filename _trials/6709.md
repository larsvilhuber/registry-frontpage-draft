abstract: "In a meritocratic society inequality in economic outcomes that reflects differences in individual achievements is considered fair. However, a particular achievement is not equally difficult for everyone. I study two types of differences in difficulties: external circumstances – difficulty of the task an individual faces – and individual ability in the task. In an online experiment, I test how people redistribute income within pairs that was earned by merit with information about how difficult the task was – either in terms of external difficulty or ability in the task –  for the members of the pair.
