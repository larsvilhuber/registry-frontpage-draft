abstract: "Self-regulation plays an important role in adolescent development, predicting success in multiple domains including school and social relationships. Adolescents with better self-regulatory abilities are also less likely to engage in transgressive behaviors and more likely to engage in prosocial behaviors. Aggressive behavior expressed by adolescents is a worrying phenomenon. There might be circumstances underlying this aggression, such as adaptive or maladaptive emotional conditions. This requires the critical need for indigenous, evidence-based intervention to address the stated problem of adolescents and provide the intervention in the future. Thus, this clinical trial provides an intervention plan using cognitive behavior therapy techniques for the self-regulation and emotion regulation.  A sample of 24, secondary school children, aged 14 -18 years, will be approached from 4 private schools located in Rawalpindi. Initial screening will be carried out and then participants are going to be randomized into the intervention arm and control arm. Participants in the intervention arm will receive cognitive-behavioral therapy. A total of 8 group therapy sessions, each lasting for at least 50-60 minutes will be given. While participants in the control arm will receive no such treatment. The feasibility investigation demonstrates self control among participants and the acceptability of the design. Results of this feasibility randomized control trial will further be beneficial in the capacity building of teachers who can further identify the risk factors of self control issues and be able to take precautionary measures on time."
