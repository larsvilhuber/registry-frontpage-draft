abstract: "Women may face systematically greater benefits than men from adopting certain household technologies, or greater costs from non-adoption. Yet women may also hold systematically lower bargaining power, which may act as a constraint to take-up if the adoption decision is joint. Introducing a version of the technology that is second-best in terms of cost or effectiveness, but more acceptable to men, may increase
adoption and potentially welfare. 

We conducted a field experiment in Maputo, Mozambique, introducing female condoms in a setting with high HIV prevalence. The intervention consisted of six group training sessions lasting ninety minutes each, held fortnightly over a three month period. Sessions were held in community buildings with groups of five to twelve women, facilitated by female health workers from the local area. The intervention allows us to study which women, if any, adopt female condoms when informational, supply and price constraints are alleviated.
