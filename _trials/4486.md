abstract: "Previous work has shown that people (1) neglect selection when they learn from a sample (2) avoid information that they expect to be negative or misaligned with their preferences and (3) tend to update asymmetrically and conservatively (compared to the Bayesian benchmark) when receiving information that is ego relevant.  Although all these results have been individually observed in isolated studies, our study presents a simple experiment that allows us to investigate how these effects could possibly interact and further compound biased beliefs."
