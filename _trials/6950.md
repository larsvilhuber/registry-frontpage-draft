abstract: "Every year tens of thousands of Affordable Care Act (ACA) enrollees, who are eligible for Enhanced Silver plans, enroll in Gold or Platinum plans wherein they pay higher monthly premiums for a plan with lower actuarial value. This project's goal is to examine whether direct mail and email reminders can increase Enhanced Silver take-up among Covered California households enrolled in Gold or Platinum plans for the 2020 coverage year. Enrollment in choice error plans is common across different health insurance markets--including Medicare, employer-sponsored insurance and the ACA Marketplaces--and thus identifying ways to improve choice quality is of interest to policymakers both in California and nationwide.
