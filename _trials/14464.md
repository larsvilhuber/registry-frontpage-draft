abstract: "This trial tests an innovative intervention to boost the lending capacity of village savings and loans associations (VSLAs) in rural Malawi. Our pre-analysis plan describes a cluster randomized control trial (RCT) in which VSLAs in treated communities will receive between $350 and $590 USD capital injection to boost the groupsâ€™ lending capacity, depending on the group size. Outcomes are assessed in five domains: financial inclusion, livelihoods, welfare, food security, and gender. The trial is designed to document spillover effects in local labor markets. "
