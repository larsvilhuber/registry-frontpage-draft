abstract: "HPTN071/PopART is a community randomized trial that is investigating whether a community-wide combination HIV prevention package including annual home-based HIV testing, active referral and the offer of immediate ART for those testing HIV-positive, along with the promotion of proven HIV prevention methods (such as voluntary medical male circumcision and condom use), will help to prevent transmission and substantially reduce new HIV infections. The study was conducted in 21 communities in Zambia and South Africa (randomized into 3 arms, each with 7 communities) with a total population of approximately 1.2 million individuals. The economic evaluation of the HPTN071/PopART trial is a secondary outcome of the study. It's objective is to determine the societal value of the trial with a cost-effectiveness analysis that compares the incremental benefits and costs of the PopART intervention against enhanced standard of HIV care in the study communities. The economic evaluation also analyses the impact of the intervention on other economic outcomes, including work productivity, inequality in incomes and access to healthcare, and impact on health-related quality-of-life.
