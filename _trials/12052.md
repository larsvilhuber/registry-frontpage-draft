abstract: "The purpose of this research study is to test the effects of three “certainties” on college application, enrollment, and persistence among high-ability, low-income students. The intervention involves randomized access to informational materials that jointly provide certainty about admissions, tuition, and housing. All treated students are guaranteed that, for four years, financial aid will cover tuition costs, they will have a place in on-campus housing, and they will receive a $1,800 subsidy toward housing. Moreover, all students in the top 6% of their graduating cohort are guaranteed admission. This intervention builds on Dynarki et al. (2021), which provided certainty about tuition to Michigan students. This study includes Texas students who are in the Top 10% of their 12th-grade cohort and are eligible for the Free and Reduced-Price Lunch program."
