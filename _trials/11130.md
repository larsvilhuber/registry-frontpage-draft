abstract: "Paying taxes typically involves a legally-required transfer of personal resources to the government to fund activities including the provision of public services. In developing countries, states often have limited capacity to collect taxes because tax authorities themselves are commonly under-funded and because the public may not be accustomed to paying taxes. In our study setting, we examine whether sending different types of messages to property owners from a property tax collection agency can improve the collection of tax revenue. The different messages provide information on the ease of the tax collection process, appeal to the public benefits of tax collection, and/or provide information on deadlines related to discounts and penalties applied to the tax assessment."
