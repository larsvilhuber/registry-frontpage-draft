abstract: "In many vulnerable democracies, radicalization poses a significant challenge. Radicalization as a precursor to political violence may be a threat to both democracy and development. Policymakers must decide from many policy options based on little to no evidence. Does limiting access to hate literature work best or is it the case that counter-narrative messaging and subsidizing competitorsâ€™ content more effective? We hope to inform this debate and contribute to the literature on determinants of political violence by conducting a pilot study where we explore the feasibility of several interventions that may reduce support for extremist ideologies. Our focus groups with vulnerable populations guide us to pilot 6 interventions. The randomized evaluation stemming from this pilot may provide new causal evidence on: i. how hate literature impacts support for extremist ideologies? ii. Does subsidizing counter-narrative messaging work, if so, what kind of counter-messaging is most likely to reduce support for extremist violence? iii. Does reducing access to hate literature and counter-narratives work as complements or substitutes?"
