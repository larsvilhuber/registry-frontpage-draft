abstract: "This randomized control trial will determine the most cost-effective way to encourage caregivers to participate in online training programs. We will partner with Helping Restore Ability (HRA), a non-profit that supports thousands of caregivers in Texas, as they roll out a new online training program to improve in-home care quality. To encourage training take-up, four treatment arms will receive emails with varying levels of altruistic messaging and financial compensation. Members of the control group will receive a standard email with no incentive for training completion. This study will determine the impact of these messaging strategies and financial incentives on participation and performance in the training program."
