abstract: "Vietnam is a country where eye health care infrastructure is inferior to its economic growth and income level. The eye health care for children is especially limited in Vietnam: around one-fifth of the children under 15 years old are suffering from uncorrected refractive errors. Uncorrected refractive errors at school age are not only a vision problem, but also may affect school achievement that ultimately may have a significant impact on labor market outcomes and poverty. This paper presents the effect of vision screening and free eyeglasses on children's academic performance at school in Thanh Hoa province, Vietnam. We use a school-level cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate providing vision screening and free eyeglasses to primary school students in Grades 4 and 5. We find that approximately 10.7 percent and 9.6 percent of grade 4 and 5 students suffer from vision impairment and uncorrected refractive errors in Thanh Hoa province. Furthermore, while 27 percent of students with refractive errors already had eyeglasses, only 29 percent of them had appropriate eyeglasses. We also find that providing vision screening and free eyeglasses successfully increases children's test scores. The magnitude of the impact ranges from 0.16 to 0.22 standard deviations for reading test scores, 0.16 to 0.23 standard deviations for mathematics test scores, and 0.14 to 0.26 standard deviations for total test scores after one year of providing eyeglasses. This paper also provides heterogenous effect of enhancing low vision on students' test score by gender and vision impairment level."
