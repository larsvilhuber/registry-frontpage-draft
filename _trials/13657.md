abstract: "We will conduct a survey about opioid misuse and naloxone access in a nationally-representative sample and a sample that has previously stated that they suffer from opioid dependence.  Within the survey, we will ask the respondents to provide their maximum willingness-to-pay for a two-dose kit of Narcan.  Respondents will be randomized into one of two arms.  In the first arm, the experiment will specify that the purchase will be made "from a pharmacist."  In the second, they will be told that the purchase will be made "over-the-counter."  We are interested in whether there are differences in the willingness-to-pay for naloxone based on where the naloxone is purchased from.  We hypothesize that respondents will be willing to pay more to purchase naloxone over-the-counter to avoid interaction with a pharmacist and any associated stigma with this purchase.     "
