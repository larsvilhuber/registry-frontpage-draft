abstract: "This evaluation assesses the impact of the ILO's occupational Safety and Health Program on small and medium-sized enterprises in the Indonesian manufacturing sector. While working in the manufacturing sector is hazardous per se due to the use of heavy machinery, tools, chemicals and the like, workers are even more at risk in an environment where basic labor standards are not enforced. Resulting work place accidents leading to the temporal or permanent inability to work, or even death, have severe economic consequences. Workers face unexpected health expenditures and the sudden loss of income. For enterprises, the sudden loss of workers interrupts productive activities and may affect profitability if enterprises cannot compensate the shortfall in labor in the production process.
   
The Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) program of the ILO aims to improve occupational safety and health of SME workers in East Java. More specifically, the innovation implements kick-off trainings and several after-trainings to foster behavioral change with respect to workplace conditions among SMEs. After-trainings attempt to reinforce the occupational safety and health training through monitoring visits. The target population comprises manufacturing SMEs client to a local microfinance institution. Ultimately, OSH is believed to improve workers' health and increase productivity of SMEs."
