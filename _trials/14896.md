abstract: "We plan to conduct a representative survey, including survey experiments, with a sample of approximately 2,500 German adults. Our aims are to
a) administer a newly developed measurement battery for economic literacy and use psychometric techniques to derive a measure of economic literacy. 
b) investigate the association of the measure with various background characteristics, including socio-demographic characteristics, measures of economic preferences, financial literacy, intelligence, and background in economics education 
c) investigate the measure's association with individuals' economic values, policy preferences, and economic expectations.

Using survey experiments and our measure of economic literacy to generate subgroups of participants with high and low economic literacy, we aim to address the following specific research questions:
i) Does information about the tradeoffs associated with economic policies have a causal effect on policy preferences among individuals with low and high economic literacy?
ii) Does the effect of information about tradeoffs differ between individuals with low and high economic literacy?"
