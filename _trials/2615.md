abstract: "What do people consider a fair distribution of educational resources between high and low ability children? To what extent do people let efficiency considerations and motivation levels matter when making this trade-off? I study this experimentally, using a novel design implemented on a representative sample of 2000 Americans. The participants distribute one-to-one tutoring between students who learn quickly and students who take more time and learn slower. To study underlying mechanisms, I use a between-design and include treatments where I vary the relative price of tutoring for the two groups of learners, as well as the relative motivation level between the learners."
