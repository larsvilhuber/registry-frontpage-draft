abstract: "Female labor force participation (henceforth FLPF) is very low in Saudi Arabia and social norms appear to be a constraint to female employment in the country. In the first round of our experiment, we surveyed groups of Saudi Arabian men and found that most men privately support female labor force participation while believing that others hold much more conservative views. At the end of the survey, participants were given a choice between a $5 Amazon gift card and the opportunity to sign-up their wife for an online job matching service. An information treatment showing randomly selected participants the distribution of true beliefs increased the likelihood that participants chose the job matching service sign-up, suggesting that correcting individual beliefs about others may be an effective way to encourage female labor force participation. This follow-up trial, which will take place three months after the initial experiment, aims to understand the lasting effects of our information treatment on beliefs about the opinions of others, the labor force status of participants' wives and the potential spillover effect on a different but related outcome about attitudes towards the personal freedoms of women--the willingness of men to sign up their wives for driving lessons."
