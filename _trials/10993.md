abstract: "Point-of-use (POU) drinking water treatment plays a crucial role in overcoming the health burden associated with waterborne diarrheal disease in low and middle-income regions. This study focuses on the  impacts of three POU water treatments, boiling on a rocket stove, ceramic filtration, and membrane filtration, in two districts of rural Western Uganda in the course of 18 months. On the one hand, we measure the effectiveness of the intervention on microbiological water quality and health. We compare the water treatment systems from a user perspective, on the other hand, including affordability, effective demand, labor burden and user acceptance.  A total of 600 households are involved in this randomized controlled trial. 450 households receive one of the three treatments and training on its adequate usage. 150 households are assigned to the control group. Data collection involves household surveys, health diaries and water sample analysis during a baseline and four follow-ups. "
