abstract: "Over half a million children between 0 and 5 years of age in Colombia have been affected by a civil conflict that has spanned over six decades. Exposure to violence during early childhood may have devastating consequences on early childhood cognitive and socio-emotional development. 
The devastating effects of violence on early childhood development occur through two different and complementary channels: First, excessive stress stemming from the exposure violence and other early childhood adversities disrupts the architecture of the developing brain (NSCDC, 2005) and inhibits the appropriate functioning of the body’s stress-response system.  Second, violence brings about a legacy of poverty and psychological trauma (Ibañez & Moya, 2010; Moya, 2018), which undermines the primary caregivers’ capacity to form healthy emotional bonds with their children and increases the likelihood of extreme neglect (Lieberman and Van Horn, 2011; Cuartas, Harker, & Moya, 2015). This means that children’s development is at risk even if they are not exposed to violence directly; for example, if their parents had been victimized previously. Taken together, violence can impair the development of key cognitive and socio-emotional abilities therefore compromising the right to lead healthy and productive lives for thousands of children in Colombia. 
Protecting children from effects of violence, toxic stress, and deficits in family care is therefore one of the key challenges as Colombia transitions into a post-conflict stage and for the construction of a more equal and peaceful society. More generally, identifying cost effective ways to guarantee children’s cognitive and socioemotional development is a key challenge in contexts of violence and humanitarian crises around the world.
In this trial, we evaluate the effectiveness of Semillas de Apego, a group-based psychosocial program for victimized caregivers with children 2 to 5 in Colombia, a country devastated by decades of civil violence. The program builds upon recent evidence on the positive effects of different interventions that limit the harmful consequences of childhood stress in the United States through the promotion of maternal mental health and healthy child-parent emotional bonds (Lieberman & Van Horn, 2011; Singla, Kumbakumba, & Aboud, 2015; Rahman et al., 2013). Together, this evidence suggests a promising path to protect early childhood development in contexts of extreme adversity through the attention to their caregivers. 
Semillas de Apego seeks to promote healthy child-parent attachments as a pathway for a proper development among children exposed to violence. By fostering caregivers’ mental health and their capacity to become a source of emotional protection, the intervention helps children reach their full potential amid such traumatic circumstances. Delivered over 15 weekly group sessions, program first provides tools so that victimized caregivers can start processing their own trauma. Then, the program focuses on allowing a proper understanding of the child’s development trajectories and how they affected by the experience of adversities (such as violence exposure). Finally, it aims to foster positive child-rearing practices. Taken together, Semillas de Apego’s curriculum seeks to promote maternal mental health and the healthy child-parent attachments that translate into appropriate affect regulation and healthy emotional development in the midst of adverse circumstances.
The current trial will be conducted in Tumaco, a municipality in Colombia heavily affected by violence and poverty. Over a time-span of 23 months, we will follow the implementation of Semillas de Apego with 40 groups of 16 participants each, all of them mothers or primary caregivers of children 2 to 5. This will allow us to reach a total of 640 participants and their children. The impact evaluation will be based on a cluster- randomized control trial in which we will assign  eligible subjects, nested within 18 child development centers, to either an intervention arm or a control group. The former group will participate in 15 group-led session over the period of 3 months; the latter will continue to have access to the regular early childhood programs offered through the centers to which children are affiliated. Data will be collected at baseline and two follow-ups: 1 and 12 months after the implementation has concluded. We hypothesize that the program will have a positive and sequential impact on the following dimensions: (i) primary caregiver’s mental health, (ii) child rearing practices, (iii) quality of child-parent emotional bond, (iv) children’s mental health, and (v) children’s cognitive and socioemotional development.
