abstract: "This study investigates how we can encourage high school students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds to apply for government scholarships. We conduct this study in 31 high schools in one city in Indonesia. The Indonesian government provides a generous scholarship to university students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. This scholarship covers both tuition and living cost for the entire length of the students' study. From previous studies we found that many students who were eligible for the scholarship did not apply for the scholarship. In this study we aim to find out why by testing an intervention that provides motivation and information about the scholarship during the last year of high school. We randomly allocate 1256 economically disadvantaged students to the treatment group and the control group. The intervention involves playing a short motivational and informational video and a question and answer session. We measure students' motivation and knowledge about the scholarship a few weeks after the intervention and we also track whether the students apply for the scholarship by the application deadline of the scholarship.
