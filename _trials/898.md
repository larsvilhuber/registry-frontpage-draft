abstract: "
Aim:: Regarding traditional use of Boswellia serrata gum resin and known pharmacological effects of this gum in diabetes, we evaluated anti-hyperglycemic and lipid lowering effects of Boswellia serrata gum resin in type 2 diabetic patients in a double blind randomized placebo-control trial.
Methods and materials: Fifty six diabetic patients were randomly allocated to two groups who received the boswellia serrata gum resin or placebo capsule.  The fasting blood sugar (FBS), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) as primary outcome measures and total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglyceride and insulin level as secondary outcome measures were  measured before and 8 weeks after the intervention.
