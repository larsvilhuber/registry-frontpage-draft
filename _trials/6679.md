abstract: "Sufficient voter turnout is a desirable property of a healthy democratic system. Unfortunately, historical data show that a sizable portion of the eligible electorate tends to abstain. This project aims to increase voter turnout by leveraging important insights from personal and social psychology and behavioral economics. 
The main idea is to modify the current vote counting rule in the following manner: uncast votes are not ignored but rather, randomly allocated to the alternatives. We hypothesize that this intervention will prompt people to turn out to vote to avoid having their votes misused or misallocated by the random mechanism. The intervention does not restrict voters' freedom (as opposed to, e.g., obligatory voting) and would be easy to implement in real life. We test the effectiveness of the proposed intervention both in the field  (U.S. presidential elections) and in the laboratory experiments in Switzerland."
