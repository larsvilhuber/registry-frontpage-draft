abstract: "We use Sen’s capability approach to identify factors able to increase the effective freedom of working parents when deciding the length of their parental leave. We conducted factorial survey experiment (FSE) with a Spanish sample of employees aged between 25 and 45. Respondents were asked to imagine that they were first time parents and several descriptions of hypothetical situations or vignettes (where aspects of the leave system, workplace and family environment were randomly varied) were presented to them. Then they are asked to inform about the total number of weeks they would be on parental leave under each hypothetical situation.

The experimental dimensions (or factors) were: Statutory length of paid leave (17, 22 or 26 weeks), high replacement rate, job security, earning lower income than my partner, leave does not harm colleagues, leave does not harm promotion, peers role model inside firm in using parental leaves, and easy application for parental leave. 

Our goal was to identify the causal effect of these experimental dimensions on their decisions about the total number of weeks they would be on parental leave.
