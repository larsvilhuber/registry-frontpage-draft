abstract: "This study evaluates the impact of a Peruvian Ministry of Education pilot program in the Lima metropolitan area that aimed to increase parental involvement in the education of their elementary students. Parents receive regular informational text messages along with behavioral-based prompts: either planning prompts or encouragement to make an immediate time investment. Prior to the intervention, teachers provide a list of students who they think would benefit most from such an intervention. This study focuses on effects on students' grades and standardized test scores, as well as how these effects differ with respect to teacher targeting. The goal is to understand not just the potential impacts of a scalable parental engagement program at the elementary school level, but also whether teachers have useful private knowledge about which students would benefit most from such interventions.
