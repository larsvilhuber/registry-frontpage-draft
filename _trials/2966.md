abstract: "The focus of this paper is to examine how the financial incentives emanating from insurance compare with the influence of other behavioral motivations for investing in flood risk reduction. The online lab-in-the-field experiment among homeowners in floodplains (N=2000) will demonstrate the effects of individual characteristics on risk mitigation decisions of relevant decision-makers. The expected results can be used to inform policy makers and insurance companies about how to stimulate people who voluntarily have flood insurance coverage to better prepare for flood disasters."
