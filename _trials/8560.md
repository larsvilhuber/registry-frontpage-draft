abstract: "With the rapid increase in access to mobile phones, there is an increasing effort among governments and policymakers to provide timely and customized agricultural information via mobile phones. However, rigorous evidence on how and for whom such interventions work is still limited. This study aims to understand whether and how agricultural extension delivered via mobile phones increases the agricultural productivity and profitability of smallholder farmers. The research is motivated by the large and persistent yield gap that exists among poor farmers in developing countries. We plan to examine this question using a large-scale randomized controlled trial over a two-year period in one state of India. Moreover, this study will test low-cost approaches to measuring yields. Specifically, it will assess the feasibility of using satellite images to estimate farmersâ€™ rice yields in an eastern state of India. This work will help address a common empirical challenge of evaluating digital extension and other agricultural interventions."
