abstract: "Growing up and living in disadvantaged urban neighborhoods can cause toxic stress, which can have lasting adverse effects on student academic and behavioral outcomes. To address the harmful effects of stress caused by chronic exposure to violence and poverty, we propose an evaluation of Quiet Time, an in-school meditation program. Quiet Time (QT) gives students training in Transcendental Meditation and the time to practice it during two 15-minute periods during the school day, giving young people the tools and time to reset amidst the constant stress of their everyday lives. We hypothesize that teaching students to meditate and giving them the space to do so during each school day will lead to improvements in educational outcomes and behavior inside and outside of the classroom. Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in six public high schools in Chicago, we aim to determine the effects of the QT program as measured by academic achievement and school engagement and behaviors in and out of school.
