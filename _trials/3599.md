abstract: "In order to improve the quality of care, all regions in Sweden have implemented systems where individuals choose their primary health care provider. All providers are financed by public means and pre-set user fees, but may be privately or publicly run. For consumer choice systems to improve the functioning of health care, users must choose units that deliver care of relatively high quality. Demand side frictions related to switching present a possible obstacle to the functioning of this market: the gathering of information about and comparison of providers is costly in terms of time, and there are also small process costs related to notifying providers of the change. We study the effects of two interventions using two randomly drawn samples of the population in the region of Skåne. The first sample is representative of the adult population in the region (above 18 years of age in February 4th 2015) and the second includes all individuals that that moved to the region between mid-February and early May 2015. The treatment groups, 10,259 individuals in the population-representative sample and 3,454 in the sample of new residents, received a leaflet designed in collaboration with the regional health care authority by postal mail. The leaflet contained comparative information on, e.g., accessibility, quality, and available services of an individual’s current primary care provider and its three geographically closest competitors. By sending information directly to consumers, the experimental treatment reduced search costs and may also have improved understanding, as the information was presented differently on the leaflets compared to information available online. 7,700 of the treated in the population-representative sample, and all treated new residents, received a pre-paid choice form together with the leaflet. The small monetary and hassle costs associated with switching were therefore reduced. In a previous study, we showed that information and reduced switching costs increased the probability of switching provider. This study concerns a longer-term follow-up of treatment effects of the intervention. Primary outcomes relate to care consumption and process quality measures in the population-representative sample. Secondary outcomes include additional care consumption variables and long-term switching of providers.
