abstract: "COVID-19 and policies to control it have adversely affected the ability of firms (especially small and informal enterprises) to operate and earn revenues. They have also affected their ability to link up and share information with other firms. In order to protect small firms from the negative effects of lockdowns, the central and state governments of India have introduced a number of schemes. One of them is the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS), which makes certain firms eligible to receive an additional top-up loan. Additionally, the government has recently changed its procedures to allow informal firms to register their businesses with the government through a simplified online procedure. We conduct a randomized text-based information intervention on a sample of 1446 small firms in India to test whether providing firms with information on the ECLGS and the new simplified registration process leads to i) increased formalization, ii) increased uptake of ECLGS, and iii) better firm outcomes. In addition, we randomly allocate some firms into Whatsapp Groups, to test whether being part of a small network of similar firms helps to alleviate the adverse circumstances due to the pandemic and its fallout.
