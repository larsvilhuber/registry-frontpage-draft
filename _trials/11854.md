abstract: "In partnership with the Australian Public Service Commission, BETA is exploring ways to increase rates of disability identification in APS agency HR systems. 
In partnership with a large Australian Public Service (APS) Agency who was planning to send reminder emails to staff to update their diversity information, BETA designed and conducted a four-arm trial to explore the effect of email reminders on diversity identification. 
This research will test four different email reminders: three different behaviorally informed emails against attention control which is standard, information only BAU email.  
Findings from this research may inform emails used in this APS agency and inform work undertaken in other APS agencies.
