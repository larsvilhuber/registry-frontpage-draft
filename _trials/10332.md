abstract: "We study how information about the wait time at poll stations affect voters' thoughts about elections. Using data from the study "Racial Disparities in Voting Wait Times: Evidence from Smartphone Data" by Chen et al. (2020), we conduct an online survey providing voters with accurate information about the ten percent longest or ten percent shortest wait times in their county during the 2016 presidential election. Importantly, we show this information in relative form, that is, in comparison to the average wait time of the subjectâ€™s state of residence. This allows us to induce different perceptions of wait times and to study their causal effects on subjective beliefs on, for example, the importance of elections."
