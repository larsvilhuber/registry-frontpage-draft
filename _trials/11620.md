abstract: "The consensus in the literature is that stunting has negative associations with cognitive achievement (Sanchez, 2017; Lopez-Boo and Canon, 2014; Outes-Leon, Sanchez and Porter, 2011; Hoddinott et al., 2011; Maluccio et al., 2009; Walker et al., 2005), educational attainment (Hoddinott et al., 2011; Martorell et al., 2009; Alderman, Hoddinott and Kinsey, 2006), long-term economic outcomes (Grantham-McGregor et al., 2007; Thomas and Strauss, 1997; Galasso and Wagstaff, 2017), and even adult physical health (Alderman, 2011). However, virtually all this evidence has been generated from observational studies (such as Dewey and Begum, 2011) with the possibility that these estimates are upward biased (in absolute value) due to the influence of unobserved confounders such as parental choices of child investment, home environment, and even unobserved aspects of income and wealth. Another common approach to the identification of long-run stunting impacts leverages child- or household-level shocks, however these estimates also run the risk of confounding by other child development inputs also affected by the shock. To the best of our knowledge, only one prior study (analyzed in Hoddinott, 2011 and Maluccio et al., 2009, among others) estimates the consequences of early-life stunting with the identified counterfactual inference of randomized variation. This study covered only 4 villages in Guatemala.

Building on the large-scale randomized impact evaluation of the Pantawid cash transfer program in the Philippines, this proposed study should thus contribute rigorously-identified evidence on the causal relationship of stunting, which is a widely-used indicator of childhood nutritional status, with medium-run health, cognitive, and socioemotional outcomes. This research will constitute a major piece of evidence to the (thus far nascent) experimental literature on the role that early nutrition investments or insults play in overall child development. It will also contribute to the design of better investments in productive human capital.
