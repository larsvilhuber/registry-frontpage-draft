abstract: "Paraguay has long been characterized by weak institutions, a very corrupt political class where large scale clientelism is the rule, and a low degree of public involvement, with widespread vote-buying at election time and low knowledge of- and trust in- electoral institutions. However, following the publication of information on public institutions payrolls, a number of high-profile corruption scandals involving members of Congress have recently erupted, spurring a strong public reaction contrasting with the usual apathy of citizens in the country, against both the corruption facts per se and against the widespread political culture of impunity. 
These events provide the opportunity to follow and study in real time the emergence and development of political awareness in a quite new democracy, and to experiment how different democratic institutions may allow this political awareness to translate into effective political control.
More specifically, the project will combine surveys and experiments, to study how voters in Paraguay will respond in the future to this unusual high-profile event of political corruption (our initial “shock”), focusing on the psychological mechanisms through which they process and subsequently recover information about wrongdoings by candidates, and analyzing experimentally how different electoral institutions shape voters’ ability to punish/reward politicians and/or political parties.
