abstract: "Transparency interventions frequently rely on a top-down approach in which a policymaker or external entity demands information about activity in a particular sector. Bottom-up transparency interventions differ by offering citizens the opportunity to directly initiate efforts to improve public goods or services. However, to effectively implement these initiatives, citizens need information about where and how to best target their efforts.

Questions:
● Where are the best entry points for citizen to target their efforts?
● What approaches are most effective in seeking to improve public services through
greater transparency"
