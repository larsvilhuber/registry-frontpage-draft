abstract: "The purpose of this study is to determine whether the TMW Early Childhood Educator professional development course (TMW-ECE) can improve preschool teachersâ€™ knowledge and classroom practices, and whether those improvements impact school readiness outcomes of the children in those classrooms. We will also measure potential spillover effects on the knowledge and behaviors of the parents whose children are in classrooms of teachers who have received the intervention."
