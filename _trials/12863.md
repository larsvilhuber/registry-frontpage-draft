abstract: "Can gun violence be deterred at low cost?  We report the results of a randomized experiment of a messaging intervention which was designed to reduce gun violence among individuals under parole supervision with a prior violent felony conviction or firearm arrest.  The intervention consisted of a group meeting in which high-risk paroled individuals were notified of the sanction they would face upon reoffending while being offered community resources to support re-integration into the community. The program did not lead to a reduction in gun violence or create community spillover effects but did reduce parole violations by 15%.  "
