abstract: "This pre-analysis plan outlines four groups of pre-specified hypotheses for analyzing data collected via an umbrella project referred to as ‘Her Time.’ The primary research questions relate to methodologically validating high-frequency phone surveys vis-a-vis single instance in-person surveys relying on 24-hour or 7-day recall periods that are standard in the literature. We use the cases of time use, dietary diversity and eating practices, sanitation and hygiene, and financial transactions. In addition, we test the implications for women’s time burden of a simple information treatment designed to update men’s beliefs about their peers’ acceptance of male participation in household chores. Finally, we compare women’s responses to sensitive gender norms and empowerment questions elicited via different collection methods. Data collection was originally scheduled in Amhara, Ethiopia from February 2020 - January 2021. Due to COVID-19, data collection was suspended in March 2020. It resumed in December 2020 and will be completed by November 2021."
