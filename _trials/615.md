abstract: "In collaboration with Vitality/Discovery, we will conduct an RCT among Vitalitydrive customers. We will compare the effectiveness of fixed vs. contingent incentives, feedback vs. no feedback on driving quality, and simple vs. complex feedback formats. To inform the trial, we will also conduct secondary analyses of existing Vitalitydrive client data. We will randomize a stream of new Vitalitydrive customers who elect to install the DQ-Track device to one of three arms. We interpret differences in driver behavior across these arms as evidence for the role of played by incentives and feedback on driver risk-taking."
