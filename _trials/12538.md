abstract: "This study experimentally explores public good production levels, and the endogenous formation of network structures to facilitate output sharing, among agents with homogenous production costs and valuations. This study is an complementary study of "ENDOGENOUS NETWORK FORMATION IN LOCAL PUBLIC GOODS:
AN EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS" in which we studied agents with heterogeneous production costs or valuations in the same decision context."
