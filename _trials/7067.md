abstract: "Aflatoxin poses a threat to food safety throughout sub-Saharan Africa and the developing world. Aflatoxin-producing fungi contaminate maize, a staple food, during the entire production process. A potential way for smallholder farmers to avoid food contamination is to adopt good production practices. In this study we identify the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two agricultural inputs intended for reduction of aflatoxin levels in Kenyan smallholder farmers’ crops, considering pathways of contamination. We estimate the effect of these inputs by employing a randomized controlled trial with a control group and three treatment arms: (T1) new biocontrol agent Aflasafe used as a pre-harvest input; (T2) a tarp used post-harvest for maize drying; (T3) the combination of pre- and post-harvest inputs. Moreover, we study the impact of gendered allocation of pre- and post-harvest inputs on their effectiveness in reducing aflatoxin levels in maize."
