abstract: "We conduct a survey experiment on representative samples from 41 countries that seeks to measure gender discrimination by asking participants to recommend wages for hypothetical job candidates. We then decompose discrimination into Explicit and Implicit components, and relate them to cross-country measures of development and gender inequality."
