abstract: "In this field experiment, we provide unemployed job seekers with additional information about online job search at the start of their unemployment spell. This is done in two stages. First, we provide encouragement to search actively. Second, we integrate a nudge for job seeker towards using the online job portal provided by the public employment service. Job seekers are tracked for up to 12 months. During this time, we will monitor search behavior on the platform as well as administrative records of job seekers and their job finding rates. This will give us greater insight into remaining barriers towards the use of online platforms in job search and how cost-effective nudges in communication may help lower them. Moreover, this information allows us to measure the impact of search online on the job finding rates for the treated job seekers.  "
