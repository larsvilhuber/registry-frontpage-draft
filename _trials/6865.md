abstract: "Recently spectator designs have become a popular tool in a variety of different fields of experimental economics. Examples include repugnance, ethics, cooperation, privacy and paternalism. In such experiments third parties serve as observers, judges, punishers or choice architects. In this project we are investigating how roles affect behavior. Do first- and third-parties react differently to norm information? Do first- and third-parties differ in the type of norm (i.e. injunctive or descriptive) they choose to acquire and follow?"
