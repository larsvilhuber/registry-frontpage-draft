abstract: "Forming beliefs about the world (whether using formal statistical procedures or more generally) usually requires simplifying assumptions. Unfortunately, it is often cognitively costly or even impossible to consider how all possible assumptions would affect the relevant beliefs. We develop a formal model of individuals who properly recognize uncertainty conditional on the assumptions they make (``within-model uncertainty''), but do not recognize how their assumptions affect their beliefs (``across-model uncertainty''). The model's main result is that this leads to overprecision, in the sense of having too low a subjective variance relative to the truth and to the true mean square error of predictions. Making assumptions can also generate disagreement among those with the same information. Further, if assumptions are drawn independently from the correct distribution the amount of disagreement is exactly equal to the amount of overprecision. This study explores these predictions in an experiment that varies within-model and across-model uncertainty. "
