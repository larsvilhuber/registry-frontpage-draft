abstract: "We conduct a field experiment within the chatbot of a mobile app of a fintech. The goal is to examine the effect of financial education and a financial health score on consumer financial behavior. Experiment participants will be randomly assigned to three groups on an individual level.

Participants in the control group neither receive financial education nor a financial health score. The first treatment group receives financial education. More specifically participants are educated about a standard budgeting rule and how to use the apps' personal financial management features to implement it. The second treatment group receives identical financial education but is further provided with their individual subjective financial health score. Thereby, the financial health score is calculated based on the participant's answers to five questions on their finances. With this experiment we want to answer two research questions: First, is financial education within a chatbot effective? Second, does a financial health score amplify the effect of financial education? 

To investigate the research questions, we examine several outcomes and compare them among the different groups. More specifically, we measure the adoption of personal financial management features within the app as well as the spending and saving behavior of the participants. Our first hypothesis is that participants in the first treatment group have a higher adoption of personal financial management features and spend less/ save more as compared to the control group. Our second hypothesis is that the provision of an individual financial health score in the second treatment group further amplifies these effects.
