abstract: "We study the impact of two interventions on consumer switching in the retail electricity market in Denmark. We look at actual switching behavior, switching intentions and the intention-behavior gap. We also collect data on participants’ preferences, savings-beliefs, and knowledge of the electricity market.
Our aim is to investigate 1) what interventions work to get people to consider/switch their electricity provider, 2) what interventions work on different type of people, and what this means for future policy initiatives, 3) whether and how self-reported switching intentions differ from actual switching behavior, 4) how participants feel about outsourcing the switching to a provider, and 5) if participants are prone to procrastination when it comes to switching providers.  
To address our research questions, we conduct an online survey with a working-age representative sample of the Danish population. In the survey, we first collect basic demographics which we use to display targeted information. We then measure knowledge about electricity contracts, preferences for contracts, past switching behavior and market perception.
Participants are then randomly allocated to an intervention. Next, we measure participants’ intentions to switch electricity provider. The survey also includes questions designed to elicit cognitive certainty. We track whether participant engage with the provided information. Lastly, we use administrative data to examine whether people did or did not switch electricity provider.
