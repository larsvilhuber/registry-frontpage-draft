abstract: "This study involves an online lab-style experiment in which participants will solve a search task 10 times. They search for wage offers by deciding on the reservation wage (minimum acceptable offer). Then, a computer randomly draws an offer from a known wage distribution. The offer may or may not be accepted by the participant depending on the value of the offer and the reservation wage. This is repeated until the participant accepts an offer or the search round is over. 

We study in this context, how individuals advise each other about the choice of reservation wage. In treatment 1, individuals participate in the 10 rounds of search, after which they leave advice to a random participant of treatment 2. The advice consists of a recommended reservation wage and a free-form text message. Participants of treatment 2 will see the advice at the beginning of the experiment and then participate in the 10 rounds of search task. The payment of the participants in treatment 1 will be influenced by the search task of the participants in treatment 2 in order to give incentives for leaving meaningful advice.
We study what sort of advice individuals leave to their peers and how that influences the peers' decisions in treatment 2. In particular, we are interested in whether receiving advice from an experienced decision-maker will improve decisions in the search task in the sense that individuals choose a reservation wage closer to the optimal value.

We will have two types of settings, one without search costs and one with search costs, in which participants receive offers only after finishing a coding task. This means we will have two versions of treatment 1 and two versions of treatment 2.
