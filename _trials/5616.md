abstract: "This study will use a survey experiment to test the importance of production (efficiency) and process (equity and ethos of public employees) performance for political trust. The survey is fielded during the third week of school closures and other quarantine measures in Denmark (March 30th-April 6th) due to the coronavirus (covid-19). The survey experiment consist of seven groups: one control group and six treatment groups. The six treatment groups are presented with different information in the form of a headline about the current status on the coronavirus in Denmark. The aim of the survey experiment is to test whether political trust and satisfaction with the governmentâ€™s effort toward coronavirus is affect by production performance outcomes (fatality rate and costs) and process performance (equity and ethos of public employee and the prime minister)."
