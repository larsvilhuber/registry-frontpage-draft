abstract: "This study is a randomized evaluation on the impact of implementing a high-tech and high-touch intervention in public junior high schools in Indonesia. In the high-tech intervention, randomly selected seventh-grade students from 150 selected schools will use a computer-adaptive learning (CAL) software to practice and strengthen their foundational mathematics skills. In the high-touch intervention, seventh-grade math teachers will receive a series of trainings to improve the students’ higher order thinking skills. The intervention will be implemented over one school year. The study will evaluate the impact of the intervention on student learning outcomes.
