abstract: "The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a large increase in unemployment, which is likely to leave many low-income households unable to pay for housing. In response, the City of Chicago Department of Housing (DOH) partnered with UpTogether (formerly the Family Independence Initiative) to launch the COVID-19 Housing Assistance Grant, which provided over 1,600 unconditional grants of $1,000 to Chicagoans. This initiative was unprecedented for DOH and was seen as a model by other cities. Because grants were administered via an open lottery, this program offers an opportunity to learn about the impact of the grants.

The City of Chicago also partnered with The Resurrection Project (TRP) to create the Chicago Resiliency Fund, which offered $5 million in unconditional grants of $1,000 each to impacted individuals across Chicago who did not receive a CARES Act check from the federal government. Because TRP allocated funding for some of the grants through an open application and lottery, this program offers the opportunity to generate rigorous evidence about the impact of this grant on socioeconomic outcomes.

The Inclusive Economy Lab has partnered with DOH, UpTogether, and TRP to better understand the impact of the programs on formal eviction, homeless shelter entry, hospitalization, and build-up of rental arrears and other debt. "
