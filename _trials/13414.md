abstract: "Following a successful pilot study (AEARCTR-0006390), the California Policy Lab will evaluate the impact of the Santa Clara County Public Defender’s Office’s Pre-Arraignment Representation & Review Team (PARR) during the expansion and scale-up of the program on pre-trial detention, release at arraignment, and case outcomes, and longer term recidivism outcomes. The study will use a random process to assign legal staff to clients who are booked on felony charges and not released within 24 hours of booking. Specifically, using a pre-determined schedule, legal staff will provide PARR services to clients booked 6 days per week, rotating the 7th day across days of the week over the study period."
