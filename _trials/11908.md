abstract: "The goal of preschool education is to support children’s cognitive, physical, and socio-emotional development, providing a safe and nurturing environment for young children to learn and interact with their peers. However, estimates indicate that 250 million children (43%) younger than 5 years in low- and middle-income countries are at risk of not reaching their developmental potential due, in part, due to inadequate and inequitable access to preschools. In Ecuador, 60% of the children aged 3 to 4 years old remained unenrolled in 2020-21. Recognising the lack of access to public preschools and additionally the lack of motivation among parents to send their child to preschools, the Ecuadorian Ministry of Education (MoE) launched a programme to provide regular home visits to ‘vulnerable’ families in 2018. In our study we collaborate with the MoE to improve the quality of this programme through professional development, technology-aided monitoring, and support for both teachers and parents. The evaluation will test if these programme improvements lead to an increase in child development outcomes using a cluster randomised control trial."
