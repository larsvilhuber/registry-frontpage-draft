abstract: "The District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) partnered with the Flamboyan Foundation to implement the Family Engagement Partnership (FEP), a two-year school-based intervention that aims to increase family engagement and, ultimately, student achievement. As part of this effort, DCPS selected Mathematica Policy Research, a nonpartisan research firm, to serve as the independent evaluator of FEP. Mathematica conducted a randomized controlled trial with a multi-step screening process to estimate the impacts of FEP on family engagement, student achievement, and other key outcomes. The treatment in this intent-to-treat evaluation was the invitation to apply to FEP, not necessarily the implementation of FEP. In addition to using administrative data to measure student and teacher outcomes, we planned to develop and administer surveys to assess family engagement activities and outcomes. Teacher surveys conducted in spring 2015, spring 2016, and spring 2018 would allow us to examine whether FEP activities differ from usual practices in control schools and estimate impacts on teacher satisfaction and perceptions of student-teacher relationships. We planned to conduct a parent survey in summer 2016 and summer 2018 to measure family engagement outcomes from the parents’ perspective. Findings were to be presented in a 2019 report. However, the study sponsors decided to end the evaluation early due to statistical power considerations. Preliminary findings from this evaluation and another study’s recent findings suggested that impacts of the intervention may be difficult to detect in part because they may be modest in size and not statistically significant with the sample of schools participating in the study."
