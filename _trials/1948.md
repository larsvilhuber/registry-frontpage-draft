abstract: "This study seeks to estimate the effects of completing an apprenticeship on labor market and other outcomes in Ghana. It includes three nested randomizations, the first of which randomly offered applicants entry into an apprenticeship coordinated by the National Apprenticeship Program (NAP). The second randomization placed treatment applicants from the first randomization with interested firms, conditional on applicant interest and geographic feasibility. This design allows us to experimentally explore how outcomes vary with firm characteristics. The third assigned a random half of training NAP apprentices from the second randomization to a program which provided cash incentives to firm owners conditional on apprentice performance on a skills test.
