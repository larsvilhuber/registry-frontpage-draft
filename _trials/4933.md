abstract: "Access to employment is widely known to improve economic and social outcomes for individuals, and more recently, there is clear evidence that mobile money has improved households' welfare in developing countries.  In Bangladesh, women lag behind men in participation in both labor and mobile money markets.  Only 26 percent of women in Bangladesh participate in the labor force, and employers express strong reservations about hiring women.  Only 10 percent of women, compared to 32 percent of men, had a mobile money account in 2017, and only a very small share of mobile money agents are women.  Hiring women as mobile money agents offers an opportunity to increase economic opportunities for women and change social attitudes towards women's labor force participation for those who interact with them.  Female mobile money agents may also increase access to mobile money for female customers.  We will implement a randomized controlled trial to measure the economic and social effects of employing women as mobile money agents.  On the supply side, we will increase the number of women working as mobile money agents by randomly assigning subsidies to 500 shops for hiring male or female employees.  On the demand side, we will randomize the digitization of microloan repayments at 90 BRAC branches, which increases the demand for mobile money by female customers, but may be hampered by discomfort transacting with men.  The cross-randomization of these interventions lets us test for economic and social complementarities between women's participation on the supply and demand sides of the market for mobile money."
