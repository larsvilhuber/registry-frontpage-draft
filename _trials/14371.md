abstract: "This study aims to assess the impact of a parental stimulation intervention on early childhood development (ECD) and parenting environments among migrant populations in China. The intervention addresses a critical gap, as up to 43% of children under five in low- and middle-income countries, including migrant children in China, are at risk of developmental delays due to factors such as low socioeconomic status and limited access to public services. Using a stepped-wedge trial design, 300 caregiver-child dyads (children aged 6-30 months) living in Foxconn's campus in Zhengzhou will participate. The intervention consists of weekly one-on-one parental training sessions, adapted from the Reach Up and Learn curriculum. Outcomes, including child development and parental investment, will be measured at baseline and at 2-month intervals. The primary hypotheses are that the intervention will improve childrenâ€™s cognitive, language, motor, and social-emotional development, enhance parenting skills and investments, and positively affect employee well-being, job satisfaction, and retention. With 80% power to detect a 0.25 standard deviation improvement in cognitive scores, this study has the potential to provide key insights into scalable interventions for vulnerable migrant populations."
