abstract: "Despite the high returns to education, private investment among many students remains remarkably low. That the present long-term returns do not motivate students enough to invest effort during learning is one explanation for this puzzle. Given the increasing body of evidence implying non-cognitive skills to play an equally important role for education investments as cognitive skills, this study examines an incentive scheme through which students’ learning experience is expected to enhance, i.e., example choice, an instructional approach that offers students a choice between predefined contexts for an academic topic, which are related to their out-of-school interests. To establish our results, we conducted a field experiment in the seventh and eighth grade of Flemish secondary education involving 1,460 students in 31 schools. We hypothesise that modifying learning material to draw on students’ interests not only improves the interest in the topic, but also the academic performance of students."
