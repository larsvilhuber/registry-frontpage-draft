abstract: "This experiment tests what influences the linking decisions between individuals through job referrals, and whether these social job networks are formed strategically. I randomly generate job opportunities for young job seekers from dense urban neighbourhoods in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Some participants are enabled to refer individuals from their neighbourhood to the same job, and I repeat this experiment for several rounds. Explanatory variables of interest are various referral treatment indicators, various measures of participants' network centrality, as well as dyadic characteristics of two individuals in the social networks. Outcomes of interest are a variety of characteristics of the referred worker, of referral indicators between two individuals, as well as on-the-job performance of the referred worker."
