abstract: "This study explores how varying the information conveyed in a descriptive social norm intervention influences participants' willingness to become advocates for a charity. Some participants are allocated to a control condition that is not shown a social norm, while others are allocated to conditions where they are told that they have been matched with 10 other participants, and are randomly told that 0, 2, 5, 8, or 10 of those they were matched with chose to become advocates. The main outcome of interest is whether participants indicate that they would like to sign up to become an advocate for the charity. Secondary outcomes include whether they felt bad for the charity because too few signed up and the perceived efficacy associated with becoming an advocate. In addition to randomly being allocated to conditions with different norm levels, participants are also either told that their decision will be kept confidential or that we may share their decision with the charity (so that they could contact them).
