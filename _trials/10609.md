abstract: "I conduct a field experiment to assess the effect of business location for microentrepreneurs. I relieve liquidity and information constraints (separately, and simultaneously) on business mobility and measure the effect on business outcomes. I investigate whether relieving these constraints enables business owners to move to parts of the city that are on average more profitable than their current locations and whether they realize income gains upon relocation. Specifically, the experiment randomly allocates conditional and unconditional cash grants of equivalent value, where the conditional grant is available to those microentrepreneurs moving from their current business locations to alternative locations. Both the conditional and unconditional cash treatment will be cross-randomized with an information treatment that provides business owners with information about city parishes that are on average more profitable than their own."
