abstract: "In this paper, I design and implement a series of tests of the level-k model of auctions. I begin by studying which (simple) environments can best disentangle the level-k model from its leading rival, Bayes-Nash equilibrium. I then implement these environments in the (virtual) laboratory to see which theory, if either, can explain the observed bidding behaviour."
