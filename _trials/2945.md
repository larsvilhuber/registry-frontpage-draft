abstract: "Gender disparities in STEM fields remain large and systematic. In this study, set in the context of developing country, we will use a randomized control trial to study the effects of role models on the decisions of high school students to choose STEM fields as their choice of major in college. Our treatment involves short talks provided by female students currently enrolled in STEM majors in some selected high schools, whereas other schools act as the control group. These talks will provide students information about engineering as a career, as well as discuss the experiences of women in STEM classrooms. Our primary outcome of interest is the enrollment decisions made by students."
