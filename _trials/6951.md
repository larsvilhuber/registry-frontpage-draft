abstract: "We explore the prevalence of risk attitude reversals for experienced producers. Prior literature has identified a discrepancy in risk attitudes between comparing and pricing lotteries. Specifically, on average, individuals appear to be more risk-neutral when pricing lotteries and risk-averse when comparing lotteries. Our study elicits certainty equivalents and probability equivalent using choice lists--a pricing and a comparing task. To explore the generalizability of this discrepancy of risk attitudes across contexts, we study experts' behavior and choices with substantial incentives.Â "
