abstract: "The Lean Season Grant (LSG) Project studies the ways in which seasonality in income leads to costly income- and consumption-smoothing behavior among rural low-income households in Ghana, an whether a “graduation” anti-poverty program shapes the subsequent investment decisions of these individuals when they receive an additional transfer of capital. In particular, our Trial Registry involves two sets of analyses we intend to conduct through an experiment conducted in Ghana.

In the first paper, “Understanding Lean Season Behavior”, we will study whether seasonal variation in income causes households to prioritize labor and production decisions oriented towards earning immediate cash in the lean season, and away from activities more likely to maximize longer-term profits. Similarly, we will test whether households make consumption decisions in the lean season that imply either a high discount rate or some set of constraints that prevents them from smoothing consumption between the period immediately after the harvest and the lean season. 

In a second paper, we are measuring the long-run impacts to a graduation program, in which households received a transfer of productive assets and training. As part of this paper, we will include a section on “Graduation and the Returns to Capital,” in which we will test whether or not having previously received the graduation program subsequently affected how individuals used a subsequent transfer of capital. For example, to the extent there are non-convexities in investments, graduation treatment households might be above some threshold at which they are better able to use subsequent funds, or the graduation program might have strengthened individuals’ skills and/or their beliefs in their own abilities.
