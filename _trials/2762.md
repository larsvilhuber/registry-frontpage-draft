abstract: "In South Carolina, the Medicaid program is administered through Managed Care Organizations (MCOs), which offer different health care plans to Medicaid beneficiaries. These plans differ in their generosity, network coverage, and other attributes, and they are evaluated by the state using a system of "star ratings." Starting in 2017, when consumers do not make an active plan choice, the state assigns a plan automatically using an explicitly random process. We use this auto-assignment feature to study the effect of plan assignment on patient outcomes, such as health care utilization and health care expenditures."
