abstract: "Laboratory experiments on privacy decision-making can provide complementary insights to surveys and field experiments, but they raise the methodological challenge of how to induce value for data in an artificial environment. To this end, we run three experimental studies and benchmark different design parameters regarding data valuation. Specifically, (i) we elicit participantsâ€™ willingness-to-accept the disclosure of different data types in the laboratory, (ii) we benchmark different elicitation methods, and (iii) we investigate the impact of information uncertainty by varying feedback provided to participants before they submit their valuation."
