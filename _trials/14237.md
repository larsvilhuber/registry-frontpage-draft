abstract: "This research project aims to investigate the impact of team diversity on performance. Previous studies have made use a single task with a single measure of performance. This project seeks to exploit publicly posted data from a series of (upcoming) business competitions spanning multiple continents, where participants are randomly assigned to teams competing on a range of tasks (marketing, accounting, logistics/operations, business intelligence, organizational behavior). Teams can be different by gender composition, as well as information/knowledge that they can access before a task. Teams diverse in different ways can confer performance benefits for some tasks and not others, sometimes even creating a disadvantage for the teams when solving a tasks requiring coordination (Schelling game). Furthermore, team diversity can lead to vastly different performance when the scoring system changes (for the business intelligence task). When teams were given agency over the choice of scoring systems, diverse team elect systems (and hence tasks) that allow for more returns to diversity while non-diverse teams elect systems that yield low/negative returns to diversity."
