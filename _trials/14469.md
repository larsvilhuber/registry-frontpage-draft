abstract: "In this study, we will investigate differences in individuals’ willingness to pay for artwork which is either human- or AI- created. First, using an online survey experiment, we will identify a candidate sample of images, spanning a range of artistic styles, which are statistically indistinguishable in terms of humans’ judgement about whether they are created by a human artist or AI program. Then, we will use laboratory experiment auctions to compare incentivized valuations for human- versus AI- created artwork."
