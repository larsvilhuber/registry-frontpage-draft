abstract: "Chronic malnutrition is a persistent and urgent challenge in the rural, mountainous, and mostly indigenous area of Chimborazo, Ecuador.  In the Chimborazo province, 49 percent of children under five were stunted in 2013 (ENSANUT).  This experiment tests how behavior change can play a role in improving indicators of child nutrition.  Caregivers in both rural and urban areas enrolled in the Texting for Nutrition Program led by the World Bank and the Provincial Government of Chimborazo.  A randomly selected subset of enrolled caregivers received biweekly text messages that encouraged specific types of caregiver behavior change.  Each set of behaviors were designed to improve child nutrition through a different behavioral mechanism: increased attendance to health checkups, increased consumption of micronutrients, improved diet diversity, or improved water sanitation and hygiene practices.    We will test whether the text messages affected caregiver behaviors and improved nutrition outcomes for children.   We will also be able to test which behavioral channels were more effective because the thematic area of text messages received by caregivers was randomly assigned at the individual level, allowing for a comparison across text message treatment arms.
