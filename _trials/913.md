abstract: "While an increasing number of low-income households in developing countries has access to a formal bank account, there are many barriers that prevent households from accessing a wider range of welfare-enhancing financial products and services. Although technically “banked”, these individuals often find the formal financial sector daunting and complicated and fail to actively engage with it. As a result, they are not able to fully utilize the facilities it offers and more importantly, they are unable to use the formal financial sector as a mechanism to meet their financial goals. In this project, we examine how workers learn about a new financial product being offered as an add-on to a basic salary account and examine the mechanisms that drive the adoption decision. We partner with a leading bank in Bangladesh and offer a simple "Deposit Pension Savings" (DPS) product to salaried workers in the garment sector in Bangladesh who already have an electronic payroll account. Workers are given the option to enroll in the DPS plan and commit to having a fixed savings amount debited from their monthly salary. We vary the conditions under which the product is presented to eligible workers and study to what extent the adoption decision is driven by learning about the product versus the desire on the worker's part to convey information to the employer."
