abstract: "Objective: Current study aimed to investigate the effect of various mood conditions (Sad, Neutral & Laughter) on the cognitive abilities of Graduate and Under-graduate  students.
 Method: A 1-session, five trial (pre, post 1 post 2 post 3 post 4) , double-blind, within group design, randomised controlled trial was used for the current experiment. Throughout the session of five trails, three mood condition have been administered step by step after completing International Positive and Negative affect Schedule (I-PANAS-SF), Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA) to examine the effect of various mood on affect and cognitive process. Three mood condition Sad, Neutral & Laughter were performed on Graduate and Under graduate students (N=77), each with a double blind, crossover within design assessing  the extent to which  Sad, Neutral and Laughter  can sway  affect and cognitive process along its domains.
Results: Repeated measure ANOVA were performed, Findings of current study revealed that the participants were shown vulnerably on cognition and affect when sadness was induced. Furthermore, results further revealed that laughter had the significant positive effect on the cognitive process along its domains. Mood (F=58.49, p=.000, η2 =.38) Cognition (F= 235.56, p=.000, η2 =.71) executive functioning (F=67.62, p=.000, η2=.42), language (F=40.24, p=.000, η2=.30), visual spatial (F=43.91, p=.000, η2=.32), attention, concentration and working memory (F=102.5, p=.000, η2=.523).
Conclusions: results concluded that mood either positive or negative have profound effect on cognition and laughter could be the most beneficial intervention to improve both affect and cognition."
