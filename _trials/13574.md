abstract: "This study conducts a field experiment to investigate the extent of ethnic discrimination in the formation of personal social networks and the role of visual stereotypes. We study the effect of ethnicity on the acceptance rate of friend or follower requests and the extent to which visual stereotypes moderate this effect. Therefore, we use fictitious social media profiles created on the social networking site Instagram with either Turkish- or German-sounding male names and pictures that either signal visual stereotypes, such as religious beliefs and cultural orientation, or do not. The social media profiles are based on previous research (AEARCTR-0011322) in which we conducted a field experiment in the market for shared housing to investigate the effect of ethnicity and visual stereotypes on the probability of receiving an invitation to view a room in a shared apartment and meet potential roommates. In this follow-up experiment, we aim to investigate a potential determinant of ethnic discrimination: the formation of personal social networks, which may indicate an initial hurdle to integration in housing and other markets. Therefore, we collect suggestions for friends or contacts to follow made by the social networking platform. We then send friend or follower requests to these users and measure the rate of acceptance. Additionally, we observe whether users re-follow the fictitious profile to shed light on ethnic discrimination in personal social network formation and the role of visual stereotypes."
