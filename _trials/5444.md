abstract: "This is a follow-up study of the registered experiment “Early Childhood Development in the Slums of Cuttack, Odisha, India” (AEARCTR-0000169). The intervention that was randomized across 54 slums, consisted on weekly home visits delivered by local women and targeting children between 10 and 20 months old during 18 months. Evidence from the first follow up reported positive effects in cognition (0.35 SD), receptive language (0.25 SD) and expressive language (0.20 SD). Yet, effects were larger for boys (cognition: 0.45 SD, receptive language: 0.45 SD and expressive language: 0.51 SD).One of the objectives of this project is to estimate long run impacts six years after the intervention, i.e., when children are between 6 and 8 years old. A second objective is to estimate spillover effects on siblings younger than 16 years old. Finally, we would like to understand intra-household allocation of resources in this context.  We aim to follow the initial sample of 421 target children and their families. There is still a set of outstanding questions in the literature about whether or not impacts of very early interventions are sustained and which interventions are the ones leading to longer-run impacts.  One of the aims of the current study is to examine whether the intervention had sustained impacts on child development six years after the randomization and to quantify them. Also, we would like to test whether there are spillover effects of the intervention on developmental outcomes of siblings of the original study children.  Similarly we would like to examine intrahousehold allocation of resources of study households and their neighbours."
