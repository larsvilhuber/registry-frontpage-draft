abstract: "Expanding small-scale interventions without lowering quality and attenuating impact is a critical policy challenge. Community monitoring offers a low-cost mechanism to ensure quality by making service providers accountable to local citizens, rather than distant administrators. This paper evaluates the impact of a large-scale home visit parenting intervention implemented by the Nicaraguan government, with two types of monitoring: (a) institutional monitoring; and (b) community monitoring."
