abstract: "California Proposition 47 allowed individuals convicted with felonies in several categories to petition for the felony to be reduced to a misdemeanor. In one California County, the Public Defender has worked together with the DA’s office to file these petitions on behalf of defendants without their needing to take any action or even know it is happening. Despite their desire to notify individuals of these reductions, the Public Defender’s Office does not have the resources to do so. We have partnered with the County Public Defender’s Office to randomly notify defendants who have received a reduction, petitioned on their behalf by the SJ public defender. The County Public Defender’s office will use 4 methods to contact these individuals: phone calls, text messages, email and mail to their most recent addresses. We also collect publicly available data on these individual’s criminal history, and match these data to employment and earnings outcomes and credit report data. The matched labor market/criminal record data and credit history/criminal record data will allow us to determine whether knowing that a felony has been reduced has any impact on these labor market and credit outcomes compared to those who are unaware of the reduction. Data collected from this study will also teach us how to best find and communicate with people who may be particularly transient and suspicious of authority. "
