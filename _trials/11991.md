abstract: "Female labor force participation in India is among the lowest in the world and has been falling over the past three decades. Safer workplaces may help encourage more women to apply for work (Jayachandran (2020)) especially in countries like India where female labor force participation is low and where stigma related to sexual harassment is high (Borker (2017), Sharma (2022)). Sexual harassment of Women at Workplace Act 2013 (SHWA) was implemented in India to promote the provision of safety amenities at work for women. The institutional mechanisms mandated by the law could improve the perceived and actual safety of working women and their consequent labor market outcomes. In this study, we aim to understand the challenges faced by Indian firms in creating a safe workplace for women. We randomly provide two information interventions to HR managers at corporate firms on i) legal compliance guidelines of SHWA 2013 and ii) job-seeker preferences on amenities at the workplace. We then aim to analyze changes in hiring managers' beliefs on job-seeker preferences, prevalence of sexual harassment and willingness to invest in workplace safety.  One key outcome of this study will be firm's (represented by the hiring manager's) willingness to sign up and attend a workplace safety webinar organized by our partnering NGO.
