abstract: "During the follow-up data collection for a Microfinance Impact evaluation in Myanmar, we are using a hybrid approach in which we conduct both phone and in-person surveys. The aim of this study is to measure any bias that may result from surveying in person vs. via phone, using two short survey experiments. "
