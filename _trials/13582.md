abstract: "This study is a follow-up of the project “The persistent effect of biased narratives: Evidence from an online experiment”, preregistered in the AEA RCT registry (AEARCTR-0005595). The current study adds five new treatments (between subjects), plus one auxiliary treatment, to the original study to explore additional mechanisms for why narratives have persistent effects and whether the persistent effects of narratives are long-lasting."
