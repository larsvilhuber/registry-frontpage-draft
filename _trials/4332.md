abstract: "The alarming obesity rates and consequent major-chronic-diseases incidence in developing
countries have lead to numerous calls for targeted obesity prevention policies; most
interventionsâ€™ focus is Pigovian taxation. In the presence of social-image concerns, however,
the standard incentive-based taxation is not optimal and instead, norm-based interventions
might prove effective. Given the positive correlation between body mass and wealth in developing
countries, high body mass is likely to be a positive signal for socio-economic status,
yet this has never been empirically tested. This project proposes an experimental design to test whether individuals perceive body mass as a signal of socio-economic status, in low-income contexts. In the experiment, I randomly assigning photo-morphed variation of the same portrait and elicit perceived
income. To verify robustness of the findings, I investigate how the comparative statics when I experimentally reduce asymmetric information about wealth. Lastly, I investigate individuals' beliefs on returns from high body mass in dating and credit markets, as well as whether individuals with high body mass have a beauty or respect premium."
