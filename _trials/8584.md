abstract: "This study constitutes the third wave of our panel study on the role of social identity and ``groupiness'' in the demand for and processing of information using an online experiment with a representative sample of the US population. The first wave was deployed the week before the 2020 US presidential election, where 1,004 participants played a set of games and predicted both the outcomes of the 2020 presidential election and policy-sensitive statistics a year after the election conditional on its outcome. Wave 2 was conducted in January 2021, after the inauguration of President Biden. In Wave 3, we will repeat the main measurements of Wave 1 and further explore the mechanisms behind participants' biased information demand and processing uncovered in the first two waves. Specifically, participants will again play the other-other allocation games, which measure the individual ingroup bias in information demand and processing. In addition, they will be given new information processing tasks, and complete the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale."
