abstract: "Although team incentives are seen as powerful tools to leverage the power of social effects, they have rarely been used to encourage desirable behaviours outside firms. In this study, we investigate whether team incentives are more effective than equivalent individual payments to increase the demand for a preventive visit for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in El Salvador. Despite the availability of effective preventive treatments, CVDs are responsible for most deaths and disability worldwide, especially in most Latin American countries where they are a growing epidemic. Yet, in many settings, individuals with a high risk of developing a CVDs remain undiagnosed and those with established CVDs are poorly monitored. In addition to the usual financial and information barriers, behavioural biases may contribute to the low demand for preventive care as CVDs and their risk factors are often asymptomatic. In this study, we seek to increase the demand for preventive CVD check-ups by using financial incentives leveraging the power of social effects in existing networks. In partnership with a micro-finance organisation in San Salvador that offers group loans, we compare team and individual incentives conditional on attending a preventive health check-up, in two alternative designs: a small financial reward and a lottery with a chance to win a large financial prize. We also use detailed information about social networks to study the heterogeneity of effects of alternative schemes."
