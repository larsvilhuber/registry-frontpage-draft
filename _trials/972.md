abstract: "The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of planning tools on course completion and retention at a large not-for-profit online university. In particular, this research will examine whether students who complete a detailed study calendar and receive reminders about their study and course-completion plans complete more course credits and are more likely to re-enroll in courses than students who do not create a calendar or receive study reminders.  This study will also examine whether students who, in addition to creating calendars and receiving reminders, also receive follow-up from mentors experience additional academic performance.  In addition to identifying practical tools that could help online students achieve greater academic success, this study will inform whether problems with planning and memory are significant factors in poor performance in online education settings.
