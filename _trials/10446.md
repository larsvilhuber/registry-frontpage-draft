abstract: "I evaluate the preference of job seekers and employers using an incentivized resume rating (IRR), where subjects evaluate hypothetical vacancies and resumes. Employers will assess hypothetical CVs and choose the profile they would hire. Based on their elections, employers will receive three real candidates to fill vacancies. I will randomly assign an information treatment to half job seekers, showing the hiring rate of women, migration status, and living distance to the location. Job seekers will evaluate hypothetical vacancies, knowing they will receive three actual vacancies based on their assessment. "
