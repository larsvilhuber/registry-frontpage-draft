abstract: "Leaf Color Charts (LCCs) are a decision support tool to help farmers assess leaf nitrogen needs in real-time, and optimize fertilizer use, aiming to improve farm yield and profits while minimizing environmental impact. We are conducting a field experiment in Maharashtra, India, to estimate the impact of training, ex-ante vs. ex-post incentives, and conditional vs. unconditional ex-ante incentives on LCC adoption.
