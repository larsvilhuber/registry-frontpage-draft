abstract: "Mental illnesses often go undiagnosed or untreated in low-income settings. Mental health care may be especially important for the elderly - events in the lives of the elderly, like illnesses or deaths of peers, may put these individuals at high risk of mental illness. The study will constitute a randomized controlled trial aimed at reducing depression among elderly women over a 12-week period. Through two interventions, the investigators will aim to improve women elder's outlook on life and relationships through cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and facilitated group activities. There will be a total of four treatment arms: one for CBT during home visits, one for facilitated group activities, one for both, and a control group receiving neither the CBT nor facilitated group activities. All activities will be delivered by lay government community volunteers. Randomization for group activities will be at the village-level, and randomization for CBT will be at the individual-level within each village. Investigators will track outcomes of the elderly at two points in time: immediately after the 12-week intervention and 6 months after the intervention. "
