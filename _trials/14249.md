abstract: "We are interested in studying how the recall of trading narratives changes over time. In an earlier survey, which was run by a large German bank, we elicited investor recalls about their recent stock trading experiences and, in particular, the specific reasons why they traded. Now, in this follow-up survey, we are interested in studying how they recall the same trading experiences differently -- that is, how the narrative about the same trading episode changes over time.

When eliciting trading narratives, we contact the survey respondents again and remind them about the stock they traded last time. We then elicit their recalls about why they bought or sold a particular stock last time."
