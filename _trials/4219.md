abstract: "The objective of the experiment is to test a set of hypotheses derived from our perception-based model of framing. In a nutshell, we assume that each player is endowed with a particular frame (or set of frames), but can become aware of additional frames. Given this, the model defines a notion of frame-dependent rationalizability, which we use to formulate behavioral predictions in relation to exogenous (treatment-induced) variations in individuals’ awareness.
Specifically, the model considers “matching games” in which pairs of players have identical action sets (where each action is represented by a visual object), and are rewarded for choosing the same elements from these sets.  A frame may be thought of as a player’s categorization of objects (i.e., a partition of her actions) on the basis of the attributes she is aware of.  Our behavioral theory assumes that players have partial and different awareness of perceptual features (such as attributes of the objects) that may be useful for coordination.  In the experiment we exogenously manipulate individuals’ awareness, in order to test our notion of frame-dependent rationalizability."
