abstract: "Background rotator cuff tendinopathy is a significant problem among diabetics, that frequently restricts patients activity in term of pain and disability. The purpose to compare the efficacy of Astym therapy and kinesio tape in diabetic patients with chronic rotator cuff tendinopathy. Study Design: single blind randomized controlled trial .Subjects and methods 56 diabetic patients diagnosed with chronic rotator cuff tendinopathy were randomly assigned into Astym therapy group (n=28) or kinesiotaping group (n= 28) . All patients received conventional program in the form of hot backs and exercise in addition to Astym treatment or Kinesiotaping for 12 sessions (2times/week). Patients were assessed at baseline and  at the end of corresponding intervention with visual analog scale (VAS) for pain intensity,  shoulder disability questioner (SDQ) for shoulder disability,  and electrogoniometer for shoulder range of motion. Results For the 56 study participants (21 males and 35 females; mean age=41.9±6.9) years there were significant differences were detected in VAS and SDQ scores in both group when compared to baseline (p<0.05).  Between group comparison showed a significant reduction in VAS score and  SDQ score in the kinesiotaping group compared to the Astym therapy group. Range of motion measures showed no significant changes within or between groups after treatment (p > 0.05). Conclusion kinesiotaping  appears to be more effective than Astym therapy in reducing pain and shoulder disability for diabetic patients with chronic  rotator cuff tendinopathy ."
