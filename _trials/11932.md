abstract: "This experiment investigates the impact of different information interventions on vocational students' willingness to work in the manufacturing industry. In the experiment, students are randomly divided into three groups providing different information about the importance of manufacturing industry and its pecuniary rewards. Following the provision of this information, we explore studentsâ€™ intentions regarding working in the manufacturing industry, their anticipated long-term salaries, and their thoughts on the support schools can offer in preparing them for such careers. Through this study, valuable insights will be gained into the effectiveness of the information interventions in shaping students' career preferences and aspirations within the manufacturing sector."
