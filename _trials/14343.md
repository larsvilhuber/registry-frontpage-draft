abstract: "This study evaluates an innovative approach to preventing child malnutrition in rural India. The intervention combines machine learning predictions with targeted nutritional counseling to identify and support children at risk of malnutrition. The program operates in two states (Madhya Pradesh and Odisha) where the American India Foundation (AIF) already provides nutritional support services through local Anganwadi centers.
In this randomized controlled trial, we will evaluate whether using machine learning to identify high-risk children and providing their families with additional home-based counseling improves nutritional outcomes. The study includes villages randomly assigned to treatment or control groups. In treatment villages, families of children identified as high-risk will receive additional home visits and nutritional counseling. In control villages, standard nutritional services will continue as usual.
The study will measure impacts on children's nutritional status (using standard anthropometric measures) and on caregivers' knowledge and practices related to child nutrition. This will help us understand whether combining predictive analytics with targeted counseling can effectively prevent malnutrition among young children in rural India."
