abstract: "Recent survey evidence indicates a steady decline in U.S adults’ financial literacy over the past decade, in part due to a sharp increase in the selection of “don’t know” as a response choice. Are these trends driven by increased use of mobile phone data collection?  Building on descriptive, within-individual evidence from a longitudinal panel showing a strong correlation between mobile phone survey completion and DK/incorrect responses, this project will conduct a randomized experiment to examine how survey delivery methods influence estimated financial knowledge, and how survey design can improve accurate assessment.
