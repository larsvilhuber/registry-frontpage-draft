abstract: "The Wilson Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunities (LEO) at the University of Notre Dame, in partnership with the North Texas Food Bank (NTFB), is evaluating the effectiveness of automated text message reminders on increasing enrollment rates in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). This study seeks to address the barriers that individuals face during the SNAP application process, particularly the challenge of submitting required documentation to finalize their enrollment.

The study will employ a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design to assess the impact of text message reminders on increasing the rate of successful SNAP enrollment. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a treatment group, which will receive three text message reminders encouraging the completion of their application, or a control group, which will receive standard NTFB services without additional reminders. These text messages are strategically timed and available in multiple languages to accommodate participantsâ€™ preferences.

The research will explore the effects of this intervention on SNAP enrollment rates, with additional analyses of subgroups based on demographics such as age, household size, and prior use of NTFB services. With a target enrollment of 16,000 participants, this study aims to generate causal evidence on the efficacy of low-cost, scalable interventions to improve access to critical assistance. The findings will contribute to broader efforts to reduce food insecurity and enhance health outcomes through increased participation in SNAP."
