abstract: "The Office of the National Coordination of PROSPERA, the conditional cash transfer program in Mexico, is considering implementing some adjustments to the design and operation of the program in order to improve the services provided to the beneficiaries. One of the proposed interventions is the change in the high school scholarship recipient, from the mother to the beneficiary. High school beneficiaries have become particularly relevant to the program as dropout rates at this level are especially high (27.9%) . As such, one of the program priorities is to test new scholar incentives redesigns in high school. 

This intervention will be implemented as a pilot during the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 school years. The government is interested in evaluating the impact of this change in terms of dropout rates, employment, consumption and risk behaviors before scaling it up at the national level. For this purpose, we are proposing an experimental design, assigning the change in scholarship recipient to the beneficiaries enrolled in the randomly selected treatment high schools. The sample size for this experiment is 1250 high schools (625 treatment and 625 control) within 8 states (Baja California, Chiapas, Durango, Hidalgo, Mexico, Puebla, Veracruz, and Zacatecas).
