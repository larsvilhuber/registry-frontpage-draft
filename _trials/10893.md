abstract: "Firms seek suitable and diverse candidates at low hiring costs. Stressing selectivity can presumably act as a screening device and lower hiring costs. Ideally, it induces only the most suitable candidates to apply. However, as candidates also differ in risk aversion, competitiveness etc., the effect on the pool of applicants is not clear. We investigate how stressing selectivity affects the pool of applicants â€“ with a special focus on diversity. For that purpose, we collaborate with a bank in Switzerland and intervene during information events for students interested in starting an apprenticeship at that bank."
