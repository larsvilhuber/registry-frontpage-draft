abstract: "Low and irregular labor force participation, high labor turnover and absenteeism are major impediments to productivity in poor countries. We hypothesize that workers have difficulty providing regular labor supply in the formal sector because they might not a preference for doing so. We design an RCT with urban casual laborers in India, where laborers are provided incentives to boost their labor supply to urban labor stands -- their primary source of regular employment. We examine the persistence of effects on labor supply once incentives are removed."
