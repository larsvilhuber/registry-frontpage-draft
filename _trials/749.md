abstract: "Shallow markets in African food grains impose substantial welfare costs; they are a direct contributor to food insecurity and may dampen the incentives to invest in productivity-enhancing inputs to agriculture.  We will implement a suite of interventions in a large Randomized Controlled Trial involving 240 markets in Uganda, intended to improve market depth directly.  We are training and certifying 210 Commission Agents who will operate in treatment markets using a number of technology-based tools to facilitate trade in maize, beans, bananas, and tomatoes.  Agents and buyers can use mobile-phone based SMS to post bids and asks into a new digital trading platform that matches supply with demand and facilitates long-distance trade.  We are gathering price data in all study markets and using a number of SMS-based approaches to push out marketing and price information to farmers, traders, and buyers in treatment areas.  To investigate the role that contract risk plays in inhibiting trade we will implement a sub-experiment in which buyers are randomly offered a basic or comprehensive guarantee that will reimburse part of their transport costs if a deal falls through.  To investigate the role of credit constraints in the supply chain we will randomize access to Cash on Bag credit for a subset of agents.  The study aims to shed light on the relative contributions of the major causes of shallow markets that have emerged from the theoretical literature."
