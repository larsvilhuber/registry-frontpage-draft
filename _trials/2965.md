abstract: "In a laboratory experiment with common value auctions, we study the impact of endogenously revealed information. The outcomes of interest are the revenue properties of different auction formats and the response of participants to information, e.g. by adjusting bidding strategies. In three treatments, we compare a second-price auction with an English auction with irrevocable exit (Japanese English auction) and an oral outcry auction."
