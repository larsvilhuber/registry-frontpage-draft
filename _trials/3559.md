abstract: "We test the effectiveness of a home-visit intervention to reduce the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia among children between 6 a 36 months of age in Sechura, a poor district located in northern Peru. Our sample consists of 47 peri-urban villages, which were randomly split into treatment and control in equal proportions. The World Food Programme conducted a home-visiting program in the treatment villages, which provided caregivers with information about locally available iron-rich foods and how to cook them to maximize their children's iron intake. During home visits, caregivers were also offered information about the importance of preventing anemia in young children, hygiene practices, feeding practices during illness periods, and responsive feeding. Our main outcome variables are the prevalence of anemia in children under 36 months of age, caregivers' knowledge about which local foods are rich in iron, their consumption patterns and cooking practices.
