abstract: "TV plays an important role in introducing ideas in societies where literacy is relatively low and social norms discourage novel ideas, especially related to stigmatized behaviors. Educational entertainment (“edutainment”) is a communication strategy that works through mass entertainment media with the aim of promoting a better context for behavior change than the delivery of information alone.  

This evaluation uses an experimental design to study the impact of MTV series Shuga, a TV drama targeted at youth that aims to change social norms and behavior related to high-risk sexual behavior and gender-based violence. The impact evaluation will be among the first to experimentally estimate the impact of a product similar to commercial TV series (as opposed to an educational movie). It will be the first time that two crucial aspects of edutainment programs are evaluated: i) their “spillover” effect on people who did not watch the drama but may have heard about it from friends and ii) their effect through viewers’ perceptions of the beliefs and values of their peers after watching the drama.  For instance, young men may only be willing to treat their partners with respect when they think that this will not make them look weak in the eyes of other men.  

The evaluation will employ a clustered randomized trial design where communities will be randomly assigned to treatment 1 (Shuga screenings only), treatment 2 (Shuga screenings plus information about attitudes of peers) and control groups. The Friends treatment is cross-cutting across the treatment arms and will be randomized at the individual level.
