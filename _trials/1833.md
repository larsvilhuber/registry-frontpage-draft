abstract: "The purpose of this pilot study is to 1) describe parental attitudes towards child vaccination and intentions to pursue an exemption by behavioral phenotype; 2) compare the effect of four different exemption requirements on parent attitudes and intentions; 3) explore differential response to exemption regimes by behavioral phenotype. Behavioral phenotypes will be assessed using previously-validated scales. As a pilot study, we also aim to establish the feasibility of assessing behavioral phenotypes and simulating different exemption regimes in an online sample of parents with preschool children"
