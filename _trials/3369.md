abstract: "Lack of skills is arguably one of the most important determinants for high levels of unemployment and poverty. Targeting youth unemployment and also important because of its strong influence on other important social outcomes. Using a experimental design based on an admission cutoff, we examine the employment effects of a vocational training program in Nepal launched in 2009 over a three-year period."
