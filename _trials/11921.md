abstract: "This study focuses on studying an individual's preferences on minimum wage policies. It will reveal what people think about and what influences their vote when they are to vote for or against a minimum wage bill. I hope to shed some light on the link between an individual's location on the wage distribution and their attitudes towards minimum wages. "
