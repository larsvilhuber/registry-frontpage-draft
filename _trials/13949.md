abstract: "We propose an online experiment to study the role of feedback on dishonesty in a competitive setting. The effects of competition and feedback on dishonest reporting behaviour have been widely studied in the literature. While some research suggests that competition can increase unethical conduct, others have found that competitive environments can also promote integrity and fairness. Similarly, the impact of performance feedback on dishonest behaviour is mixed, with studies showing either an increase or a decrease in cheating. The experiment aims to shed light on the interplay between competition and feedback, and their joint influence on individuals' propensity to misreport outcomes. In the experiment, subjects have an incentive to misreport a random outcome in their favour. We study how mis-reporting such an outcome is affected by the payment scheme (individual piece-rate vs winner takes all contest) and by the information about others' choices (no information vs past reports). Moreover, we study whether the effect of competition will carry over and affect individuals' misreporting in a subsequent round with a piece-rate payment scheme."
