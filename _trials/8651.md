abstract: "This experiment collects and analysis the data for the lottery players that the spectators in the Study "Finding Merit Where there is None - Cross Country Differences" (AEARCTR-0008552). Participants take part in a lottery where they win if their "winning color" matches the color that is drawn in the lottery. They first play the lottery with a randomly allocated "winning color" and then play it with a chosen "winning color". Before the lottery, participants answer questions that make it possible to classify whether or not they have meritocratic elements in their fairness preferences. We are interested in whether meritocrats differ from non-meritocrats in whether or not they chance their winning color from the one randomly chosen for them. "
