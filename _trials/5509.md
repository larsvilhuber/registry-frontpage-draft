abstract: "The project seeks to study the effect of using gender-neutral language in job advertisements on the quantity, quality (level of education and skill), and gender breakdown of the applicant pool in a widely used platform for the hiring of talent in the Tech Sector in Latin America (where Spanish is the main language). We implement a randomized controlled trial in which Job ads are randomly selected, at pre-approval, to be compliant with gender-neutral language."
