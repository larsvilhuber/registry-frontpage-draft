abstract: "Background: Many girls in developing countries get their first menstrual period without knowing what it is, leaving them scared and ill-informed about practicing Menstrual Health (MH). Girls’ poor ability to manage MH plays a role in the barriers to education, and general wellbeing. This paper presents the protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial on the impact of a complex intervention facilitating MH in Bangladesh: the Ritu trial. 

Methods/Design: We randomized 149 schools from one rural district, into three groups; i) receiving a school program (sanitation facilities, teacher trainings and MH module for school curriculum); ii) a school program and a household program (parental education and MH visual booklet); iii) a control group. The primary beneficiaries are schoolgirls in grades 6 until 8, age 11-15. The program will last for 3 years, and the primary outcomes are education outcomes, psychosocial outcomes and empowerment of adolescent girls. We will make use of administrative data, experimental data and survey data. School data of all pupils is collected throughout; additionally, a subsample of 4,172 girls partakes in surveys; Survey data collection took place at baseline (2017), and planned at midline (2019) and endline (2021). We will analyse both the short-term and long-term effects of both treatment arms in addition to cost-effectiveness evaluations and a process evaluation. 

Discussion:  Even though MH programs are becoming more popular, there is very limited evidence on the measurement of key outcomes and the impact of such programs. We aim to reduce these knowledge gaps and to provide policy lessons for future implementers or policymakers.
