abstract: "As stated in various reports, any strong resistance or backlashed to sexuality education and condom and contraception availability programmes for adolescents in schools and communities from parents and community groups, is a real challenge that can prevent the development of policies and making of laws that will protect, maintain, and improve adolescents sexual and reproductive health. A community-based, cluster-randomized controlled trial (CRT) will be carried out to evaluate the effects of a health education intervention on adults’ knowledge, attitudes and support for comprehensive sexuality education, condom and contraceptives availability for adolescents in Cross River State, Nigeria. The study will consist of three phases:Phase 1: Pre-intervention (baseline) assessment Phase 2: health education intervention Phase 3: post-intervention assessment. The target population for this study will be all adult male and female parents or guardians, resident in Cross River State, Nigeria. The sample size for this study will be determined using the two Proportion estimation formula to be 346 ×2 = 692 for the two groups. Participants for the study will be recruited from 24 geographic clusters of approximately equal size mapped for the purpose of randomization. The clusters will be created based on geographic boundaries and population density. The twenty-four (24) selected clusters will then be randomized to intervention or control conditions of three (3) arms - intervention: mixed teaching methods (8), single teaching method (8); and control (8), through the generation of random allocation sequence using random number generated programme. The instrument that will be used to collect data for this study will be a semi-structured validated Questionnaire. Data that will be collected will be double entered in standard spreadsheets separately for the purpose of quality. Descriptive and inferential statistics of the entered data will be analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software, version 26.0.
