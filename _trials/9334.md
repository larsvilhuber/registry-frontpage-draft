abstract: "The goal of this research is to use insights from behavioral economics to mitigate the free-riding problem in public goods games. We will examine the role of real-time feedback versus intermediate goals (milestones) in shaping dynamic contributions to a public good. Individuals can contribute to the same public good from a fixed endowment over multiple time periods, and they receive different types of feedback at the end of each period depending on treatment assignment. This research will contribute to the well-established literature on voluntary contribution mechanism."
