abstract: "We study whether mentioning that a study is about COVID-19 vaccination leads to sample selection. We will randomly allocate participants to a condition where the consent form mentions that the study is about COVID-19 vaccination or to a condition without this information. After the consent form, we ask participants about COVID-19 vaccination behaviors. We will hence be able to understand whether telling participants that the research study is about COVID-19 vaccination impacts vaccination attitudes."
