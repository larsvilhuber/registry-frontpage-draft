abstract: "In the Netherlands, a number of municipalities got permission from the national government to experiment with the welfare system. The city of Nijmegen is one of these municipalities. In the regular welfare regime, the last safety net of the welfare state is social assistance: a means tested benefit for people who lack other income (for example for people who lose their job and whose unemployment benefits have ended, or refugees who are granted an official status). People who receive social assistance in the Netherlands are bound to strict obligations regarding reintegration in the labor market, and sanctions if they fail to live up to them. Under the experimental regime, social assistance recipients can be allowed to keep an amount of money, if they earn any in addition to their allowance. Further, the strict rules on reintegration can be loosened. The municipality created two combination treatments based on this, that differ substantially from the regular regime. The core difference is that the experimental treatments are based on giving recipients more autonomy and trust. This is expected to have a positive effect on labor market outcomes (work, part-time work, entrepreneurship), participation, health and well being. "
