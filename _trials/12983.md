abstract: "Real-effort tasks in experimental economics provide valuable insights into labor market outcomes by mimicking real-world work dynamics. Gender experiments often use these tasks to explore biases and differences in task performance, confidence, and competition entry. However, previous research indicates that gender performance variations may be influenced by task perceptions, especially those seen as favoring a particular gender. This study examines the influence of gender stereotypes on task performance perceptions, beliefs, and misperceptions. Using five commonly real-effort tasks, we analyze how individuals assess their own performance, interpret task gender associations, and adhere to social norms regarding gender-based task performance. Our analysis plan includes outcome variables such as task performance, beliefs about performance, task perceptions, social norms, and misperceptions. We hypothesize gender differences in performance, beliefs, perceptions, and confidence, influenced by task gender congruence and societal expectations."
