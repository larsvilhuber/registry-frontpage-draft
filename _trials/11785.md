abstract: "Career guidance is essential for an informed study choice. Information on labour demand (e.g., wages) is particularly relevant in order to help youngsters make study choice that fit current and future demand. However, experiments that make such labour market information available to youngsters do not always have the expected effect, suggesting that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Responsiveness to such information is likely to depend on personal characteristics (e.g., gender and migration background), time and risk preferences and skill level (e.g., numeracy, literacy, graph literacy or economic literacy), as well as on the way the information is presented. In collaboration with one of the largest career guidance platforms in the Netherlands, we conduct a field experiment for 15-year-old students to investigate what format of presenting wage information has the strongest effect on study choice. Our experiment aims at expanding the literature in two ways. First, we analyse what format of labour market information has the strongest effect on study choice. We distinguish between a pictograph (bar chart vs. icon arrays), a (neutral or colourful) ladder or a table in providing wage information for occupations. We hypothesize that the effects depend on gender, socio-economic status, time and risk preferences and migration background. Second, we analyse to what extent the potential heterogeneous effects are driven by differences in numeracy, literacy, graph literacy and economic literacy skills. This enables us to distinguish whether different individuals make intrinsically different choices, or whether different choices are a result of different skill levels. We hypothesize that at least part of the effect of making different choices is the result of different skill levels. We would like to investigate whether differences in skills can fully explain the expected differences in responsiveness towards labour market information. This insight would not only contribute to scientific literature, but would be also highly valuable for policy makers as it provides directions on how to reduce inequality of opportunities by improving the way career guidance is provided."
