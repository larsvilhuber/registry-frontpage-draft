abstract: "India is investing heavily in initiating skill development programs to mitigate the growing skills gap and prepare its youth with skills needed for the employment industry. However, the experience in the low-skilled sector so far has been riddled with low take up of training programs and high attrition in subsequent job placements. More generally, little is known about how job seekers in low skilled occupations weigh trade offs across job characteristics, which could be crucial in understanding their job search, tenure and job switches. This pilot study proposes to use placements after a vocational training program to do three things: (i) elicit unbiased preferences of trainees over various job characteristics and examine the consistency of these stated preferences with actual job choices; (ii) examine the knowledge and utilization of information on traineeâ€™s preferences by trainers (placement officers) during job placement to improve the quality of placements; (iii) examine the employment choices and labor market activities of trainees after the completion of the training program through follow up surveys."
