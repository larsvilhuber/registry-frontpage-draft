abstract: "This study will conduct a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with 10 million users on a large video-sharing social media platform in China to answer two sets of questions. First, we document the extent of self-control issues (e.g., overuse of the platform, naivete over time usage and uninstallment, what types of content more "addicted" or "naive" people tend to view or be engaged with) on the platform, providing insight to the state of digital addiction for hundreds of millions of people on one of the worlds largest platforms. Second, we investigate if an intervention opting users into a soft commitment device (alarms that pop up after an exogenously varied time limit) impacts time usage patterns on the platform and propensity to uninstall. Based on the heterogeneous treatment effects we also document whether the firm's incentives over who to target for treatment assignment (to reduce uninstallment) coincides with a social planner's optimal targeted treatment assignment (to reduce self-control issues). Our participants will be randomised into 7 groups: a control group, and 6 treatment groups following a factorial design that (i) varies the time at which alarms pop up on their screen (20/60/120 minutes into the user's day) and (ii) whether or not users are shown a "bedtime alarm" or "usage reminder" pop-up screen that tells them to set an alarm that pops up after X mins of use or set a bedtime reminder that pops up at a certain time of night.
