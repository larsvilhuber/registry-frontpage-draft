abstract: "This paper presents one of the first evaluations of a principal-training program in a developing country. We randomly assigned 100 public primary schools in the Province of Salta, Argentina to a treatment group in which school principals attended a six-week, intensive, training workshop provided by an international foundation, or to a business-as-usual control group."
