abstract: "Adolescents in low-resource settings develop low aspirations when faced with life pressures leading to an aspirations trap. We expose eighth-graders in Kenya to a psychosocial intervention (Youth First-Kenya) that aims to bridge the gap between the perception of oneâ€™s abilities and what is achievable. We examine the impact on aspirations, enrolment, and achievement of students."
