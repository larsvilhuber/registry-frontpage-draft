abstract: "Economic transactions may lead to disputes where the weaker party claims economic abuse or injury. A key consideration for whether policy or legislation should intervene is a lack of consent from the weaker party. An important element of consent is the information state of the weaker party at the time of transacting. With decreasing costs of information disclosure, this has led to governments, firms, and legislators inundating consumers with pre-transactional information (or mandating for it to be so). For example, mandatory disclosure "is among the most ubiquitous and least controversial elements of public policy, often promoted as an attractive alternative to so-called hard forms of regulation" (Loewenstein et al, 2014). The appeal of information disclosure stems from the general presumption that while more information may not necessarily help, it cannot make things worse for consumers. Motivated by literatures on blame, counterfactual thinking, and the psychology of consent, we explore avenues through which information disclosure may make things worse for the consumer. We consider how information disclosure affects both society (through third-party spectators) and the stronger partyâ€™s interpretations of the extent the consumer is believed to have consented to the outcomes, an issue that has received little scrutiny in the economics literature.
