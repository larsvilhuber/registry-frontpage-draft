abstract: "Using a sample of about 3,000 households in rural Bangladesh, we assess the effectiveness of the Lions Quest Skills for Growing program in a new data collection about three years after its implementation in grades 2 to 5 in 2019. Lions Quest Skills for Growing is a school based social and emotional learning program that was taught in randomly assigned elementary schools in Bangladesh. Two of its main goals address health-related behavior, and more generally, the program aims at responsible decision-making. 
Here, we examine whether the program affects higher-order risk preferences and whether these are associated with improvements in preventive and particularly health-related behaviors among adolescents, where effect sizes in the case of preferences will be compared to those due to intergenerational transmission in a sub-sample. Risk preferences are measured experimentally, and preventative and health-related behaviors are surveyed using an extensive catalogue of corresponding questions. This new data collection will start as soon as this registration will be reviewed. "
