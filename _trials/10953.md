abstract: "The norms that underpin societal prejudice can be highly persistent, but using the law to grant rights to minority groups may generate changes in whether people think discrimination is socially acceptable. In this project, I will test whether the expansion of legal rights for a stigmatized minority - transgender persons in India - has an effect on discrimination in a real-stakes hiring choice. I will measure whether telling people about the expanding legal status of transgenders can improve their attitudes directly, and will also examine whether such an intervention can generate positive social spillovers: do people talk more positively about transgenders in a group discussion after hearing about transgender rights, and can this persuade others in their group to subsequently discriminate less?
