abstract: "We propose a two stage randomized controlled trial that seeks to evaluate the effect of incentives to dairy cooperatives, on their quality of milk and governance. We will evaluate the extent to which dairy cooperatives respond to clean milk incentives and randomly varied exposure to community based monitoring.We expect the treatments to have direct effects on the governance and performance of dairy cooperatives.  Data will come from scientifically validated milk testing procedures, participant surveys, and financial audits."
