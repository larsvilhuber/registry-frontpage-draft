abstract: "Barriers to commercial farming are probably the most significant frictions to agricultural development in Africa. Moreover, improving agricultural productivity is the most effective way to improving living standards of the poor given their significant dependence on (subsistence) agriculture and the larger productivity gaps between agriculture and other sectors. 

The Government of Uganda is committed to vegetable oil development in order to promote a competitive, profitable and sustainable agricultural sector as the basis for job creation, export development and provision of improved livelihoods for the rural population. For this purpose, IFAD supported two phases of the Vegetable Oil Development Project (VODP), joint with local public-private partnership. The first round of Vegetable Oil Development Project (VODP1) was conceived in the mid-1990s and was approved in April 1997 with the aim to reduce Uganda’s heavy reliance on imports of vegetable oil, despite good potential for domestic production, and to address the low intake of vegetable oils by the population. VODP1 supports vegetable oil production as well as agro-processing and marketing and is an important thrust in Government’s efforts to modernize and commercialize agriculture. The project is highly innovative inasmuch as it introduced a new crop (oil palm) to Uganda and a new form of public-private partnership (PPP). VODP1 has addressed rural poverty by involving smallholder farmers in crop production and small-scale processing, in improving the nutrition of the population through increased consumption of vegetable oil, and improving food security through the growing of alternative cash crops for income generation. Several lessons have been learned from phase 1 and have guided the design of phase 2. Among several factors, it is worth mentioning the important benefits from private-public partnerships (PPP), the crucial role of gradual, bottom-up and flexible capacity-building process in order to affect small-farmers behaviour and actions. The second phase of VODP (VODP2) builds on VODP1 and maintain the two components related to oilseeds and oil palm. The current report focuses only of the former. The oilseeds component of VODP2 has been targeted to reach 136,000 smallholder households in four Uganda macro-regions or agro-industrial hubs, namely West Nile Hub, Gulu Hub, Lira Hub, Eastern Uganda Hub . The project is supplied by private providers in different areas and includes both technical services for increased oilseed production and market information (i.e. training about farming as a business, business-oriented group development, marketing). The ultimate goal of the intervention was to contribute to sustainable poverty reduction in rural Uganda regions. The project is innovative inasmuch as it introduced a new form of value-chain approach and boosted the transformation of substance farming to commercial agricultural within a competitive market. 

In our research study we carry out an impact assessment of the VODP2 extension model on oilseed adoption, farm output, productivity and well-being. We do so by designing a randomized control trail and exploiting the phase-in slant of VODP2 and roll-out over time of activities in different areas. By using a random assignment estimation strategy (intention to treatment effect) we find that VODP2 has a positive and significant effects on immediate outcomes, such as farmers’ price and yield expectations, vegetable oil seeds adoption and input use. We find more mixed results on intermediate outcomes in terms of productivity and revenue. We do find, though, positive effects on market access (group sale) and value-chain involvement. We find very little effect on final wellbeing outcomes. These effects are consistent in delivering a clean picture of VODP2 effectiveness in fostering commercial farming, productivity and market engagement. The lesson learned is not distrustful, but it provides a sound basis for further need of medium-term efforts in order to develop a sustainable and profitable vegetable oil subsector, which is able to eventually increase household income and well-being.
