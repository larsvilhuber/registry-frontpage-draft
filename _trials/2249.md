abstract: "This study examines whether antenatal care (ANC) practiced in rural Nigeria improves maternal and child health behaviors and outcomes. We randomize a cash incentive for one ANC visit and information about ANC at the village level. We examine the impacts of these one-shot interventions in the sequence of prenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal periods, over two years after birth. The study covers 1032 pregnant women in 100 villages. "
