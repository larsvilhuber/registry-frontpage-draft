abstract: "This study investigates the impact of a disaster information campaign designed to raise flood risk perceptions and promote mitigation behavior among vulnerable urban households in Mozambique. The information campaign provided community leaders and households with contextualized, actionable information related to flood risk through videos shown during home visits and text messages. The project evaluates the effect of the interventions on perceptions and behavior, as well as how these changes in behavior reduce flooding and the impact of flooding."
