abstract: "The team wants to test the impact of an Investment Readiness Program (IRP) that is geared to facilitate access to equity finance for innovative start-ups and SMEs. Lack of access to equity finance for innovative start-ups and SMEs has been recognized as a major problem in the region, and there is a belief that many firms have good ideas but lack the necessary know-how and preparedness to be ready to pitch their ideas to external investors. The investment readiness program is aimed at getting firms ready for a pitch event, through a combination of training, mentoring, master classes, pitch practice, and other assistance. "
