abstract: "Since an impairment of endometrial receptivity may be a potential cause of subfertility in women diagnosed with unexplained infertility (UI), therefore, it is supposed that local endometrial injury may help a group of women with UI. Based on this concept, the aim of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of local endometrial injury (site-specific hysteroscopic-guided) in a group of women with UI undergoing expectant management versus no intervention."
