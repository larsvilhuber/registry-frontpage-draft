abstract: "Do implicit gender bias affect managers' discriminating behaviors? Does becoming aware of own implicit bias attenuate discrimination?

The project consist of a two-step lab-in-the-field experiment. As a general summary: we will evaluate gender bias of managers through the IAT test, reveal to the respondents of the treatment group their own score in the IAT, deliver a second survey in which we will be asking managers from treatment and control group to evaluate explicitly hypothetical students profiles according to the methods of the Incentivized Resume Rating.

The experiment is done on two different population:
1) the population of Italian managers making part of the largest managers' association in Italy
2) the population of all employees from a High Tech firm in Italy: in this second case, we will be able to identify employees, middle managers and managers. To the bulk of employees, we will provide two different treatments: the one aforementioned and another treatment containing general information about the gender gap in Italy. We will be able to identify the effect of both disclosing own implicit stereotypes or to provide information about the general status of the labor market in terms of gender gap. 


We decided to evaluate the effects of our treatment in the long-run as well. At the end of January 2023, after about 8 months from our treatment, we will replicate the Incentivized Resume Rating (the evaluation of Curricula), to study whether the treatment still has an effect on the score given to candidates."
