In Denmark, this knowledge gap already exits at school start and it remains throughout the school years. The purpose of this randomized control trial is to asses, whether an in-home intervention aimed at disadvantaged children can have positive effects on these children's reading skills and well-being.

In the inervention, Paried reading, the child read with an adult three times a week during the course of 15 weeks. Paired Reading has already been tested in a British and Swedish context, where it has shown promising results.
