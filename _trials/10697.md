abstract: "How does the gender of subordinates affect managers’ management styles? The current management literature tends to focus on investigating the differences in management styles and effectiveness across the gender of managers (Paoloni and Demartini, 2016). A qualitative study by Atwater et al. (2001) touches on this question by comparing different combinations of the gender of managers and subordinates in terms of disciplinary actions but fails to provide a conclusive insight due to the small sample size. This paper asks whether top managers change their management style by introducing female workers and perceive the change to be costly. We attempt to provide causal evidence on the effects of subordinates’ gender on management styles. To answer this question, we ask the sample of about 600 top managers in the garment manufacturing industry in Pakistan; what disciplinary actions they will take in several hypothetical situations. The key part of this design is that we randomize the gender of a subordinate to whom a top manager has to give a disciplinary measure and that all top managers are asked to think of themselves as top managers of a hypothetical company."
