abstract: "We analyze preferences and perceptions on the financial contributions of individual EU member states to the budget of the Union, using a representative panel of German households. We ask subjects to estimate the annual gross contribution to the EU budget as a percentage of annual gross national income of the six most populous EU countries. In a next step, the subjects are randomly assigned to treatment groups which receive different information concerning the gross and net contribution of EU countries to the EU budget. Based on the information available to the respondents, they are asked whether they would raise or lower the annual contribution of Germany to the EU budget. In the final question, we confront the subjects in the panel with the question whether other EU countries generally contribute too little to the EU budget.
