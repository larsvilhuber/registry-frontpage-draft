abstract: "The project ‘Increased School Nurse Resource in Systemic and Structured Collaboration with Norwegian Primary Schools’ is part of a larger research programme financed by the Norwegian Directorate of Education. The main aim of the programme is to investigate how different professionals, working in collaboration with the school staff, may contribute to students’ learning environment and learning outcomes. The present study is a randomised, controlled trial whose principal aim is to investigate how an increased school nurse resource at randomly selected schools in 14 Norwegian municipalities affect the students’ psychosocial environment, and secondarily, their broader learning environment and academic outcomes.

The project is a cluster-randomised controlled trial where four schools in each of 14 municipalities are randomly selected to receive a 12.5% position increased school nurse resource from January 2018 to December 2019. The school nurse should work in a structured and systemic collaboration with the school and the resource should target 5th – 7th grade (age 10-12). In the project, systemic collaboration means that school nurses are involved in the school’s overall work with keeping overview of the health and well-being of the students, including initiating and implementing universal and preventive measures targeting psychosocial aspects of the learning environment. Structured collaboration means that schools and school nurses organise their collaboration by regular meeting/contacts in contrast to collaboration based on irregular and arbitrary contact between schools and the school health services only.  Systemic work is described in  the revised and recently passed guidelines for the school health service (The Norwegian Directorate for Health, 2017) and the project provides guidelines for the meeting series between the school nurse and staff at schools.
