abstract: "The current Covid-19 pandemic is having global impact on our way of life. For example, peopleâ€™s activity and eating behaviour changed in order to fit in with the guidance on social distancing and staying at home. There is some emerging literature that weight gain during lock down is minimal. However, it is not known whether eating behaviour and resulting weight changes are different in people with obesity as compared to general population. Our study will provide information on eating behaviour and fruit and vegetable consumption during lockdown. This will help to inform obesity prevention policy interventions and ultimately health outcomes."
