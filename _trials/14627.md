abstract: "We are studying Inspiring Teacher's Tools for Foundational Learning Improvement (TFLI). TFLI uses best practices from early-grade reading
instruction in a structured pedagogy format, in which teachers are given teacher guides with semi-scripted, high-quality lesson plans that tell them exactly how to teach their classes. These plans are linked to workbooks and also to training and support from Inspiring Teachers employees, who are expert teachers and teacher trainers. This basic approach has been proven to be highly effective in many other interventions and contexts across Africa. TFLI adds a digital layer to this structured pedagogy approach, with teachers accessing program material and training videos via the Smart Coach smartphone app. The app will also collect high-frequency data on student outcomes, which Inspiring Teachers can use to modify the intervention on the fly, capturing the best aspects of teaching at the right level (TaRL) interventions as well.

In this study we aim to use the Inspiring Teachers TFLI approach to explore how support for assessment-informed targeted instruction can be built into structured pedagogy and how technology can be used to support that process to enable cost-effective and data driven teacher and school support. Using grade 1 and 2 students in primary schools in Cape Coast, Ghana, as our study context, we seek to determine four things:1) how TFLI affects learning outcomes, 2) the optimal way to deliver TFLI (i.e., how best to deploy the digital layer to improve learning outcomes), 3) how the benefits of structured pedagogy and teaching at the right level (TaRL) substitute for or complement each other, and 4) how best to integrate the two approaches."
