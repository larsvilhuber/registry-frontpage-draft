abstract: "Using a large scale field experiment, we compare the effects of three different tax enforcement policies to increase compliance with VAT reporting for newly established firms. In this pre-analysis plan we describe the treatments and lay out some important decisions with respect to coding of variables, definitions of samples and the empirical strategy we will apply."
