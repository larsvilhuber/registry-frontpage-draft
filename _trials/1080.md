abstract: "There has been a lot of research studying whether students can benefit from being exposed to cognitively more able peers. On the other hand, there has been much less research studying whether students can be hampered by disruptive peers. In this study we measure the effects of "Habilidades para la vida", a program aiming to improve the classroom behaviour of the most disruptive students in 2nd grade in Chile. We will study the effects of this program on disruptive students, on their teachers, and on their non-disruptive classmates."
