abstract: "The study design is a randomized control trial that compares the reading proficiency of kindergarten students who receive the accelerated 1:1 high dosage tutoring support to kindergarten students who receive the regular 1:1 high dosage tutoring support. The study will involve 800 kindergarten students enrolled in 40 kindergarten classrooms identified by the district who agree to participate in Chapter One’s 1:1 high dosage tutoring, randomly assigning 400 to one treatment group (T1, accelerated tutoring) and 400 to the other treated group (T2, regular tutoring). All students in the study will receive the tutoring support (i.e., accelerated tutoring or regular tutoring) throughout their kindergarten school year assuming they remain enrolled in the school district."
