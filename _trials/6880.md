abstract: "In recent decades, many financial education programs have been implemented in schools across many countries. These programs are an effort to increase the persistently low financial literacy levels among the population, and better prepare them for making adult financial decisions. While there is a large literature about the short-run impacts of financial education, (Kaiser, Lusardi, Menkhoff, and Urban 2020) there is less evidence of its impacts in the longer run. That is, when individuals start making more and more financial decisions on a day to day basis, and they make one of the most important financial decisions in their lives: which level of human capital to acquire. We fill this gap by extending Bover, Hospido and Villanueva (2020) causal analysis of a financial education training course implemented in secondary education. The authors find positive short-term effects on financial literacy and an increase in patience in both hypothetical saving choices and in an incentivized saving task.  We complement this study by following participants after five years of this program. This allows us to test whether financial education impacts persist over time in financial literacy, but also whether it impacts other outcomes such as financial attitudes, patience, intertemporal decision making, financial inclusion, and earnings and employment expectations. Furthermore, we can study the financial education impact in education choices and provide insights on how those decisions vary with responses to the mentioned outcomes."
