abstract: "This project investigates the demand for commitment and the role of peer pressure in shaping the uptake of commitment contracts for safe driving. I propose that such contracts can serve as a justification for evading the social norm of speeding, thereby mitigating the status signaling aspect of driving fast. To test this mechanism, I design a demand experiment using GPS technology to offer contracts providing monetary rewards for safe driving. By manipulating the conditions under which the contracts are offered, I aim to quantify the demand for incentives to drive safely and to test whether the possibility to use the contract as a justification to drive slow influences the uptake of these contracts.
