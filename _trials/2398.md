abstract: "Energy costs in a campus dormitory setting are often not well understood or salient for students. They do not see billing or consumption information, making it difficult to translate use of particular energy services into costs. As a result, energy consumption is often “out of sight, out of mind” as students go through their busy days. Our research aims to enhance our understanding of how best to address these issues of saliency and understanding. Our project has two primary focuses. The first is to quantify the effects of information interventions on energy consumption. The second is to see whether those effects dissipate if the information is provided for a group of several rooms rather than for a single room. In other words, how does the level of aggregation for the information provided impact its effectiveness for reducing energy consumption? While we expect information to have the strongest effect at the room-level, individually metering rooms is costly. Therefore, understanding the impact of aggregation can help campus planners interested in using information to reduce consumption with their decisions about how to sub-meter dorms. We will conduct randomized control trials in a university residence hall, in order to test for the effect of social norms and meter aggregation on energy consumption. Our interventions will include three types of information: (1) weekly-level consumption, (2) tips for behavioral changes that could help reduce energy consumption, and (3) how the level of consumption compares to those of the average and to the most efficient neighbors. Social comparisons have been widely used by water and electric utilities because they have been shown to be remarkably cost effective, reducing consumption by 2-4\% for the relatively low cost of adding an additional section to the bill (e.g. Allcott 2011, Jessoe et al. 2017). In the context of university residence halls, previous studies have shown that these types of interventions can also be effective (e. g. Delmas and Lessem 2014). The effect of aggregation, however, has not yet been investigated. Furthermore, our study will be the first to focus on heating/cooling systems, which can account for over 40\% of energy consumption in the residential context (EIA, 2013)."
