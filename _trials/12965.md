abstract: "We investigate how information provision affects people’s views on the appropriate trade-offs between lives and livelihoods in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants are recruited online and randomly assigned to multiple groups. We provide participants with different types of information and then ask questions about the appropriate trade-offs between lives and livelihoods. To shed light on the mechanism, we will also examine how information provision affect people’s perception of the tradeoff as well as their perceptions of the opinions of others."
