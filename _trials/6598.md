abstract: "The study is a two phased project that is testing the impact of account labeling on the savings behavior of rural customers serviced by Susu agents (savings collectors).  The original labeled account study, referred to as Phase I, is an RCT comparing treatment customers who were offered a labeled Susu account to control customers who were not offered an account. The follow up study, referred to as Phase II, is an RCT that again provided a labeled Susu account to treatment customers but, this time offered an unlabeled Susu account to control customers."
