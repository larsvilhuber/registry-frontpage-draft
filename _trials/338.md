abstract: "This project involves two RCTs to measure the impact of alternative pricing models and information interventions on access to improved sanitation services in peri-urban West Africa.

The market for improved sanitation services (mechanized desludging in particular) is important:  sanitation services have high externalities for the local communities. A government may want to intervene in the market for sanitation services but find it difficult to do so as they are unable to observe values for the consumers or costs for the service providers.  We will measure the underlying values of services for customers, measure the cost of providing services for desludging operators, and measure the impact of information on the level of satisfaction of households with their desludging operators and whether they continue to use them on future desludgings.  This information can then be used to help in designing interventions by the government which will improve the market structure of sanitation services.

In Accra, Ghana, a more advanced sanitation service market, we introduce a call center system aimed at improving linkages between desludging providers and customers, and test the impact on desludging prices, customer satisfaction, and desludger business revenue.

In a related study in Burkina Faso, a less developed market where manual desludging is still prevalent, we test the effect of alternative pricing models on: the average price of mechanical desludging, takeup of mechanical desludging, and willingness to pay for sanitation services."
