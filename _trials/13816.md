abstract: "In this survey experiment, we survey roughly 5000 academic economists to measure factors that influence their assessment of research quality. We are particularly interested in factors that can be chosen by the researcher. In particular, we will explore the effect of 1) spelling errors, 2) grammar errors, 3) the choice of writing program (e.g., LaTeX vs. Microsoft Word), and 4) interaction effects of demographics on the treatments. To do this, subjects will be assigned to one of 6 treatments (cover pages) that vary according to whether they are written in Microsoft Word or LaTeX, whether they have spelling errors, and whether they have grammar errors. After exposure to one of the six treatments, subject perception of research quality will be assessed using a series of Likert scales."
