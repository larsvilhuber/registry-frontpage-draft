abstract: "Through an online experiment on Amazon's Mechanical Turk, we examine how people assess images generated by artificial intelligence (AI) in order to gain more insights into how people perceive AI. By using three different information sets at the beginning of the survey, subjects are confronted with images generated by AI and rate them according to liking, emotion, creativity, and hypothetical willingness to pay. Finally, the evaluations of the AI-generated images of the treatment groups will be compared with a control group that receives no information."
