abstract: "We conduct a survey with several sub-surveys to study sickness presenteeism, the phenomenon that individuals work (also from home) while they are sick. We design factorial surveys, which we combine with information experiments and specific subgroup analyses to study the overall phenomenology of presenteeism, the connection between career ambitions and presenteeism, how the team situation affects presenteeism behavior and to what extent women with menstrual complaints show different presenteeism behavior, for instance due to social pressure.
