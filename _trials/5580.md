abstract: "Expectations about the benefits of a social program, and the degree of engagement in its implementation can drastically change the perceived gains from it. Higher than realized expectations can lead to disappointment and even refusal of the program, while the possibility of choosing aspects of its implementation can increase satisfaction. We use a 2x2 randomized design that explores the expansion of a home upgrading program in the Dominican Republic to study the degree to which unmet expectations and choice over the implementation affect satisfaction and well-being  of beneficiaries."
