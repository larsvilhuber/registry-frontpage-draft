abstract: "The aim of the project is to measure interregional trust, its determinants and associated expectations in Russia for the first time. We will apply an incentivized online experiment where the participants interact in real time across regions. They will make decisions simultaneously in the trust game (Berg et al., 1995). In this game, participants are paired. The first member of the pair (the trustor) decides whether or not to transfer a certain amount of money to the second member (the trustee). Before handed over to the trustee, the transferred amount is tripled. The matched trustee has then the opportunity to return any of the received amount to the trustor. Trust by the trustor and trustworthiness of the trustee, allow both members of a pair to get high earnings, while the lack of trust and trustworthiness (equilibrium behavior) deprives them of such an opportunity. The study will involve university students from (tentatively) twelve distinct Russian regions. The participants will be matched either with participants from their own city/region or with participants from one of the other eleven cities/regions. Immediately after the main experiment, all participants will be asked to state their expectations regarding the matched trustor’s or trustee’s behavior. Finally, survey questions will be asked related to participants’ socio-demographic characteristics, trust attitudes, knowledge about the other cities/regions involved in the study, personality, and economic preferences.
