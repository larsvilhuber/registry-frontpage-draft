abstract: "We test the impact of providing migrant workers with an improved ability to direct remittances to particular uses through labeling. Migrant remittances are one of the largest financial flows to developing countries. However, we are still learning how remittances can be best utilized by recipient households and what policies might increase the development impact of remittances. 
A key barrier to maximizing the development potential of remittances is that migrants who are sending these funds have limited ability to monitor or control how they are used by recipients. In addition, migrants’ preferences on how remittances should be spent often differ from the recipients’ preferences. Migrants often have a stronger preference that remittances be used for purposes that may have general development benefits in the long run, such as investment (in physical or human capital) or savings.  Whereas recipients often favour using these funds for immediate consumption. This combination on differing preferences and limited control on funds leads to migrants sending fewer remittances than they otherwise might.
This project seeks to address this barrier by testing the impact of a simple, scalable and low-cost mechanism that allows migrants to both signal their preferences and exert greater control over the funds they send – labeled remittances. Migrants will be given the option to “label” their remittance with its intended purpose. The label will be transmitted to the beneficiary along with the remittance amount. Simple labeling can potentially allow migrants to direct remittances to particular uses, and research suggests that it may be as effective as more direct mechanisms of control. In addition, labeling remittances may be less costly and more easily scalable than other approaches for directing remittances to specific uses."
