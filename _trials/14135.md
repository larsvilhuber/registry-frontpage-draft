abstract: "In this study, I investigate the role of social networks and biases in access to opportunities. I focus on settings where such opportunities require third-party referrals, such as nominations and recommendations. For this, I conduct a natural field experiment in which university students are candidates for the offered opportunities and faculty members are referrers. Opportunities include access to an international training program as well as to the lottery of a valuable prize. I explore how the ties between candidates and referrers (social networks) influence the provision and receipt of referrals, potentially perpetuating biases that disadvantage certain groups in proactive help settings.

In the experiment, I provide faculty members with the opportunity to recommend students for the beneficial opportunities. By analyzing social network data, I can identify not only who receives recommendations but also who is excluded. I divide faculty members into two groups: the control group receives a message emphasizing academic merit, while the experimental group also receives a reminder not to discriminate based on sex, social class, or other demographics. This design allows me to uncover inherent biases in the recommendation process and assess the effectiveness of the awareness message in reducing these biases.

The findings from this experiment will provide insights into the presence and extent of biases in referral processes and the effectiveness of awareness interventions in mitigating these biases. I aim to inform strategies for enhancing access to opportunities for underrepresented groups by increasing awareness of potential biases."
