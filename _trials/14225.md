abstract: "Residents from low-income regions can find better education, jobs, and social opportunities in wealthier cities. Yet, they might not want to migrate due to pecuniary and non-pecuniary reasons. I am carrying out an RCT with around 1,000 Grade 12 students at one Chinese senior high school. These students, in their final year of secondary education, will soon decide whether and where to pursue undergraduate studies. Despite the low costs associated with relocating for educational purposes, the school’s administrative data indicates that the number of students choosing to relocate remains surprisingly low. My study explores whether and how revealing pecuniary and non-pecuniary returns of migrating in representative regions influences students’ perceived returns to migration, and subsequently affects their migration intentions and actual behaviors."
