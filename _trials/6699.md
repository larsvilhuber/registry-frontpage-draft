abstract: "Abstract
Background/Objectives: High job stress and associated symptomatology have been found to be widely common among teachers of Children with Neuro-developmental disorders (NDDs), with negative implications for the teachers, the schools, and the learners. Managing stress among teachers of learners with NDDs could improve their health, reduce turn over and improve overall school outputs. This study examined the effectiveness of Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy (REBT) in reducing job-stress among teachers of children with NDDs in Enugu state, Nigeria. Method: Participants (N= 63) included teachers of children with NDDs with not less than two years of working experience who were randomly assigned to immediate intervention (N=31) and waitlist group (N=32) groups. Immediate intervention group participants were exposed to 2 hours REBT program weekly for 12 weeks. Three measures were used to collect data at baseline, post-test and follow-up evaluations. Data collected were analyzed using t-test statistics, repeated measures ANOVA and bar charts. 
Results: Results revealed that the perceived stress and stress symptoms of the immediate intervention group at post-test and follow up assessments reduced significantly, compared to the waitlisted group. Change in occupational stress index sores across pre, post and follow-up measurements were minimal and could not account for a significant difference in the immediate intervention and waitlisted groups. 
Conclusion: Based on the findings of the present study, it is concluded that REBT is a cost-effective therapeutic approach that could be used in managing occupational stress in teachers of children with NDDs.
