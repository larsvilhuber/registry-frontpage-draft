abstract: "In this survey we are interested in personal financial advice about investments in stocks and funds. With personal advice, we refer to advice from your friends, acquaintances, colleagues, or family members about investments in stocks and funds. We will refer to this as family and friends. We define financial advice as providing or receiving opinions, suggestions, recommendations, or information related to financial matters, including how to invest or save, how to create wealth, or specifically which financial choices to make. The advice can be either in person or online.

Our goal is to understand what kind of personal financial advice individuals receive and what kind of personal financial advice individuals would give. We also want to understand who typically gives advice and who typically receives advice. Our main goal is to understand if individuals tend to recommend single stocks to their family and friends, or if they tend to recommend investing in funds. We also wish to understand the process of giving and receiving advice better.
