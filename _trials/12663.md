abstract: "This study explores the causal connection between psychological well-being and women’s empowerment, food security and nutrition. We develop a psychological training for female borrowers of BRAC’s microfinance and savings programs to enhance their meaning making, agency, and collaborative partnership with their husbands. We test the effect of this training through a randomized control trial in the Dhaka region of Bangladesh. Additionally, we develop a leaflet with information on key sanitation practices and implement a full factorial design with randomly providing the information session and leaflet to half the women in treatment groups and half in our control groups. Specifically, we test whether removing internal constraints for female clients of BRAC through psychology based empowerment training can improve women’s empowerment, their psychological well-being, their health, adoption of good sanitation behaviors, child health and household food security. We also undertake two additional survey experiments on health and sanitation; and child marriage."
