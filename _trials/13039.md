abstract: "We conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment to investigate how parents’, teachers’, and peers’ behavior and advice affect children’s pro-social behavior in poor neighborhoods in Colombia. Elementary school children conduct a real-effort task and choose to allocate time between working for their own benefit or for a needy child. Across treatments, they receive information on their parents’, teachers’, or student peers’ decisions or advice, which may influence their sharing decisions. Our findings could shed light on policymaking on effectively fostering prosociality in children from an early age. "
