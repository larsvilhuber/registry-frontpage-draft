abstract: "Performance contracts have been implemented in a variety of settings, yet there is mixed empirical evidence on whether performance pay actually matters for overall firm profits. Despite a recent shift towards performance-based contracts for online journalists, and oft-cited concerns about the impacts of this business model on the quality of journalism, no studies to date investigate the relationship between performance contracts and firm profits or journalistic quality in the market for news. In this project, we use a natural field experiment to study the impacts of pay-per-click contracts for journalists on writer
performance, firm profits, and journalistic quality in an online news firm. We seek to provide evidence on the tradeoffs between the strength of incentives and the effectiveness of contracting on outputs in a context where agents have (or can gain) specific knowledge about the returns to various actions. Our research design focuses on two main contributions: First, by combining random allocation to contract type with individual-level productivity beliefs, we can test whether stronger incentives increase the acquisition and use of information about marginal returns to writer effort. Second, by classifying article-level political and ethnic bias, we will study the effects of contract type on media bias, in an attempt to gain insights into the importance of supply- and demand-side sources of media bias."
