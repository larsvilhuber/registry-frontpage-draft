abstract: "
The Family Unification Program (FUP), which is funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), provides child welfare–involved families with permanent Housing Choice Vouchers. The program provides vouchers to families for whom the lack of adequate housing is a primary factor in (a) the imminent placement of the family’s child, or children, in out-of-home care or (b) the delay in the discharge of the child, or children, to the family from out-of-home-care. The program aims to prevent children’s placement in out-of-home care, promote family reunification for children placed in out-of-home care, and decrease new reports of abuse and neglect.   

The goal of the evaluation is to determine whether FUP increased family preservation and reunification for families receiving vouchers and associated services, document how the program is implemented across the sites, and identify how the variations in implementation across sites might explain impact differences across sites. This evaluation has two main components, an implementation study and an impact study. The impact study examines the effect that the program had on outcomes, using quantitative data collection and analysis. The impact study will employ a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 5-10 sites across the United States. The evaluation will randomly assign families to be referred either to receive a FUP voucher or to receive services as usual.  The study will follow all randomized families in the sites in the evaluation.  The implementation study examines how the program is executed, the context of FUP within each site's child welfare and housing policies and practices, and the successes and challenges faced by the child welfare and housing agencies.
