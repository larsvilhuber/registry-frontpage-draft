abstract: "The covid-19 pandemic has forced 1.5 billion schoolchildren in 160 countries to stay at home while schools were shut down on sanitary grounds. While several distance learning tools have been put in place in developing countries, a variety of factors raise critical concerns about learning deficits and school dropouts when schools are back, particularly amongst the most vulnerable students. This paper investigates whether sending reminders and encouragement messages to high-school students in Brazil during the pandemic increases attendance and assignment completion when it comes to distance learning, and decreases grade repetition and dropout rates in the aftermath.
