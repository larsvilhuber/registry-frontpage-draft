abstract: "An increasingly complex socio-economic landscape has recently highlighted the importance of decision-making under uncertainty. Making decisions under conditions of uncertainty is crucial to technological innovation, social change, and the creation of new ideas, and it is at the core of entrepreneurship. However, evidence suggests that entrepreneurs lack a method to make decisions under conditions of uncertainty. This project extends prior work that shows that entrepreneurs can improve their ability to make these decisions by adopting a scientific approach based on the formulation of models tested with data, such as scientists do. It proposes to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to provide solid evidence and test the effects of the adoption of this approach vis-a-vis another approach to decision-making, effectuation. By scientific approach to entrepreneurial decision making, we mean that entrepreneurs should behave like scientists, accurately framing and identifying the problem they wish to address, articulating theories, defining clear hypotheses, conducting rigorous tests to prove or disprove these hypotheses, measuring the results of the tests, and making decisions based on these tools. By effectuation, we mean that entrepreneurs use a non-predictive approach whereby they identify the next, best step by assessing the resources available, while continuously balancing the interests of self-selected stakeholders with their resources.
Building on two pilot studies (RCTs) conducted in Italy and involving 116 and 250  founders of new startups, we are conducting another RCT with 800 entrepreneurs to understand the conditions under which different approaches to decision-making sustain entrepreneurial action. "
