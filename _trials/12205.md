abstract: "In July 2022, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (the department) replaced jobactive with Workforce Australia. The introduction of Workforce Australia included one key change, the Points Based Activation System (PBAS), a system which gives Workforce Australia individuals the flexibility and choice in deciding which activities and tasks to meet their mutual obligation requirements each monthly reporting period.
Under PBAS, individuals are set a number of points, or a ‘points target’, they need to achieve each reporting period. This points target is tailored to consider individuals’ personal circumstances and their local labour market conditions.
To complement this system, this research will test a ‘PBAS Points Planner’ tool that aims to help Workforce Australia individuals self-managing online understand, plan for, and meet their mutual obligations. The tool will be accompanied by personalised messaging throughout individuals’ reporting period, highlighting their progress towards their PBAS points target and/or minimum job search requirements."
