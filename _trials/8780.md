abstract: "One key barrier to unlocking higher-value markets for farmers investing in quality upgrading is quality certification. Provision of certification services at a local level before aggregation may be important to overcome the information asymmetry on quality between farmers and downstream buyers and unlock price premiums for farmers. However, quality testing is costly in many contexts and could eat up a substantial portion of the available premium. Coordination among farmers to jointly test their production could significantly reduce costs of quality assessment.  Coordination is also risky and requires trust between farmers that everyone involved has invested in quality. This project aims to test whether farmers are aware of the quality investments made by other nearby farmers, and whether the provision of third-party information about the quality investments of nearby farmers encourages coordination.
