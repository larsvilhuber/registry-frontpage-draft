abstract: "The goal of this study is to estimate the effect of deadlines and reminders on firms seeking out credit during an economic downturn due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Credit can be valuable to firms to weather the downturn but its benefits are in the future when the cost to obtain one is borne immediately. Forgetfulness and present-bias might be biases that exacerbate the cost and lead firms to not ever search and request a loan. We will study if treatments involving deadlines and reminders (anticipated and unanticipated) helps firms overcome these biases to search for a loan."
