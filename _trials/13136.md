abstract: "The recent rise of the far-right, particularly in European democracies, has motivated a sizeable body of research on the determinants of voting for such parties, which often rely on inflammatory statements that may or not be factual. 

In this project, we provide respondents from a representative sample of eligible voters in the 2022 general election with statements from, or about, members of a far-right party on different subjects, and provide them additional context that validates or disproves the statements. We study whether the subject of the statement, and the provision of additional context symmetrically affect perceptions of respondents about the credibility of the statements, and the members of the party, as well as the effect of the statements and corresponding context on voting behaviour in a general election. 

To this effect, we survey respondents both before and after the election. We also study how sociodemographic and political characteristics  of potential voters (e.g. being undecided in the week prior to the election)  may condition the effect of the statements (or the context provided) affects the propensity to vote, and the probability of voting for certain parties.
