abstract: "Intimate partner violence (IPV) is increasingly recognized as a major threat to global health and well-being. As a relatively new area of study and direct intervention, there are a small number of evidence-based strategies for reducing IPV and the causal pathways through which these strategies reduce IPV are often unclear. The Modern Man Challenge (MMC) study seeks to address some of these gaps by exploring new ways to mitigate and prevent IPV in a low-income, post-conflict setting by targeting behavior change in men delivered on a scalable platform. The MMC promotes gender-equitable, violence-free relationships by directly linking men to guidance on shared household management, sex-positive communication skills, joint financial planning, and emotional regulation skills. The strategies and methods developed by MMC emerged from a combination of human-centered design, field-wide “best practices”, and research on effective behavior change across a range of outcomes. Through a series of iterative prototyping and programmatic testing beginning in 2017, these concepts have been tailored to fit the Liberian context and encourage participation. These previous programmatic tests have laid the groundwork for this study, which will assess the impact of this program through a small-scale cluster-randomized study in Monrovia, Liberia.
