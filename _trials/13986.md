abstract: "We conduct an online survey-based randomized experiment among a large sample of German household heads to investigate how perceptions of their homes' energy efficiency performance influence their attitudes toward climate policies, particularly support for a Minimum Energy Performance Standard aimed at the most inefficient buildings. First, we explore respondents' misperceptions regarding their dwellings' energy efficiency relative to the national building stock. We then assess whether providing personalized information on their homes' relative energy efficiency standing affects respondents' climate policy preferences. Additionally, we examine whether this information influences owner-occupiers' willingness to pay for expert advice on energy efficiency retrofitting. To isolate the effect of our treatment through a personal burden mechanism, we employ a fuzzy regression discontinuity design by varying the scope of the proposed energy performance standard. Our study aims to contribute to the understanding of the relationship between personal compliance costs and public support for ambitious climate policies.
