abstract: "In this project, we investigate whether social exclusion affects performance. Social
exclusion is psychologically costly, and could also signal low ability. We incorporate
these two aspects of social exclusion in a model that shows that (i) irrespective of the
cause of social exclusion, being excluded decreases subsequent performance, (ii) the
possibility of future social exclusion increases average performance, and (iii) excluded
persons adjust their beliefs about their own ability downwards hence exert lower effort.
We test these predictions using a laboratory experiment. The experimental results will
inform us whether social exclusion indeed lowers performance and the mechanisms
behind it."
