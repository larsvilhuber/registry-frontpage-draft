abstract: "This document presents the pre-analysis plan of a randomized control trial experiment that has been conducted in Salima district of Malawi. The intervention has been completed, but the follow-up data collection has not started. 

This project aims at measuring the impact of interventions designed to increase patience in mothers on investments in children. It randomly varies the content of those trainings to design an optimal policy to increase investments in children. In one treatment arm the training encourages mothers to be more patient when it comes to their own wealth and consumption; in another, the mothers are encouraged to be more patient when they make decisions relating to their children. It then assesses which type of intervention is more effective in increasing investments in children, depending on the mothers' relative discounting of their and their children's consumption. 

The attached pre-analysis plan  outlines the theoretical model, the experimental design, the outcome variables and the econometric methods I will use to assess the effectiveness of the trainings."
