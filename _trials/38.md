abstract: "This experiment assesses whether financial incentives can increase healthcare counselors’ motivation, and therefore their detection and treatment of TB. Ninety-six counselors from Operation ASHA and 51 field extension workers from CARE India were randomly assigned to either the treatment group—which received financial rewards for each new patient enrolled in the DOTS system—or the comparison group—which received a fixed salary. After six months, the health workers were re-assigned at random to either a new treatment group, in which they were financially penalized for each patient that defaulted on their treatment, or the comparison group, in which they received a fixed salary. We are evaluating the impact of the incentives—both positive and negative—on counselors’ motivation and commitment to their job, and on the detection of and treatment compliance for TB.

In another arm of the project, we are testing the impact of improving monitoring of health worker’s efforts and patient compliance through the introduction of biometric technology in TB control centers. Operation ASHA has developed a biometric system based on a fingerprint scanner connected to a low-end computer and cellphone. Health workers as well as patients identify themselves when they come to the center. The data is then sent by SMS several times per day to a server located in Delhi, and alerts and reminders are sent to health workers when noncompliance is detected. 
We are evaluating the impact of these two strategies (performance-based incentives and the biometric monitoring tool) on the number of TB patients detected, the number of defaults, and a range of intermediary outcomes such as health workers’ motivation, provider absenteeism, and the quality of service delivery perceived by patients."
