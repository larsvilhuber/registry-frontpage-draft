abstract: "Background
There are large differences in health, cognition, and behavioural problems, between children of different socio-economic groups, even at very early ages. These gaps do not shrink over the time. This is true both in developed and developing countries. 

We have a very little rigorous evidence in scaling up process on parenting interventions to improve child development. To improve child development outcomes, the training programs in parenting skills based in health primary care would be a relatively lower cost than other interventions.

Significant changes in child development associated with family characteristics, especially the primary caregiver / a. 

Several longitudinal studies with large samples realize that the mean scores on cognitive and noncognitive measurements in children vary significantly according to socioeconomic status (Paxson and Shady (2007), Fernald, Weber, and Ratsifandrihamanana Galasso (2011), Gertler et al (2012), Bravo et al (2013)). 

But also these gradients are also observed indicators of family environment, parenting practices and stimulation as well as beliefs and attitudes toward aging and mental health of self caregiver (Badev and Cunha (2012), Kohn (1963), Alwin (1984), Luster et al, (1989), Behrman and Rosenzweig (2002), Bandura (1977)).


Study design

The impact evaluation methodology is based on a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) with pre- and post-intervention measurements, with the primary care center as main cluster unit and second primary caregiver and children under 6 years age of households participating in the study. Since the program was able to cover only a small fraction of the target population, the implementation of a Clinical Trial Aletarorizado was considered as a viable and desirable to assess the impact of this intervention. Therefore each health center elaborated a long waiting list for NEP. On average in the country this list was 45 people. From each list a group of families (about 20) was invited to the basic program immediately, another of the same size was invited to the intensive program and another group of the same size that you may be on the waiting list of at least 12 months. The group on the waiting list will receive NEP as it becomes available in the months following the second evaluation. Randomization, data collection

Intervention
The study assesses the impact of the Canadian original program (NEP Basic), but also evaluates a form with two additional sessions of parent-child interaction developed in Chile (NEP Intensive). Both interventions were compared with a control group in a study involving 175 primary care centers, involving more 3,000 families across the country. Parents in the active group attended 6-8 group education sessions for parents of an intervention based on Experiential Learning Theory (ELT) and problem-based (PBL) learning. The second intervention arm received an intervention based on behavioral modeling and reinforcement of content covered in the sessions for parents and children. A control group received usual care from APS, including visits healthy child and unstructured parent education sessions. A professional from primary health care centre trained on program Nobody's Perfect is who leads the sessions of the two active treatment groups.


Objectives
The main objective of the evaluation is focused on quantitatively estimate the impact of NEP in positive changes in the long term associated with better indicators of child development and changes in the family environment. Simultaneously, it is also our aim to estimate the impact on exchange mediators short- and medium-term changes parental beliefs and attitudes, confidence and self-image as parents and caregivers, and changes in cognitive and socioemotional practices stimulation. Aware of the importance of evaluating an intervention climbing at national, universal level, and low cost of implementation, it is also our aim to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention and provide recommendations for improvement and innovation policy based on quantitative analysis.
The research questions are:
Can a structured and group parenting skills program based on working with primary caregivers, encourage improvements in knowledge about child development and the benefits of cognitive stimulation and socio-emotional?
Is the intervention able to change beliefs and attitudes that parents and primary caregivers have for raising children, to parenting styles associated with a better combination of levels of affection and structure? Does it increase the perception of parental self-efficacy and perceived social support?
Is the intervention able to improve the mental health of parents and primary caregivers? Are the results translate into lower levels of stress and depression related to parenting?
Is the intervention able to generate detectable medium-term changes in the practices of cognitive and social-emotional stimulation with children? Does it generate the intervention a decrease in the use of violent disciplinary strategies?
Will improving practices parenting result in detectable changes in the development of cognitive and non-cognitive skills, physical and mental health of the child? What is the potential added value of the results in implementing development scale a version of the intervention that incorporates parent-child interaction, adding gaming sessions and caregiver-child language (a)?

Hypothesis

The mean of cognitive and socio-emotional skills in children of primary caregivers who receive Basic NEP is at least 0.25 standard deviations higher than the control children around 18 months after completing the program,
Households receiving NEP Basic achieve a difference in the average of at least 0.25 standard deviations on indicators of environmental quality and socio-cognitive stimulation and emotional at home compared with the control group at about 18 months after completion the program
Caregivers who receive NEP Basic achieve a reduction in the average of at least 0.25 standard deviations) in the questionnaire related to parenting stress compared to the control group at about 18 months after completing the program
The cost-effectiveness of intensive NEP, measured in terms of indicators of child development, is estimated at at least 25% greater than the basic mode.
Active intervention is most effective about 18 months between caregivers with major depression and / or low social support scores at baseline.

Secondary outcomes



As far as we are aware this is the first randomised controlled trial to assess the impact of a parenting skills program based on health primary care implemented at national level in a developing country. These results could be contributed to implement early childhood development programs based on evidence in low and middle-income countries."
