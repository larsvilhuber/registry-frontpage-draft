abstract: "We experimentally investigate the effect of gift exchange in markets for credence goods. In such markets an expert-seller diagnoses the extent of a consumers’ problem, performs the treatment and finally charges a price for his services. The consumer is never informed about the extent of his problem and he cannot verify the treatment performed by the expert-seller. Consequently expert-sellers have incentives to exploit the informational asymmetries by performing inefficient treatments. Such market inefficiencies have been documented in both laboratory and field studies. In our laboratory study, we give the consumer the possibility to gift the expert-seller, either unconditionally or conditional on receiving efficient services. Theories on other regarding behavior predict that the expert-seller will reciprocate to gifts thereby performing more efficient services. We expect to confirm this hypothesis, which allows us to draw novel implications on how to prevent fraudulent services of experts."
