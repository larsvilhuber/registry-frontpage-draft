abstract: "The aim of this study is to present descriptive and causal evidence on the role of the social environment in shaping the accuracy of self-assessment. We introduce a novel incentivized measurement tool to measure the accuracy of self-assessment among children and use this tool to compare children from high socioeconomic status (SES) families to children from low SES families. To move beyond correlational evidence, we will explore the effects of the randomized participation in a mentoring program designed to enrich the social environment of children. "
