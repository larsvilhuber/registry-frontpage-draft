abstract: "Quality journalism can make scientific publications and statistics accessible for the general public. Yet, numerous studies reveal that many journalists lack proficiency in statistical analysis. To improve the statistical literacy of journalists, we have developed a concise educational video focusing on the accurate interpretation of scientific studies and statistics. The video addresses key topics such as (random) sampling, computation and interpretation of probabilities, differences between correlation and causation, and identification of misleading figures.
To assess the efficacy of the video, we recruit trained journalists through a mailing list of the German Journalistic Association. These journalists are randomly assigned to either the treatment or a control group (between-subject design). The treatment group receives the video immediately, the control group only after the experiment. All participants are asked to assess several news articles on scientific studies in terms of their accuracy. Computing differences in means between treatment and control group gives an estimate about the efficacy of the video."
