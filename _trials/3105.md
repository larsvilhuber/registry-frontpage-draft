abstract: "How to hold education and health service providers accountable for the quality of services they deliver, and how to empower service users to voice their concerns, is a question relevant across all contexts. A collaboration of three NGOs in Bangladesh has been piloting an innovative approach to achieve this objective. The child-led social accountability (CLSA) approach involves organising and informing groups of children to monitor quality of services provided at education and health facilities, hold discussions with service providers to determine actions to address their concerns, and follow up on progress against the agreed actions. This study evaluates the impact of the CLSA approach."
