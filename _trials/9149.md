abstract: "Food systems account for approximately 26% of global greenhouse gases, with high variation in carbon footprints across different types of food. Despite the food system's large contribution to climate change, most consumers are unaware of how their food choices impact the climate. We partner with a large meal kit company in the US to test the impacts of menu labels indicating the relative carbon impact of meals in an RCT with over 100,000 customers. We will test the impacts of these labels on key administrative outcomes, like meal choices, customer retention, and customer referrals. We complement this large-scale experiment with a survey experiment in a sample recruited from Facebook,  where we will test the impacts of carbon labels on knowledge, beliefs, and other pro-environmental behaviors."
