abstract: "Achieving the United Nationâ€™s ambitious target of eliminating open defecation by 2025 demands a thorough understanding of binding constraints to toilet uptake by households. In particular, adoption of safe toilets by poor households is thought to be restricted by credit and informational constraints. Safe toilets entail large investments, accounting for several months of household income for even basic low-cost options. Moreover, households may be unaware of the costs and benefits of safe sanitation. In this study, we consider the impacts of alleviating these constraints on the uptake of safe sanitation in rural India. We do so using a cluster randomised control trial in rural Maharashtra, where we randomly allocate 120 Gram Panchayats (GPs) to one of three arms: (i) access to micro-credit loans for sanitation; (ii) access to micro-credit loans for sanitation, and awareness creation activities; and (iii) a control arm where neither of these interventions was offered. Micro-credit loans could be accessed by the clients of our partner microfinance institution only. In addition to the uptake of safe sanitation, we will also consider whether the interventions improve usage of safe sanitation, and toilet quality, whether they change perceptions of costs and benefits of safe sanitation, and whether microcredit for sanitation crowds out investments on other dimensions, e.g. business. Finally, the design will also allow us to shed light on whether poor households are credit constrained, and not simply credit rationed, for sanitation investments.
