abstract: "This research seeks to evaluate the relative efficiency of various strategies to fortify school meals with an emphasis on minimizing leakages and improving the quality of service delivery in India’s Midday Meal program. The meals will be fortified with a micronutrient mix to target widespread nutrient deficiencies. Using randomized-control-trial methodology, we will compare (i) fortification through centralized meal provision and (ii) fortification through current, decentralized, meal provision, as well as a variation of the latter in the form of top-down monitoring. We will evaluate the impact of these strategies on fortification take-up, meal quality, child health, and schooling outcomes."
