abstract: "In this project we plan to use a field experiment that exposes citizens to a large-scale Facebook advertisement campaign encouraging them to report electoral misdeeds around the 2019 Colombian elections. Our experimental design will allow us to study four separate questions: (1) whether their exists a demand for online reporting tools; (2) whether candidates reduce their electoral misdeeds when informed about these types of campaigns; (3) if candidates engage in \textit{signal jamming} of the reporting website strategically; (4) if this type of campaigns induce secondary effects on citizens' voting decisions by increasing the salience of electoral misdeeds.
