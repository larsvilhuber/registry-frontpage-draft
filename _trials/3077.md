abstract: "Background: Despite significant improvements in health and development indicators in Bangladesh in recent years, child marriage remains stubbornly high, with about half of women 20-24 reporting being married by age 18, and social norms around early marriage persist.
Methods:  To examine whether a social norms intervention can be an effective intervention to address child marriage, we designed a multi-arm randomized cluster trial. This project, called Accelerating Action to End Child Marriage in Bangladesh, is designed to reach adolescent girls ages 10-19 residing in two child marriage hot spot districts of Bangladesh. The program to be implemented in 72 randomly selected communities, while another 24 randomly-selected communities are serving as controls. Impact is assessed through baseline, midline and endline surveys and qualitative data collection is planned to provide data with which to target and improve intervention strategies. 
Discussion: The project is expected to identify ways to scale up skill-building activities along with alternative community participation strategies to ensure the long-term sustainability of the program effect across the community. The project will evaluate a skill-building program that is girl-centered, cost effective, sustainable, and community owned that will contribute the countryâ€™s overall initiative to end child marriage. The research will edify the policy makers through evidence-based skill-building interventions by adding and evaluating a new community engagement component. The project will document intervention strategies in detail and provided cost effectiveness estimates of the three approaches applied in intervention. It will generate approaches as well as materials to gather programmatic evidence of relevance to future programming.
