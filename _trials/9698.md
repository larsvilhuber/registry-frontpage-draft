abstract: "In a world of incomplete information, individuals make decisions based on more or less precise beliefs about their own ability. One important determinant in the formation of beliefs about one’s ability are comparisons to others. This study’s aims are twofold: i) understanding the individual determinants of the demand for relative feedback as well as ii) understanding the effects of receiving individual feedback about one’s own performance on job search."
