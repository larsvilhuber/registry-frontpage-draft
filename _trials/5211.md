abstract: "This study involves collecting forecasts of results of three field experiments.  We randomly vary four features when eliciting forecasts: (1) small versus large reference values in an example preceding the predictions; (2) whether forecasts are in standard deviations or raw units;  (3) slider versus text-entry responses; and (4) small versus large slider bounds."
