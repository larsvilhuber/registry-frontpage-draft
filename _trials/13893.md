abstract: "The project will use an online survey organisation to run a survey experiment that aims to understand the attitudes of a representative sample of the UK population, towards causes, consequences, and feasible policy solutions to persistent gaps in economic outcomes between ethnic/racial groups in the UK. The questions asked would focus on perception of economics differences along ethnic/racial lines, perceived understanding of the causes of the differences and attitudes towards possible policy solutions. The participants would be asked to complete an online questionnaire and the data collected would the answers provided by the respondents to the said questionnaire. The proposed method, an online survey, allows the collection of the data and will include an experimental variation that involves up-front priming respondents in different ways."
