abstract: "We analyze to what extent work meaning - the significance of a job for others or for society - increases the willingness to accept a job and job performance of employed and unemployed individuals. To this end, we conduct an online experiment with student subjects. In the experiment, we offer a job that can be completed from home. We elicit subjects’ reservation wage for this job through the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak mechanism. The treatment variation is the description of the job as having either “high” or “low” meaning. If work meaning increases labor supply, the average reservation wage should be smaller in the treatment with “high” meaning."
