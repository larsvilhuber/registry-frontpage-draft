abstract: "To study how information affect people’s views on carbon pricing, we conduct an online survey experiment in a representative sample of the German population. We show that providing information about the efficiency of carbon pricing as well as providing information about emission levels and national carbon pricing initiatives changes people’s perceptions and improves their support. Providing information about the distributional implications of carbon pricing—including the possibility to reverse disadvantageous distributional effects through revenue recycling—is, however, not effective. Moreover, we show that the effectiveness of the information treatments depends on trust in the government and attitudes toward climate change."
