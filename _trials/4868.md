abstract: "A large literature examines the effect of social comparisons in nudging individuals towards conservation and pro-social behavior.  This study builds on this literature by analyzing the salience of social comparisons in determining resource use behavior in the novel context of groundwater use among agricultural producers. We utilize a randomized controlled trail to measure how the provision of information comparing an individual’s past annual groundwater use to that of other groundwater users in their district affects the individual’s future groundwater use.
