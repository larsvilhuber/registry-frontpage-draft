abstract: "The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (Pub. L. 116-6) and the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (Pub. L. 116-94) authorized HUD to implement and evaluate the Community Choice Demonstration. As described in the Federal Register Notice Docket Number FR-6191-N-01, HUD is implementing a multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test and evaluate the effectiveness of the Demonstration. The primary purposes of the Demonstration are to provide voucher assistance and mobility-related services to families with children to encourage such families to move to lower-poverty areas, to expand their access to opportunity areas, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategies pursued under the Demonstration (AEARCTR-0009805). 

The Mobility Opportunity Vouchers to Eliminate Disparities (MOVED) Study builds on the Demonstration and will investigate how and for whom neighborhoods shape obesity and diabetes risk by sampling 900 adults and children enrolled in the Community Choice Demonstration across 3 sites (Pittsburgh, PA; Cuyahoga, OH; and Nashville, TN). Researchers will collect baseline and 2-year follow-up data for one adult and one child in each household in the comprehensive mobility services group and the control group, will assess obesity and diabetes risk among adults (measured BMI and HbA1c) and obesity among children (measured BMI z-score) and will examine mechanisms by which housing mobility may impact health outcomes, including behavioral (adult-diet, physical activity, sleep), psychosocial (adult-mental health, social support), contextual (food outlets, walkability, health care access), and structural (family-racial discrimination, exposure to violence, neighborhood segregation, collective efficacy, utilization of social services) factors using surveys, accelerometry, and geospatial analyses. Specifically, the proposed research aims to:

Aim 1. Investigate (a) the extent to which adults who receive comprehensive mobility services (“treatment group”) exhibit changes in obesity and diabetes risk (BMI and HbA1c) after 2 years compared to a control group (no mobility services), and (b) the extent to which children in the treatment group exhibit changes in obesity (BMI z-score) after 2 years compared to a control group. We will explore whether these relationships vary by baseline characteristics.

Aim 2. Examine whether adults and families in the treatment group exhibit changes in behavioral, psychosocial, contextual, and structural factors after 2 years relative to the control group. We will explore to what extent these factors mediate changes in adult obesity and diabetes risk and changes in child obesity risk.
