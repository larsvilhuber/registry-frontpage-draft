abstract: "This study aims to evaluate an intervention to help address the lack of information among small-scale farmers on the latest improved agricultural technologies and lack of information and linkages to markets. Through the Scaling up Radio and ICTs for Enhanced Extension Delivery (SRIEED) II project, Farm Radio Trust-Malawi and its partners aims to address this issue by implementing various ICT-based interventions in six districts in Malawi from 2020 to 2025.  One of the major components is strengthening existing community-based producer groups as impact ICT hubs.  These groups will be supported with a package of services including radios, facilitation in market platforms, assistance in collective marketing and aggregation, and linkages to input suppliers, service providers, and financial institutions. These hubs are targeted as centers for providing demand-driven extension and models for early adopters of agricultural and marketing innovations in the rural communities. A total of 118 groups were identified to be supported in the course of the project in two phases, with the first batch to be supported first followed by the second batch to be supported in the second around second or third year of the project. 

This  study aims to evaluate the impact of these hubs on the income of the groups' members. As a secondary outcome, this study aims to measure the spillover of information and influence of these impact ICT hubs on access to information and changes in practices among the other farmers of the community. 

The study is set-up as a cluster-randomized controlled trial, with the producer groups as unit of randomization and households as the unit of analysis. Of the 118 producer groups identified, half are assigned as treatment group, and the other half as control group.  We take advantage of the phased or staggered approach of the project to set-up a cRCT with the randomly assigned treatment group to serve as first batch and those in the control group to serve as the second batch for the interventions.
