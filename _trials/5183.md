abstract: "First, we ask how leaders mobilize participation to solve collective action problems characterized by free-riding, such as labor or social movements. Second, we conduct an in-depth skill assessment of approximately 1500 garment workers in Myanmar to assess the distribution of skills at the sector level. These objectives are connected because we conduct this research in the run-up to a minimum wage revision due to happen in May 2020. Within this context, we collaborate with a national umbrella organization for labor unions in Myanmar, the Confederation of Trade Unions Myanmar (CTUM). In collaboration with the CTUM, we implement two surveys: one on union membership, leadership and skill assessment and one on living costs. We liaise with 28 unions at the factory-level that are affiliated with the CTUM. To ensure sample representativeness, we randomly sample workers inside the factories, stratifying on factory, union membership, and skill level. We exploit the minimum wage momentum to embed multiple experiments among the set of CTUM’s activities dedicated to raise workers’ awareness and elicit workers’ views on the minimum wage level. We experimentally vary different treatment conditions to understand in what ways leaders may be effective in solving collective action problems."
