abstract: "We want to understand how two-parent heterosexual households in the USA react to information from academic articles in making choices. We do so by embedding an experiment in a survey where we randomize whether the information from the academic article is about more generic advice versus a message about a study which finds that if the childâ€™s father emails the school and indicates that the mother has limited availability, about 90% of responses from the school will be directed to the father.
