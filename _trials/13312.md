abstract: "Plastic waste is a global threat. Prior studies find that “green nudges” are effective in reducing the use of single-use cutleries (SUC) in food deliveries. To our surprise, we find, in a pilot study, that restaurants still give out SUCs in food deliveries despite customers choosing the “no cutlery” option. The objective of the study is to explore why restaurants still give out SUCs and potential mechanisms to reduce this behavior. We further explore short-term and long-term effects of the treatments. Our study intends to provide actionable insights that could lead to more successful environmental policies and thereby contributing to the global effort to mitigate plastic waste."
