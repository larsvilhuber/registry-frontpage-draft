abstract: "This study evaluates experimentally the long-term impacts of temporary wage subsidies on employment in North Macedonia. The target group consists of vulnerable unemployed individuals applying to an employment program that provides employers with a subsidy covering 50% of wage payments during the initial year of employment, alongside training expenses. Applicants are first matched to a job opening, and then randomly selected to attend the job interview with the employer, who decides whether to hire the interviewee under the programâ€™s conditions. We estimate impacts on employment using administrative records, and on employment and skill accumulation using survey data."
