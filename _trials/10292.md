abstract: "We study how perceived forecast variance affects how consumers update their inflation expectations in a randomized control trial. We elicit participants' 12-month ahead inflation expectations and provide them with one of five different pieces of inflation news. We hypothesize that a consumer who receives a high-variance inflation signal updates their beliefs by less relative to a consumer who receives a low-variance signal. To explain this phenomenon, we develop a structural model where consumers update their inflation beliefs through a Kalman filtering process. These findings indicate that times of high uncertainty cause persistent expectations, which can in turn cause elevated inflation to persist."
