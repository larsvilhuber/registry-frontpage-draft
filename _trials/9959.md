abstract: "Three self-adaption sequence exercise program groups, three Chinese traditional exercise program groups, a resistance training group (RT), and a control group (CG) were established for the participants. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the groups using the random number table method. The intervention programs were carried out by four teachers of Tai Chi and four instructors of fitness, and there were a total of six registered nurses present at each training session. We carried out a study of an intervention that lasted for 24 weeks with three times training every week, beginning on June 1 and ending on December 30, 2019. During the course of the trial, participants agreed that they would refrain from engaging in any other kind of physical exercise. "
