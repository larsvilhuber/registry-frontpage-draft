abstract: "We use a housing lottery in Ethiopia to assess the causal impact of wealth on attitudes and well-being. A new lottery allows us to investigate the short run effects of the lottery for a set of new winners. In particular, 40 percent of our previous losers have now won. We therefore interview our whole sample again. Most questions are identical, but we add some modifications and changes that are described in this plan. The analysis of the new winners will also be slightly different and we pre-register those decisions here.  "
