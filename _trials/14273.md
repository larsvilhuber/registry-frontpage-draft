abstract: "This document outlines the analysis plan for a cluster-randomized controlled trial of the effect of BÃºssola I.A., a human trafficking case management prioritization support tool on labor trafficking case detection in Brazil. The project is part of ``Comprehensive Action towards Forced labor Eradication (CAFE).'' The experiment will test whether federal labor prosecutors using the decision support tool to prioritize cases for task force investigations yields improved task-force-related outcomes. This pre-analysis plan provides intervention details, methodology, and a plan for analyzing the results of the experiment."
