abstract: "As part of the Phase 3: Asbestos National Strategic Plan 2024-2030 (ANSP), the Asbestos and Silica Safety and Eradication Agency (ASSEA) aims to encourage the safe removal of asbestos from Australian residences. ​ 

For residential buildings, the cost of asbestos removal, disposal and replacement is the main impediment to removal (Ipsos 2018). Hypothetical government initiatives that reduced this cost for homeowners (e.g. subsidised removal or disposal, low or no interest loans, and tax concessions) have been associated with higher reported willingness to remove asbestos (Ipsos 2018).​ 

Trial aims 
Estimate the impact that information about the increasing risk of asbestos (due to its increasing age) can have on the amount participants are willing to pay to remove asbestos (Randomised Controlled Trial). "
