abstract: "Young people with low educational qualifications find it difficult to enter the labour market, especially in Italy. The problem of the transition from school to work is particularly serious for vocational school students, whose employment rates remain consistently lower than those of other school leavers. 

The aim of this research is to test pilot interventions for vocational schools aimed at improving access to employment for young graduates. Specifically, the project aims at implement and evaluate the impact of two different activities: a job counselling program for students (Treatment A) and a training program for teachers (Treatment B), both provided by private employment agencies. Activities are designed for final-year vocational school students and their teachers.

Both of these proposed activities will include job search guidance, which will be delivered by specialized job coaches with expertise in supporting young job seekers and a deep understanding of the local labour markets. The professionals responsible for conducting the counselling and training sessions will be supplied by Adecco, a leading private employment agency in Italy. 

During the proposed activities, job coaches – in collaboration with or through teachers – will provide practical information about the employment prospects of the students, the importance of specific skills, how to write an effective CV, how to search for a job, how to apply for a job and how to present themselves in a job interview. 

We randomly select schools into participation in the project, and then into the two treatment and control group. Finally, among schools assigned to the student treatment we randomly select a school track out of the six eligible ones."
