abstract: "Approximately 2.2 billion people, reflecting 38% of the world's population, live in areas with iodine deficiency. Iodine deficiency disorders (IDDs) is the worlds’ leading cause of preventable brain damage and mental retardation. Knowledge about Iodine nutrition benefits and iodine deficiency disorders is an important tool in reducing the current indices of IDDs. This study thus assessed the effect of iodine nutrition education intervention among women of reproductive age in Obudu and Obanliku LGAs of Cross River State, Nigeria. Cluster-randomized controlled trial study design was employed for the study. Pocock’s formula was used to arrive at a sample size of 480. Iodized salt coverage at the household level and urinary iodine concentration (UIC) levels in a sub-set of the sample were also determined. Majority of participants 204(42.5%) were aged 25-34, most 332(69.2%) were married and while 181() had secondary education, 183() had tertiary level education. The characteristics of both groups were similar at baseline. Majority of respondents in the intervention group 134(55.8%) and the control group 125(52.1%) had marginally good knowledge score of iodine nutrition at Baseline. After the intervention there was a 42.9% increase in good knowledge in the intervention group while only a 1.6% increase was observed in the control group. Effect of nutrition intervention on knowledge of iodine nutrition benefits was statistically significant t (239) = 18.149, p < 0.001. Baseline Knowledge of iodine deficiency disorders was predominantly poor among both groups as only 25.8% in the control group and 21.3% in the intervention group had good knowledge scores. After the intervention, there was a 67.9% increase in the proportion of participants with good knowledge in the intervention group. The effect of the intervention was found to be statistically significant t (239) = 18.149, p < 0.001. At baseline also, the same proportion of participants across both groups 171(71.3%) had overall good practice scores regarding the use of iodized salt. After the nutrition education intervention, there was considerable increase in good practice score for participants in the intervention group by 22% while the control group saw a slight increase by 4.5%, the effect of the intervention on practice was however, statistically significant t (239) = 7.69, p < 0.001. Iodized salt coverage of the study area was 76.2% which is below the acceptable threshold of 90% and so poses a potential risk for iodine deficiency in the study area. Urinary Iodine concentration levels in the sub-set tested indicated that majority of the women 110(45.8%) had had mild deficiency and 15(6.3%) had moderate deficiency while 105(43.8%) had optimal UIC levels. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the effectiveness of nutrition education intervention on both outcome variables (knowledge and practice) and recommends that targeted iodine nutrition education should be carried out for women of reproductive age as well as health workers across various settings to reduce the incidence and future consequences of iodine deficiency disorders in Nigeria."
