abstract: "Cryptocurrencies offer a new investment opportunity and potential form of money. There is much unknown about the typical characteristics of cryptocurrency owners, and this information could be beneficial to both government regulators and cryptocurrency companies. To uncover ownership characteristics we analyze participants’ knowledge of and openness towards cryptocurrencies. In a previous study, we evaluated unincentivized measures of the willingness to own cryptocurrencies after receiving a positive message about them. To test the validity of these unincentivized measures, here, we conduct a separate laboratory experiment with students from George Mason University. In addition to verifying the survey results, this experiment tests the effect of providing subjects with an initial payment in cryptocurrencies, to determine if this can overcome individuals’ aversion to crypto ownership. We also study how risk preferences and trusting behavior are affected by the incorporation of cryptocurrencies."
