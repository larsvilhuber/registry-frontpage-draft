abstract: "We study the mechanism of why default nudge works. To investigate this question, we consider three factors suggested in the literature; ease, endowment, and endorsement. To consider how these factors affect default nudge, we conduct an online experiment and a fMRI experiment. In these experiments, we ask series of binary choice questions to the subjects in which subject faces the five treatments: i) no default nudge, ii) simple default nudge where one alternative is selected as default, iii) default nudge with ease where the questions are asked with many words so that the subject will find it easy to choose the default choice, iv) default nudge with endowment where the default choice is associated with endowment effect, and v) default nudge with endorsement where the default choice is associated with endorsement in the question. After understanding how these factors affect the default nudge, we employ an fMRI experiment to explore the neural basis of the emotional aspect of the mechanism of how these factors influence the effectiveness of the default nudge.
