abstract: "This pre-specified analysis plan describes the planned approach and main analyses of a nationwide stratified cluster-randomized trial of a Medicare value-based purchasing program for home health care. The Home Health Value-Based Purchasing program was designed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and implemented in January 2016. Randomization was conducted at the state level within nine regions. In the first year, 1,626 home health agencies from 9 states were assigned to the treatment group and 6,981 agencies from 41 states were assigned to the control group. This study will examine the effect of the intervention on health care quality in the first performance year (i.e., from January through December 2016)."
