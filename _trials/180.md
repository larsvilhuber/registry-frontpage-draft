abstract: "Despite the fact that 76% of females in Ghana have heard of at least one modern contraceptive method and 96% have heard of HIV/AIDS, this awareness has not translated into use of contraception.  Recent studies show that use of modern contraception among female adolescents is very low: only about one-third of sexually experienced female adolescents used a condom the first time they had sex.  The burden of sexually transmitted infections is high, with up to 20% of sexually active 15-19 year old girls reporting ever having symptoms. The Study on mhealth and Reproductive Health in Teens (SMART) is a randomized controlled trial that will evaluate the effectiveness of an interactive text-messaging program on improvement in reproductive health knowledge, communication, and attitudes among female adolescents in Accra, Ghana. Research will begin in January 2014 and conclude in June 2015."
