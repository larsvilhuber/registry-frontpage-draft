abstract: "The purpose of this study is to test new innovations in financial services aimed at helping vulnerable youth expand their saving and reduce their exposure to problem sports betting and gambling in Kenya and Uganda. Existing literature suggests that lottery linked savings accounts can increase peoples' savings while crowding out expenditures on negative return betting and gambling activities. This project aims to extend those insights by leveraging the other component contributing to the widespread popularity of sports betting across the globe: fun from predicting the outcomes of international football matches. Our lab-in-the-field experiment will allow for us to test the individual and joint effects of savings products that incorporate the potential for winning large (but low likelihood) prizes as well as the effects of fun in the form of gamification of this savings reward, built to resemble the structure of sports betting. In effect, this project will examine if savings products that leverage skewed rewards and a gamified experience increase savings and potentially crowd out other problematic sports betting behavior.
