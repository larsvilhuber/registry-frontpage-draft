abstract: "We conduct a series of field experiments to understand the behavior of passengers on public transportation. There are three research questions we are addressing. First, how do passengers estimate the probabilities of having incidents when the incidents are associated with others versus themselves? Second, what are the factors determining whether passengers choose to take the elevator or escalator at subway stations? Third, how do passengers decide which exit to take? Hundreds of subjects will be recruited for both experimental games and surveys. Information and other types of interventions will be implemented after collecting the data. Further analysis on the effectiveness of these interventions will be performed. "
