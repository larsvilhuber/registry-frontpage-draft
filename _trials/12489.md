abstract: "We are collaborating with a company that has integrated GPT into its internal office systems, allowing employees to directly engage with GPT through a dialog box in office software. However, the current usage rate of GPT among employees is relatively low. We plan to increase employee utilization of GPT through three pieces of information: information on the productivity gain of using GPT; the expectation management of GPT and the effective prompt techniques. Each employee will randomly receive one of these pieces of information or receive no information. We will observe the usage patterns of GPT for each employee before and after receiving the information, as well as their subsequent job performance."
