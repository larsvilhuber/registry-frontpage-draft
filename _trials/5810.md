abstract: "Many governments of developed countries encourage charitable giving through a favorable tax treatment. The efficacy of such policies eventually depends on whether donors are attentive towards these policies and what (mis)perception donors have. In the recent decade, the tax literature has demonstrated that consumers are inattentive to value-added taxes when they are not salient and that individuals have misperceptions concerning complex tax incentives. In many cases, it is likely that several biases are at play resulting in a gap in the perceived price and true price of tax incentives. The literature congregates these behavioral biases in the notion of the “behavioral wedge”. Considering the highly complex nature and low salience of the tax benefits for charitable giving, it is likely that donors misperceive the price of donating due to a multitude of biases. Yet, there is little evidence on the implications of these biases for donation decisions.  In this project, I study the “behavioral wedge” in donor’s decision making when it comes to tax incentives. Furthermore, I examine heterogeneity in biases, by scrutinizing whether this behavioral wedge varies income, tax filing behavior, donation  behavior and other background characteristics. To do so, I conduct a survey experiment with a representative German sample. To measure the behavioral wedge, I compare donation decisions in a “confusing” versus “clear” environment. In the “clear” environment biases are extenuated by providing information on tax benefits and making incentives salient, whereas in  the  control group respondents do not receive customized information prior to their donation decision. Additionally, to understand of which underlying biases the behavioral wedge comprises I will measure perceived tax benefits and appraise the effect of priming respondents to think about tax benefits without providing information on donation decisions."
