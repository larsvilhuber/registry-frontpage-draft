abstract: "We conducted an audit study where trained potential investors visited securities firms in China during both bearish and bullish stock market conditions. Across all market conditions, women were consistently given more conservative financial recommendations and were advised to allocate a smaller proportion of their investments to stocks compared to men. Additionally, during bearish periods, financial advisors offered female investors significantly higher commission discounts than male investors, whereas less significant differences in discounts were observed during bullish periods.
