abstract: "We investigate the impact of targeted subsidies and incentives for malaria rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) and treatment on demand, sales and stocking decisions, and patient health outcomes, using a novel digital platform in Kenya. This study investigates the impact of differentially targeted incentives for malaria rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) and appropriate malaria treatments on RDT uptake and medication targeting. We use a novel digital platform designed for use in a network of private pharmacies in Kenya. We cross-randomize patient subsidies and pharmacy performance incentives and compare their effectiveness to each other and to the status quo in a cluster-randomized control trial. Our findings will contribute to the literature on the use of subsidies, performance incentives, and digital technology on targeted treatments."
