abstract: "Does competition affect the impact of bribery on auction allocation and revenue? Bribery auctions are a collection of auction models where the auctioneer extracts a share of the seller revenue by soliciting bribes from potential bidders. This study aims to experimentally test this effect of competition in reducing the ineffeciency of bribery. To do this I introduce a two stage auction game. In the first stage the players can bid for the right of first refusal (ROFR) followed by an entry decision. Stage two is a standard first price auction (FPA) auction for the good with ROFR assigned to the winner of the first stage. I then vary the degree of competition in the first stage. This model is designed with experimental testing in mind, and thus has unique symmetric equilibria for any level of competition."
