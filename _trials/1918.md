abstract: "I investigate the impact of experimentation on performance in early-stage ventures, seeking to identify the venture-level and market-level conditions under which experimentation is most valuable. I propose a novel theoretical framework and test its implications via a field-based randomized controlled trial. The experimental work takes the form of an encouragement design.  "
