abstract: "Given the pervasiveness of insecure land tenure institutions around the developing world, and the role of historical institutions in shaping preferences and behavior, it is important to understand how the design of PES programs may interact with historical land tenure structures. In this project, we design a willingness to accept experiment, and a framed field experiment, across three regions of Uganda to answer the following questions: (1) What is the optimal timing of payments for an avoided deforestation PES program in Uganda?; (2) How do land tenure institutions impact the design of such a program; and (3) How does the security of land tenure impact deforestation behavior and trust in Uganda?
