abstract: "In this study, we aim to investigate the variations in willingness to pay for local and non-local potato chips among supermarket shoppers across different urban-rural landscapes, and the influence of different definitions of "local" on their purchasing decisions. We will conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment in Pennsylvania, focusing on supermarket shoppers in parking lots outside supermarkets situated in urban and rural areas. This approach will allow us to target supermarket shoppers and capture a diverse range of participants from various urban-rural landscapes."
