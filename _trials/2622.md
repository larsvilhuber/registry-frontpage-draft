Note that we participated in a Journal of Development Economics (JDE) pre-results review prior to endline data collection in 2019. That pre-results review constitutes our final pre-analysis plan, and supersedes information entered in this trail at the outset of 2018. Please see the attached plan for all pre-registration details."
