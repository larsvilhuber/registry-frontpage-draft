abstract: "We study the effect of an information treatment on the subjective beliefs of recent migrants from Afghanistan to Germany. In our sample, migrants overstate the probability to be deported and sent back to their home country by the authorities. We design a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to see the effect of this overstatement on migrants' beliefs of their ability to stay in Germany. We inform a treatment group of the past probability to be deported in the population. Then, we measure how migrants update their beliefs about the future rate of deportation in the population, their own chance to be deported, and the chance to stay in Germany, with or without a residence permit."
