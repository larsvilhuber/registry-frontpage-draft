abstract: "We present the pre-analysis plan for a randomized controlled trial in the Dominican Republic. The RCT evaluates the impact of several deterrence messages on wage misreporting (called "Payments Under the Table" or PUT from now on) and informality. This experiment is designed and implemented in joint work with the Dominican Republic Tax Authority (DGII). The rest of the document describes the randomization across different treatment arms, outcome variables, and expected results. We also pre-specify the heterogeneity analyses we expect to carry out as additional hypotheses."
