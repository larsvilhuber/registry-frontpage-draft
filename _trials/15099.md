abstract: "Financial incentives are known to motivate students to work harder, but their impact on intrinsic motivation remains uncertain. In this study, students were randomly assigned to a control group or one of two treatment groups. The first group (T1) used a time-management app with a voluntary check-in feature, while the second group (T2) used the same app but received financial rewards based on their check-in activity. The intervention included one pre-incentive week followed by two incentive weeks, during which the app recorded participants' activity. Prior to the incentive phase, students in the treatment groups were asked about their demand for a commitment device. When the access to students' academic outcomes are available, we will examine whether the time-management app (T1) helps students overcome self-control problems and whether financial incentives (T2) , as a form of extrinsic motivation, enhance this effort or undermine intrinsic motivation.
