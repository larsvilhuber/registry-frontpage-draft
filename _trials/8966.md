abstract: "Recent research in mechanism design has shown that simpler pricing strategies can closely approximate the profits obtained by more complex profit maximizing pricing mechanisms. But these simpler strategies are highly sensitive to the firm’s knowledge of the distribution of demand for each good. This has restricted empirical research on the topic to case studies and limited the application of these pricing strategies. The question remains, how well do simpler pricing strategies approximate the profit maximizing mechanism? We propose to use a lab experiment to determine how simpler pricing strategies perform when gaps exist in firm knowledge regarding the demand for goods and the correlation between consumers’ reservation values for goods."
