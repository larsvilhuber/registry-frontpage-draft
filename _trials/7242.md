abstract: "Importance of project: Creativity is economically important, but is typically one of many goals in a business environment. Given that producing creative output involves a financial cost, a crucial question facing firms is how direct incentives on creativity affect cost efficiency. 

Methods: I use a lab experiment where participants complete a task that can vary in two dimensions (creativity and cost efficiency), and face pay-for-performance incentives specific to one dimension only. The experiment uses a within-subject design (participants complete both the control and one treatment condition). I randomly assign participants to one of six treatments, which vary in the incentivised goal (creativity, cost efficiency, or a flat payment regardless of performance but double the time limit), and the per-unit bonus ('low' or 'high').

Outcomes evaluated: Creativity of final output, cost efficiency of final output, and cost effectiveness of each treatment condition relative to the control condition (units of creativity per dollar spent on each treatment group). "
