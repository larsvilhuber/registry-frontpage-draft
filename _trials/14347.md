abstract: "This study examines the use of adverse selection as a policy tool for taxing negative externalities through voluntary certification. Individuals or firms can choose to reveal their externality level and be taxed accordingly, rather than based on the average for non-certified parties. Parties with below-average externalities benefit from certification, and their choosing the individual taxation raises the tax for the non-certified parties. As the average tax for non-certified parties increases, more individuals are incentivized to opt for certification. Economic theory predicts that this process of separation will continue, and terms this phenomenon as unraveling. 
We apply this concept to heat consumption in Switzerland, where residential buildings often lack individual meters. Heating costs are typically allocated based on apartment size, but optional sub-metering could enable billing by actual usage. We test whether offering tenants the option of individual heat bills reduces opposition to sub-metering, even when the theoretical prediction of unraveling is explained.
