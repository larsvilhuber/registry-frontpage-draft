abstract: "Nationwide, there are 1.5 million elderly who are homebound and another 1.5 million who do not leave their home without assistance. These individuals self-reported fair or poor health at three times the rate of non-homebound seniors and report having chronic conditions and hospital stays in the past year at two and three times the rates respectively of non-homebound seniors. Because interventions involving primary care can be hard to access and may lack the adequate capacity, social services providing in-person and in-house support are increasingly needed. Five different agencies located in Detroit, MI, southern Georgia, South Dakota, Niagara, NY, and Birmingham, AL, all operate senior companion programs (SCPs) in various locations across the United States. SCPs partner a local homebound senior with a volunteer in the community who will conduct weekly visits with them, help with meal preparation or deliveries, provide transportation, assist with simple housekeeping, and socialize with the client amongst other tasks. These services are directed towards helping the senior client continue living independently in their own home instead of moving into an assisted living or nursing home. This program is being evaluated via a randomized controlled trial. Approximately 1040 senior clients split across the five agencies involved in the project will be randomized between treatment and control over two years. Researchers will assess the impact of receiving a senior companion on self-reported loneliness and life satisfaction as well as independent living status for the senior client.
