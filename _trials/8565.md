abstract: "We investigate attitudes towards inequality among the ``working rich" using a unique sample of nearly 1,000 graduates from a highly ranked MBA program and a representative sample of Americans. We show that (1) high-earning individuals are far more likely to know their rank in the income distribution and (2) a survey experiment reveals that comparisons with peers or others shape their redistributive preferences. This reference group treatment leads to an 18% drop in the income share allocated to the richest 1% but has no discernible effect on taxation preferences. We discuss the contribution of the comparative and normative functions of reference groups as potential mechanisms.
