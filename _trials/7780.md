abstract: "The municipality of Miraflores in Lima, Peru, has established a recycling programme, in which households can participate voluntarily and free of charge. Although households sign up to the programme voluntarily, few recycle regularly, pointing towards a gap between people’s intention to recycle and their actual recycling behaviour. Reminders can help people to follow through with their intentions by addressing the problem of limited attention. In this study, we conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test whether sms reminders can increase recycling behaviour of households. In particular, we will contrast the effect of continuous vs. interrupted vs. restarted reminders on households’ recycling behaviour. We will measure recycling behaviour of households over 12 weeks in total. While the first three weeks will serve as a baseline measure, the subsequent nine weeks will be our intervention period where households will be randomly assigned to either i) a control group that does not receive any reminders, ii) a group that receives continuous reminders over the whole nine weeks (continuous treatment), iii) a group that receives reminders only for the first three weeks (interrupted treatment), iv) or a group that receives reminders for the first three weeks and for the last three weeks, with a three weeks’ pause in between (restarted treatment). Our design will allow us to analyse the effects of continuous reminders on households’ recycling behaviour, persistence of reminder effects after the intervention has ended, as well as restart effects when the intervention is taken up again. We will further observe whether our intervention has positive spillover effects on the recycling behaviour of neighbouring households. "
