abstract: "While the digital revolution has greatly enhanced access to information for millions, it has simultaneously allowed unscrupulous state and non-state actors to spread misinformation online. Youth are particularly vulnerable to misinformation online or ‘fake news’.  Even though they are digital natives, recent research shows that a majority of them cannot distinguish between “sponsored content” and real news. A lack of ability to evaluate information and news online (digital literacy skills) among youth puts them at risk of being misled—this can have an adverse impact on the future of democracy worldwide. In light of this global threat, we explore strategies that improve digital literacy skills. Specifically we test the effectiveness of an educational program designed to improve digital literacy skills by conducting a large-scale randomized controlled trial with approximately 4,000 low and middle-income youth in India. The study will enable us to develop and evaluate tools that will help youth navigate information in the digital age and, in the process, strengthen democracy by ensuring that future voters can identify trustworthy information about social and political issues."
