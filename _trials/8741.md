abstract: "In October 2020, we asked firms for their highest and lowest potential expectations for PCE inflation in 2021. In this experiment, we wanted to test whether giving business decision makers information on the uncertainty (in the form of confidence intervals) around monetary policymakers’ projections influenced their inflation projections in October, and to see if this information impacted firms’ own unit cost expectations over the year ahead a month later in November 2020. To make sure that the information we were supplying was about the second moment only, we provided both the control and the treatment groups with the median expectation for PCE inflation over calendar year 2021 from the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections on September 15, 2020. For the treatment group we provided the 70 percent confidence interval around those projections based on the historical forecast errors of professionals (excerpted from the minutes of the September 2020 FOMC meeting)."
