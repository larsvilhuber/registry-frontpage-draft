abstract: "The impressive development of the Brazilian economy and the success of its government-run social programs, in particular those aimed at smallholder farmers, suggests that there is much to be learned from Brazilâ€™s experience. In particular, Brazilian-style programs, modified to function in new locations, could have a significant impact on the well-being of smallholder, family farmers in various African contexts. The goal of this project is to implement and evaluate a modified version of one such program, a transfer program for extremely poor farmers called Fomento. The ultimate goal of Fomento is to provide extremely poor family farmers with the support needed to lift them from subsistence level farming to some level of commercial production. 

This project will implement and evaluate a modified version of the Fomento program. Several different versions of the Fomento program will be tested to ultimately determine the most effective form of the program. This initial implementation and evaluation will be composed of two programs in two countries: Malawi and Senegal. The primary goal of this project is to test whether alleviating constraints facing small holder farmers can increase their production, and ultimately sell their production through commercial channels. Specifically, we will test two constraints: information and capital. Evaluations in both countries will examine and compare intensive agricultural extension and resource transfers intended for production."
