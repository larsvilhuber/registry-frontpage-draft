abstract: "This paper revisits the effect of ambiguity in strategic games first investigated by Kelsey and le Roux (2017). Once again we consider the impact of ambiguity in two strategic settings: the best-shot and weakest-link versions of public goods provision. We use the recent belief elicitation methodology proposed by Baillon et al. (2021) to elicit model-free ambiguity parameters of subjects' beliefs and ambiguity attitudes and investigate whether the type of strategic setting has an impact on decision-makers' ambiguity aversion (both absolute and relative) and their degree of a(mbiguity)-insensitivity."
