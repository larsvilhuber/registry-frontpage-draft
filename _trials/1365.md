abstract: "Consumers might choose to purchase certain products to show to others their own economic achievements and thus gain social status. We investigate how self-esteem influences the demand for social status: are self-esteem and social image complements or substitute? We consider premium credit cards, which can be demanded not only for the services and benefits that they provide, but also for social image motives. Since qualification requirements for these cards are usually high, this is a financial product generally available only to wealthy individuals. This exclusivity makes it a well-know symbol of success, which might enhance the owner's social image. We design a phone marketing experiment which has two purposes: first, to temporarily give a boost to the self-esteem of some customers; and second, to disentangle the role of social image considerations and instrumental benefits in explaining the demand for a platinum card."
