abstract: "The purpose of this research is to investigate how the provision of risk warnings and other information related to crypto assets impacts consumer knowledge and behaviour, particularly in terms of risk comprehension, perception, and the likelihood of recommending high-risk crypto assets to others. The trial aims to address the problem of understanding and mitigating risks in crypto investments. 

Research has shown that risk warnings can improve consumer comprehension and perception of risk in financial products (Delias et al. 2022). Additionally, the provision of past performance information is known to create expectations for future returns at similar levels, affecting consumer risk perception and recommendation behaviour (Weber et al. 2023). However, the specific impact of combining risk warnings with information about crypto returns and volatility on consumers' likelihood to recommend high-risk assets is less clear given a lack of existing studies on this issue.

This study hypothesizes that a combined information package of risk warnings, historical return data, and volatility information will significantly influence consumers' risk comprehension, perception, and recommendation behaviours. It also explores whether minor changes in the order of the information package can mitigate common biases among crypto investors, such as anchoring bias, disposition effect and overconfidence. These findings could inform policy regarding the presentation of risk warnings and financial information in the context of crypto investments."
