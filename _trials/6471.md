abstract: "Research on inequality aversion has been largely focused on the unequal distribution of monetary payment. However, inequality in naturally occurring environments can take many different forms. One important example of this is the unequal working load. In organizations, employees may receive the same salary but unequal working load. This project compares the attitudes towards inequality in these two domains. We will also address whether men and women may view these two types of inequality differently.
