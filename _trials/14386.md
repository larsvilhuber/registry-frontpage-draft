abstract: "This project seeks to understand job seekersâ€™ behavior when they anticipate ethnic discrimination in the labor market. In particular, we aim to understand whether anticipated ethnic discrimination deters job seekers from applying for jobs, whether they put less effort into job applications when they anticipate discrimination, and whether they sort into low-status, less competitive jobs. Our experiment entails advertising a job and observing the behavioral responses of the job seekers based on the anticipated ethnic discrimination."
