abstract: "High transaction costs may affect the quality of the interactions between citizens and the public sector leading to low trust in the government and low take up of services provided by the government. We study the effects of a proactive approach to public-service delivery on citizens trust in public institutions and access to government benefits. We partnered with Panama’s Tribunal Electoral (Electoral College) and developed an online app allowing citizens to renew their IDs online and avoid rather lengthy visits to the offices of the Tribunal Electoral. We then randomly vary the opportunity of using the application among citizens whose IDs are about to expire and compare the effect of access to the online application relative to a) the effect of simply receiving reminders and b) neither receiving reminders nor access to the application. The study will first use administrative data to quantify the effects of the interventions on the probability of renewing IDs on time. In a second stage, we will use survey data of a subsample of participants to quantify the effect of the intervention in time use, and trust in the implementing agency and other government institutions.
