abstract: "The study proposes a professional development intervention conducted by UNDP in collaboration with the government. The program aims at improving police behaviour and community relations in the Merged Areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The RCT focuses on training police officials in empathy, conflict resolution, and non-violent communication strategies to address public safety needs and enhance trust between law enforcement and communities. Through the use of instructional videos, in-person training, the intervention seeks to instill skills that foster respectful and effective policing, with the potential for scaling the approach across other regions. The main outcomes of interest are the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices of the police officers; Knowledge and Attitudes will be measured through an index based on a telephonic survey of the police officers, while the "Practices" will be measured through a "mystery shopper" observational approach.
