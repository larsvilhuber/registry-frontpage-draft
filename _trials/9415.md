abstract: "Payoffs that follow from collective action often depend on this collective action themselves, e.g., collective behavior induces climate change that, in its turn, affects the payoffs resulting from it. We experimentally study subjects’ cooperation behavior in the infinitely repeated prisoners’ dilemma with reinforcement. Using the model setup by Greif and Laitin (2004), we test whether positive feedback (cooperation increases future payoffs) leads to higher cooperation rates and negative feedback (cooperation decreases future payoffs) leads to lower cooperation rates as compared to neutral feedback. Furthermore, we differentiate between two cases: In the first round of the infinitely repeated prisoners’ dilemma, mutual cooperation is either a sub-game perfect equilibrium or not. "
