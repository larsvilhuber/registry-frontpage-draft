abstract: "Anxiety is a normal response that emerges from surgical operations and anesthesia, can affect the perioperative anesthetic management and overall surgical outcomes such as increasing anesthetic requirement, delayed awaking, postoperative pain, delaying in wound healing, impair immune system response, increased risk of infection, hypertension, dysrhythmias, nausea, vomiting, prolonged recovery period and hospitalization. The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of virtual reality on intraoperative anxiety and stress among Palestinian patients undergoing regional anesthesia. An experimental design known as randomized control trials (RCT) will be used in this study. The study will be conducted at Rafidia Surgical Hospital, a government hospital in Nablus City, West Bank, Palestine. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to two groups: immersive VR group and control-group. Tools for data collection will be used: The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and Visual Analog Scale (VAS)."
