abstract: "We study the causal effects of HIV education, home-based VCT, and conditional cash transfers (CCTs) for facility-based VCT on HIV/AIDS knowledge and the demand for HIV testing. Our study design involves three (overlapping) treatments and two rounds of experiments that randomly provide HIV testing and HIV/AIDS education. As shown in Figure 1, during the first round, three randomly selected treatment groups are offered three (overlapping) treatments: door-to-door HIV/AIDS education (Group 1), door-to-door HIV/AIDS education and home-based VCT (Group 2), and door-to-door HIV/AIDS education and CCT for facility-based VCT (Group 3). No treatment is offered to a fourth group of randomly selected households (control group). During the second round, half of the households in each of the four research groups from the first round are randomly assigned to a home-based VCT group, whereas the other half are assigned to a facility-based VCT group."
