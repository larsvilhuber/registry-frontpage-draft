abstract: "This paper analyzes the impact of decision-makers' heterogeneous perception of crime likelihood on their insurance decision. I assume that exogenous news about crime likelihood is digested differently for Republican and Democrat supporters, weighting information according to news source partisanship. Different probability weights result in distorted decision choices of suboptimal insurance deductibles. In addition, the paper tests if this notion can be corrected after the bias is explicitly revealed and if the correction would last."
