abstract: "Previous correspondence studies conducted in France and internationally conclude that there is on average no or little gender discrimination in the hiring process. These findings might however simply reflect the coexistence of positive and negative discrimination instead of revealing no discrimination. Discrimination in hiring may indeed be stronger or weaker against certain groups of women (e.g. age of having children) and in well-identified situations (e.g. for positions of responsibility). We thereby aim to answer to what extent gender diversity objectives effectively lead to taking into account the candidate's gender in recruitment decisions, but also under what conditions and for which types of occupations and application profiles this applies in particular. In that regard we disentangle two factors of heterogeneity which are likely to affect the interdependence between the objectives of diversity and non-discrimination: 1. firm characteristics (i.e. economic situation, level of diversity,etc), 2. candidate's characteristics (age, origin, etc), which we experimentally vary in fictitious applications."
