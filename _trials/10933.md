abstract: "Social media algorithms are an increasing part of our everyday lives, yet little is know about the causal effect of these algorithms on individual well-being. In this project, I study the effect of algorithms on consumer surplus and social welfare. This is done by disentangling the effects of user preferences for and attitudes towards different types of content, from the effects of algorithmic amplification of such content in a large-scale experiment, in cooperation with one of Indiaâ€™s largest social media platforms. I study the causal effect of these algorithms on user engagement with content on the platform, as well as on survey outcomes including users' subjective well-being, and willingness to pay for content customization via algorithms."
