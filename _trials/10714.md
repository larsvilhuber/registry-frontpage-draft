abstract: "As part of one CGIAR Market Intelligence and Product Profiling Initiative, the study focusses on providing behavioral intelligence to farmers for promoting new products, influence farmers for variety replacement and product substitution.  The project examines whether seed trial pack, and mechanical sowing interventions change farmer's adoption of improved variety and diversify their crops. We additionally examine if the technological (TD) and social distances (SD) act as barriers for crop choices and diversification.  An RCT on diversification is planned during winter season in Odisha, India for groundnut and green-gram. Green gram variety of Virat and Shikha; and Kaderi 66 and Dharni for groundnut will be used. The sample size for the trial packs will be 400 in case of green gram and 200 for groundnut. 0.5 acres of land size will be covered under the trial packs. The seed rate for green-gram is 10kg/acre and for groundnut is 75kg/acre. 


 The RCT will be implemented in five districts of Odisha, namely Barghar, Kalahandi, Mayurbhanj, Puri, and Ganjam."
