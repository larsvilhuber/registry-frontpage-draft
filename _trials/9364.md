abstract: "According to the most recent ICCP report, we have to immediately and rapidly reach net zero carbon emissions to avoid many of the worst effects.  Determining how to motivate the public to pursue carbon mitigation will therefore be essential for policy makers.  This project studies the willingness to pay (WTP), for climate change mitigation in an experimental setting.  In particular this project is interested if the way information about climate change is presented to people (framing), and people’s preferences on the distribution of income (social preferences), impact their WTP.  Further, this project also studies if an individual’s social preferences changes the impact of framing. 

The framing used in this experiment mirrors one of the real world characteristics of climate change. Developed nations pollute the most per capita, but developing nations are the most exposed to climate change.  Thus, some participants will receive framing emphasizing the risks from climate change to themselves directly, whereas others will receive language emphasizing the risk to those in developing nations.  It is hypothesized that the former framing may be more motivating to self-regarding individuals, whereas individuals who are more strongly concerned with other’s welfare will be more motivated by the latter framing.  Results from this experiment will become part of the literature seeking to inform active and ongoing policy discussions. For example, this project’s findings will be of use to policy makers trying to word a referendum. Environmental activists engaged in outreach such as deep conversation may also find the results helpful in tailoring their messages. Additionally, this project will help serve as a rare experimental check on what are typically hypothetical prices for carbon mitigation in WTP surveys.
