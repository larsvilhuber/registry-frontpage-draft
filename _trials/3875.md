abstract: "SMEs are a vital part of the economy of almost all Countries (including the UK). However, their contribution to wealth creation, GDP and employment is lower than expected since the share of high-productivity SMEs remains substantially low (especially in the UK). The UK Government has recognised that SME productivity is a concern and has worked since 2011 on an action plan to improve it. Recent evidence shows that a key barrier to SMEs development is the shortage of programmes that educate and support businesses. Other studies also suggest that the lack of systematic managerial approaches and evidence based decision-making also hinder the growth and productivity of SMEs. 
It is therefore important to ascertain what practices might improve SMEs’ decision-making processes - and, therefore, result in higher productivity. Addressing this research question would allow to better focus national and local government policies supporting SMEs, and more specifically to offer management training programs with proven ability to enhance small business owners and managers decision making. This project aims to address this question by testing the effect on SMEs’ productivity and growth of a set of novel business practices labelled ‘a scientific approach to decision making’. Extant studies converge in suggesting that SMEs, and especially microbusinesses, need to improve their ability to make rigorous strategic decisions. 
This suggests that there is considerable room for improvement in the way they are managed and that there is a clear need to have them learn effective decision making tools.
The project will focus on micro-businesses, which represent the lion share of all businesses in most Countries (including UK), but account for only a small fraction of turnover. This suggests that there is considerable room for improvement in the way they are managed. Moreover, identifying solutions to improve these firms’ productivity could lead to particularly impactful results and a substantial return on investment. A focus on micro-businesses is also consistent with our experimental research design, with the intervention targeted to business owners or managers whom, in microbusinesses make most decisions (and especially strategic ones) with direct impact on performance.
More specifically we want to know if firms adopting a scientific approach to decision making are more productive than non adopters. Using an experimental research design we will compare two samples of firms, similar -on average- on all covariates. We will intervene on the two groups offering management training and then test if the pre/post-intervention productivity increase of firms treated with the scientific approach is larger than the pre/post productivity increase in the control group (which gets standard management training).
