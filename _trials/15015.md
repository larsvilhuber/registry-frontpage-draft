abstract: "This study evaluates the effectiveness of social nudges in reducing no-show rates and promoting proactive cancellations among patients unable to attend their scheduled appointments. We plan to conduct a randomized controlled field experiment across three patient groups: a control group receiving standard appointment reminders and two treatment groups receiving tailored nudge messages designed to leverage social norms and encourage responsible behavior. The primary outcomes measured are the no-show and active cancellation rates across groups. Overall, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of social nudges in reducing clinic no-show rates and encouraging active cancellations."
