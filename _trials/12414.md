abstract: "We test for the role of quality certification on input choice. To this end we elicit the willigness to pay (WTP) for a bag of maize seeds in the presence and in the absence of a quality certification stamp on the seeds bag. Beliefs about seeds performance are also elicited at difference stages of the maize production cycle. Both beliefs and WTP elicitation are incentive compatible. Heterogeneous treatment effect (with respect to baseline farmer and farm characteristics) will be explored.  The RCT will entails a baseline, a midline and an endline. "
