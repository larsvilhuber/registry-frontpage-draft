abstract: "Physicians often face situations in which they must predict patients’ health outcomes under uncertainty. Existing decision tools are based on prediction models derived from clinical data, but typically include only a small set of known risk factors. In clinical practice, physicians often observe additional risk factors and patient characteristics which may improve their risk assessment. By performing an online experiment, we
explore a new risk assessment tool that allows physicians to combine their clinical experience and their assessment of a patient’s risk factors with the predictions of a decision tool in a structured way. In doing so, we aim to investigate the behavior of physicians in risk assessment and treatment selection."
