abstract: "We implemented a clustered randomized control trial with experimental auctions among 1,098 rural households in Malawi to evaluate whether providing training about food safety increased demand for safe groundnuts.  We tested if demand varied depending on if quality was observable or unobservable and if groundnuts were purchased at harvest or lean season. We found that the control group who was not trained valued observable quality only. At harvest, both trained and untrained consumers placed statistically equal premiums on unobservable quality. However, in the lean season, untrained consumers’ premium for unobservable quality disappeared, while trained consumers’ premium for unobservable quality increased."
