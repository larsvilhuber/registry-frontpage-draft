abstract: "Is an option especially tempting when it is both immediate and certain?  I test the effect of risk on the present-bias factor given quasi-hyperbolic discounting.  In my experiment, workers allocate about thirty to fifty minutes of real-effort tasks between two weeks.  I study dynamic consistency by comparing choices made two days in advance of the workday with choices made when work is imminent.  My novel design permits estimation of present bias using a decision with a consequence that is both immediate and certain.  I find greater present bias when the consequence is certain.  This finding has implications for any economic decision involving a present-biased decision-maker, including labor contracting and consumer good pricing.  Finally I offer a methodological remedy for experimental economists."
