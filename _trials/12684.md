abstract: "Catholic Charities of Northern Nevada (CCNN) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting families in need in the Diocese of Reno, Nevada. To support families in poverty, CCNN is launching Elevating Families, a holistic, case management program for parents with young children that is based on Economic Mobility Pathway’s (EMPath) Mobility Mentoring model. This program provides case management services meant to help families overcome short-term barriers and build income-generating capacity: these include holistic mentoring, incentives for accomplishing goals, free childcare, and classes on money management and career development. In order to quantify the effects of Elevating Families on key outcomes such as parental earnings, children’s school performance, and child protective services involvement, CCNN is partnering with the Wilson Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunity (LEO) to conduct a randomized controlled trial of the program. LEO is seeking to enroll 600 households to the study over a period of two years, with 300 in treatment and 300 in control. LEO will then track outcomes for study participants for two more years in order to determine long-run program effects."
