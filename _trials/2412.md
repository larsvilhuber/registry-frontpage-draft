abstract: "Federal loan forgiveness programs for teachers are an underutilized resource for recruiting and retaining teachers in high-need schools. Increasing awareness and participation in these programs can be an effective strategy to improve teacher quality in high-poverty public schools in Michigan. We intend to contact 11,000 teachers in Michigan with information about the Teacher Loan Forgiveness program (TLF) and their eligibility. We want to know if providing eligible teachers with clear, timely information about TLF and/or support in submitting applications will: (a) increase the fraction of eligible teachers who apply for and obtain TLF; and (b) increase teacher retention in high-needs public schools in Michigan."
