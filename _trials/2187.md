abstract: "From 2008 to 2012, Chris Blattman, Nathan Fiala, and Sebastian Martinez worked with the Government of Uganda (GoU), the World Bank, and the research non-profit Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) to study one of the countryâ€™s largest development programs: the Youth Opportunities Program (YOP). Under YOP, the government invited groups of roughly 20 underemployment young men and women to submit proposals for grants of roughly $8000, or $400 per person. This was one of the first randomized trials of a cash-based employment program in the world.

YOP turned out to be one of the most effective employment programs on record, at least among the ones with rigorous evidence. Blattman, Fiala, and Martinez (2014) document that most grant recipients invested the cash in skills and materials, started skilled enterprises, and four years later increased their earnings by almost 40%. Meanwhile Blattman, Emeriau, and Fiala (2017) provide evidence that beneficiaries increased opposition party membership, campaigning, and voting. 

This pre-analysis plan is for an nine year follow-up of all of the 2,675 original members of the original YOP study sample."
