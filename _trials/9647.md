abstract: "Context and general motivation: In 2018, there were 228 million cases of malaria and 405 000 malaria deaths worldwide (World Malaria Report 2019). The WHO African Region accounts for 93% of malaria cases and 94% of malaria deaths. Children under 5 years of age are the most vulnerable group affected by malaria; in 2018, they accounted for 67% of all malaria deaths worldwide (World Malaria Report 2019). Recently, the focus of prevention is to encourage households to adopt insecticide treated bed nets (ITN) over standard bed nets to increase the positive externalities of each use on the community. However, the benefits of ITN have been recently decreasing as mosquitos become more and more resistant, and bed net protects children and adults if they sleep under it but not during the entire period of time where the mosquito might bite. The World Health Organization therefore indicates in its global strategy for malaria that tools are needed for protection of people when they are outside of homes. Complementary tools include topical mosquito-repellent products.

Method: The impact evaluation will be carried out as a randomized controlled trial involving 3,120 sampled households and their children under five years old living in the rural, semi-urban and urban areas of Burkina Faso. Sampled households will be surveyed before and after the implementation of the intervention. Households will be offered to purchase mosquito-repellent ointment to protect against mosquito bites and then malaria. They will be randomly assigned to one of the three price groups. The main objective of the proposed project is to estimate the households’ willingness to pay for the mosquito-repellent ointment, examine how demand responds to a change in price, and evaluate the impact of using the ointment on households’ and particularly on children’s and mother’s health and wellbeing through a 4/6-month intervention. The panel dataset which will be available at the end of the study will significantly contribute to improving our understanding of the preventive behaviours related to malaria in Burkina Faso and will inform public health policies.

Method (extension): A follow-up will be conducted one year after the start of the intervention to observe current level of knowledge, behaviors regarding malaria, and malaria occurence among a subsample of initial households and among a random sample of neighbours. About 1500 additional households will be sampled in the extension. "
