abstract: "Individuals with criminal records often have low voting rates in states where they are legally eligible to participate in elections. Misinformation about eligibility, lack of knowledge, and lack of interest are all challenges to voting. Even though text messaging interventions to increase voting rates are commonplace among the general population (even if not very effective), it is unclear whether text messaging can address barriers to voting among system-impacted groups (i.e., individuals with records and those affected by the criminal legal system), who have unique needs and challenges to voting. 

Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we experimentally test whether and how text messaging can increase electoral participation. We leverage insights from adaptive text messaging interventions, which address variation in individuals’ responses to interventions by tailoring treatment to time-varying characteristics observed throughout the study. Using information about participants’ registration status, we adjust our interventions to tailor prospective messages accordingly.
