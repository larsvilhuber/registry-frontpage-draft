abstract: "We pre-register a pair-matched cluster-randomized field experiment involving last (eighth) year primary school students in Hungary. Randomization is done at the classroom level on data gathered in Spring 2018. We designed a non-economic information campaign. Our treatment is communicating otherwise unknown admission standards, and to encourage primary school students to apply to academic oriented high schools, the secondary grammar schools. Students in treated classrooms will receive the intervention while students in control classroom do not receive any treatment. Our primary outcome is the application of students to secondary grammar schools, measured by register data obtained from the Hungarian Educational Authority. We pre-register primary and secondary analyses. In the primary analysis we hypothesize that receiving the treatment about the admission standards will increase the likelihood of applying to grammar schools. In our secondary, exploratory, analysis we hypothesize that the intervention will have (1) larger benefit for those whose parents do not have high-school final examinations; (2) that it will have a greater influence on those who already intended to apply to secondary grammar schools; and (3) that it will have greater effect on those who originally intended to apply but believed that their own admission chances are weak. We submit the pre-registration plan before finishing the treatment. We are collecting baseline data about the students before the treatment in Fall 2018 from teachers’ reports and via students’ questionnaires. These data will be available in Spring 2019. Endline data will be available to researchers in Fall 2019. We pre-register to publish the results after a carrying out a similar intervention in Fall 2019 (so the data of two cohorts will be published). We also pre-register the possible circumstances under which we will not conduct the intervention the subsequent year, which means publishing the data of only one cohort."
