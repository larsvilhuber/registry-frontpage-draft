abstract: "This experiment examines the impact of policies aimed at promoting (legal) labor by reducing tax liabilities for taxpayers who earn up to certain thresholds (notches). For instance, marginal earnings thresholds exempt employees from social security contributions and taxes (e.g., in Austria, Germany, Switzerland). Value added tax (VAT) exemptions allow small businesses earning less than a certain limit to refrain from charging VAT. From a political perspective, such notches may be attractive if particular groups can be motivated to change their behavior (Slemrod, 2010). However, economists are traditionally skeptical of their benefit (e.g., Blinder & Rosen, 1984). Since the average tax rate discontinuously jumps when the cutoff is crossed, notches are associated with a region of strictly dominated choice above the cutoff; individuals can increase both consumption and leisure by moving down just below the cutoff (Kleven & Waseem, 2013). 

People can react to notches by adapting their labor supply (Kleven, 2016). Questions that remain open are whether the elimination of a tax notch has a different effect on labor adaptation than the introduction of a tax notch and to what extent reactions to a tax increase differ from a tax decrease. The study will be implemented as an online experiment. The advantage of an online experiment is that we can vary the type of tax notch and the direction of the tax reform in a controlled environment with a non-standard sample. Participants will be recruited using Amazon Mechanical Turk."
