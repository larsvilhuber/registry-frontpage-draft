abstract: "This pilot examines the impact of entrepreneurial training for students in Mexican high schools on earnings, employment, and socioemotional skills. The purpose of the pilot is to a) conduct a small qualitative/quantitative study comparing an entrepreneurial curriculum alone to an enhanced curriculum that focuses on growth mindset, b) understand the incentive structures that work to get normal secondary teachers engaged with the curriculum, and c) field test the survey and tracking protocols for a larger, properly-powered RCT to follow."
