abstract: "The experiment studies the effects of question order on the statistical relationship between two pieces of data that we collect through surveys: investorsâ€™ memory of past stock market experiences and future return expectations. We conduct these surveys among retail investors in China. Respondents are randomly assigned to one of three groups, each answering the same questions but in varying sequences."
