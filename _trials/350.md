abstract: "Electrification has long been a benchmark of development, yet almost 70% of the population of Sub-Saharan Africa lives without access to electricity. Since 2006, Kenya’s Rural Electrification Authority (REA) has rapidly expanded the national grid, installing electricity distribution lines and transformers across many of the country’s rural areas. There is now a unique opportunity to increase rural energy access through grid connections. This study explores the opportunity to increase rural energy access through grid connections. We utilize a randomized controlled trial to examine: 1) the demand for grid connections in rural areas, 2) the cost economies associated with mass connections, and 3) the social and economic impacts of grid power.
