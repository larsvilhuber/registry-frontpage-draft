abstract: "A growing literature in economics, psychology, philosophy and law considers how changes in the moral beliefs of members of the public influence the array of available products and services, the functioning of markets, and the regulatory environment that shapes society. That literature has largely focused on moral beliefs evolving toward greater acceptance of activities and transactions that were previously widely believed to be immoral, for example same-sex marriage or the availability of a market for human organs. In contrast, the progression of moral beliefs in the other direction, from widely accepted to broadly shunned, has received little attention. The implications of evolving views on morality can be large and important regardless of the direction in which the views are changing. We aim to undertake a program of research to study the role of moral attitudes in people becoming more averse to widely practiced activities and transactions, starting by looking specifically at the role of information rooted in morality in that evolution. 

We propose to conduct a series of experiments, some of which will test whether ethical information about an activity causes people to change their beliefs with respect to that activity, and others which will test whether information about an activity causes people to change their behaviour (i.e., likelihood to undertake or support that activity), and still others that examine whether various interventions rooted in behavioural economics cause people to change their beliefs and behavior. The specific case that we propose to consider in this first study is the consumption of a diet that includes animal products. We will explore the efficacy of "nudges" rooted in behavioral economics in shaping the attitudes and behaviors of study participants with respect to the consumption of animal products."
