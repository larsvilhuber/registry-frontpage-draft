abstract: "The last decade has witnessed a large increase in the perception of corruption in Latin America, and at the same time a decrease in preferences for democracy and trust. In a previous RCT,  "Rebuilding Trust, Social Cohesion and Democratic Values", (https://doi.org/10.1257/rct.7770-1.0.) we randomly assigned videos documenting politicians from different parties taking bribes in Mexico, among other treatments, to see whether the relationship between corruption and lack of trust in democracy is causal and how democratic values can be restored.  

One open question, however, is whether political corruption cumulates in its effects. In other words, whether, exposure to additional evidence of corruption has an effect relative to just one. In this RCT, we exploit new video evidence that came to light during our previous RCT to examine this question.  "
