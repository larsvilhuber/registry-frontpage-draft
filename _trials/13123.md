abstract: "Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is revolutionizing the workplace in ways we have never seen before. In a recent study, researchers show how GenAI could improve productivity of workers and quality of output in tasks that are within GenAI capabilities (Dell'Acqua, et al., 2023). In this study, we aim to explore a new facet of human - GenAI interaction, exploring the potential of using GenAI chatbots to upskill participants in a domain with which the participants are not familiar. We will use Data Science as the test case because this is within the domain of expertise of ChatGPT/GPT-4 with Code Interpreter, which will be the tool used in the experiment. Moreover, we seek to identify areas where GenAI might fall short in its ability to act as an effective coach and where participants using ChatGPT will be unable to substitute for data science domain knowledge and expertise.
