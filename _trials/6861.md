abstract: "We are interested in incentives and motivation for individuals and teams. We launch a large-scale online experiment to measure worker motivation across 20 treatments, contributing to literature on individual motivation and performance in real effort tasks and extending relevant findings to teams. We then run a prediction competition between lay experts (managers in US firms) and academic experts (researchers and professors at universities) in management and economics. Do intuitive managerial theories of what motivates team behavior align with worker performance in a real effort paradigm, and what can we learn about the role of team membership, what we call "team-based incentives," to increase the power of incentives with similar stake size relative to individual incentives? Our results are among the first to document the role of small but meaningful incentives for teams compared to individuals in a large-scale experiment. In addition to literature on incentives and gift exchange, we make a substantial contribution to literature on team behavior and framing effects in psychology and economics.
