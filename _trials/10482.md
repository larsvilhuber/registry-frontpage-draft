abstract: "The USAID/Mali Mission commissioned Results for Development (R4D) to conduct the impact evaluation of Keneya Sinsi Wale (KSW) and KN (Keneya Nieta) to measure the impact and sustainability of accountability, governance, and financing (AGF) interventions of KSW and KW at the ASACO and CSCOM level. The impact evaluation will address the following key question:

To what extent did investments in accountability, governance, and financing activities in Keneya Sinsi Wale and Keneya Nieta improve behaviors for health (including financing and governance behaviors) and use of services at community and health centers?

This evaluation will address whether improving local health systems leadership, governance, and accountability and reduced financial barriers to health services (KSW) and improving individuals, households and community financial management, planning and savings for health and increasing community engagement, ownership, and oversight of local health services (KN) will lead to a statistically significant improvement of key healthy behaviors and community financial management, planning and an increase of health savings behaviors for health at the village and household level.
