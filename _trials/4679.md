abstract: "In 2018, women remain underrepresented in senior management positions in key sectors such as the technology and financial investment sectors [Catalyst, 2018]. Although research has identified the impact of stereotypes on women’s and men’s decisions [Gorman, 2005; Coffman, 2014], it remains unclear how firms from these industries can develop an organizational design that helps reduce the strong and persistent impact of stereotypes on individual decisions such as knowledge contribution and persistence in the industry. 

This project examines through which mechanism gender group composition—the number of women in a group relative to the number of men—impacts the decision to contribute ideas to a group in the male-typed domain of financial and investment services. Building on insights from the literature on belonging uncertainty and stereotype inoculation [Walton, 2007; Cohen, 2008; Brands and Fernandez-Mateo, 2017; Dasgupta, 2015], I theorize that being in a female-majority group will reduce women’s belonging uncertainty and help foster women’s decision to contribute knowledge in the group. 

Recent findings by Chen and Houser [2017] highlight that gender group composition influences the impact of stereotypes on individuals’ knowledge contribution. Using the place-in-line game proposed by Coffman [2014] to measure the willingness to contribute, I will test whether the impact of gender group composition on the decision to contribute knowledge is mediated by a decrease in women's belonging uncertainty.
