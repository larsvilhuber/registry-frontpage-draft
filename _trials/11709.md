abstract: "In this paper, we study one channel through which communication may facilitate cooperative behavior. In a prisonerâ€™s dilemma experiment, we hypothesize that communication not only makes individuals more optimistic that their partner will cooperate but also increases the precision of this belief, thereby reducing strategic uncertainty. To disentangle the shift in mean beliefs from the increase in precision, we elicit beliefs and precision in an incentive-compatible two-stage procedure and in three situations: without communication, before communication, and after communication. Comparing mean beliefs without and before communication, we can estimate the mean shift. The comparison of the precision of this belief before and after communication provides our measure for a reduction of strategic uncertainty."
