abstract: "Can improving labor market opportunities for marginalized youth alter their social and economic trajectories? We examine this question in the context of Northern Nigeria, a region with a long history of religious tension and violence along Christian-Muslim lines. Using a RCT, we study whether providing skills training to impoverished youth, who largely lack access to formal education and attend Islamic religious schools, can improve their engagement in income generating activities and reduce their participation in religious and political violence. We also examine whether training can promote gender empowerment, both among trained girls as well as their caretakers.  The skills training is delivered through “Mafita”, a DfiD-funded initiative implemented by Adam Smith International (ASI). The training we examine in the impact evaluation described here takes the form of an apprenticeship, which provides on the job training in which youth train directly with skilled master craftsmen. The study involves 5,165 subjects and spans a two-year period, with endline data collected over the November 2018-May 2019 period. This document specifies the analysis plan for examining the effects of this training initiative, delineating the econometric specifications and outcomes we plan to examine, which, among others include:  employment, income, female empowerment, female confidence, participation in religious and political violence, religious extremism, social networks, and subjective wellbeing.
