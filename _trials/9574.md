abstract: "Undergraduate recruitment is a key channel for many firms to recruit workers for entry level jobs. However, the preferences of employers over job applicant characteristics have not been granularly studied. Moreover, little is known about students' perception about employer preferences, even though information asymmetries among job seekers may to contribute to disparities in labor market outcomes. This study aims to address these gaps in the literature using surveys and experiments on both employers and students participating in campus recruiting programs. Particularly, an Incentivized Resume Rating exercise (following Kessler, Low, Sullivan, 2019) will be conducted by employers to understand their preferences and their hiring heuristics. Job seeking students will also perform a similar exercise and also report their beliefs about employer preferences, which will help to expand our understanding of information asymmetries between the labor demand and supply sides, as well as the heterogeneity in the degree to which different types of job seekers understand employer preferences accurately.
