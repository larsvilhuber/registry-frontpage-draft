abstract: "School students are commonly exposed to traumatic and unforeseen tragic events which impact as many as 80% of the children worldwide. The reported prevalence rates of children's mental health problems in Pakistan are much higher (35%) than the global prevalence estimates of 10â€“20%. Considering the increasing prevalence of psychological disorders due to traumatic events among school students, this study proposes the implementation and adaptation of Listen Protect Connect (LPC) which is a school-based program of Psychological First Aid for primary and secondary school students. LPC program targets school students who have experienced any type of trauma. The distinguishing feature of this program is that it can be implemented by non-mental health professionals after they have received proper training from a mental health professional. The current study aims to translate and culturally adapt the LPC program and to carry out a feasibility evaluation of the program. Furthermore, this study will also evaluate the acceptability of the adapted version of the LPC program among schools in Pakistan by conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The proposed study will use a cluster, double-blind, parallel two arm trial design. A sample of 64 students will be chosen from 8 schools located in Rawalpindi and Islamabad districts (8 students from each school, 4 in each arm). The schools will be randomized into intervention and control arms (1:1 allocation in each arm). The program will be implemented to the students allocated in the intervention group through the teachers (non-mental health professionals) who will receive proper training prior to the implementation.  The teachers in the control arm will receive no training. The feasibility evaluation will demonstrate the significance of delivering the LPC program in schools in Pakistan. The primary outcome measures (exposure to trauma and psychological distress) will be evaluated through the Life Events Checklist (LEC) and Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6). Other scales will be used to assess the secondary outcomes of the study. The study results will demonstrate that embedding the LPC program within schools will be effective in fostering a continuum of improving the psychosocial health of students who are dealing with trauma in Pakistan.
