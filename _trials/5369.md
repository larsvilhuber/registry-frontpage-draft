abstract: "We study the role of exchanging private information in a noisy indefinitely repeated Prisoner's Dilemma with imperfect monitoring for cooperation in a laboratory experiment. The laboratory environment allows us to tightly control opportunities to communicate, whether signals are private or public, and the correlation structure of the signals. Controlling these factors  allows us to address the following research questions: 
	
What is the causal effect of the opportunity to report private information on the cooperation between participants? What is the role of the correlation structure for this effect? To what extend does the opportunity to report private information mitigate the problems associated with private monitoring? To what extend do experimental participants exploit the information contained in the correlation of signals?"
