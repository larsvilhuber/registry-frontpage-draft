abstract: "Using exogenous variation in culture (male-biased vs pro-female/egalitarian tribes), this project aims to analyze (i) the relevance of culture via heterogeneity in gendered beliefs for gender differences in outcomes, (ii) intergenerational transmission of beliefs, (iii) the role of cultural heterogeneity in assortative mating, and (iv) the role of cultural heterogeneity in political participation.
