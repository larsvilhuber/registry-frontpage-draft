abstract: "Large treatment gaps in mental health services exist, and to address the gap promising psychotherapy interventions delivered by non-specialists have been created and tested. However, questions remain as to how to scale-up these psychotherapy interventions, and in particular whether scaling-up through existing government health structures leads to similar results compared to non-governmental agencies. Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in rural Ethiopia, this study will assess the effectiveness of a low-cost psychotherapy intervention, group Problem Management plus (gPM+), delivered in separate arms by stipended local facilitators (LFs) engaged by a non-govermental organization, or government-employed health extension workers (HEWs). The study will be evaluated through a baseline, one-month and 12 month follow-up surveys.  Primary outcomes include mental health (depression, stress, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress) and child development measured at one month and 12 months post- program, as well as a range of secondary outcomes including economic outcomes (labor, savings, and food security), behavioral outcomes (alcohol abuse and intimate partner violence), cognitive and non-cognitive skills (General Self-Efficacy and forward digit span), social support, and childcare practices. In addition, to better understand mechanisms for any differential effects across delivery platforms, we will collect detailed data on knowledge, attitudes, and productivity of both HEWs and LFs. "
