abstract: "We designed a digital educational intervention to improve money management practices and financial well-being among college students, where we delivered weekly nudges for three months via mobile phone and email to review and complete activities from the online platform CashCourse. We evaluated our intervention using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and the outcome variables of interest are the financial self-efficacy scale (FSES) and financial health score (FHS).
