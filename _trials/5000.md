abstract: "Numerous studies have shown that providing incentives can encourage abstinence from drugs in drug-treatment settings. Despite evidence that incentives are effective and the increasing need for effective approaches to combat the addiction crisis, incentive programs have not been widely implemented. A key barrier is that while the benefits are largely borne by patients and taxpayers, there are large logistical costs that must be borne by clinics. We propose to conduct the first randomized evaluation of an innovative, scalable incentives program for opioid addiction delivered through a mobile application. The efficacy of this approach has not been tested rigorously before."
