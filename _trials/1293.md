abstract: "This paper presents the pre-analysis plan of a randomized intervention providing free legal representation to a treatment group of small scale farmers in a rural community of Kenya. Our hypothesis is that legal representation will increase access to the judiciary, the security of property rights, investment, agricultural production, and thus decrease poverty."
