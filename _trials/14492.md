abstract: "Climate change has proved to be one of the most important and salient challenges of our times. While informed and effective policies are essential to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change, attitudes towards climate change and preferences over climate mitigation policies in America are highly varied  (Leiserowitz et al., 2019)  and  among the most politically polarized, making it highly challenging to develop support for bold, broad and bipartisan initiatives needed to address its challenges. Understanding which policy levers can be effective in reaching individuals, helping them to learn and overcome existing barriers that hinder support and action on climate change policies is thus vital.
