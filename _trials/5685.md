abstract: "We present a survey study that explores two experimental analysis: first, a cross-country norms effect on petition signing, and second, a cross-state comparison, focusing on clean energy adaptation instead of fossil fuel energy. In the first study, we use energy consumption information from the US, EU, and China. Using the first study, we redesigned the second experiment by providing energy utilization in Arizona and New Mexico to validate our norms. The results reveal that the attendants are more likely to sign a petition—by seven percent—in favor of clean energy act when they have been provided with additional information. "
