abstract: "Distributive justice principles are commonly used in societal debates to support policy positions and argue for their legitimacy. Prominent formal incarnations of such principles are the Rawlsian, Utilitarian, Efficient transfer (e.g. Pigou-Dalton), and Leaky-bucket transfer (e.g. Hammond) principles, but could also be formulated by the minimization of the Gini coefficient, for instance. Individual preferences over such principles may arguably depend on individuals’ understanding of their application. In an incentivized task, we observe heterogeneity in individuals’ abilities to apply distributive justice principles to specific income distribution scenarios. We systematically test whether exposure to applying these principles, with and without feedback, changes preferences over principles. We compare responses in a student sample to a sample representative of the general population in the UK. Our findings may have important implications for the elicitation of preferences over distributive justice principles."
