abstract: "There is substantial variation across developing country surveys in labor market measurement. Different surveys use different recall periods, definitions of employment and search, and levels of detail in prompts. This variation may reflect open questions about how best to collect labor market data in these settings. We conduct a series of survey methods experiments in the context of a large panel study in Lahore, Pakistan. We will use these experiments to understand how variations in survey timing, recall periods, and questionnaire design influence measures of job search and employment.  We benchmark the survey data against administrative data via a job search platform."
