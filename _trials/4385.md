abstract: "To incentivize employee performance, many companies employ performance appraisals that are tied to compensation. In such ratings, employees are typically evaluated on a specific predetermined scale. It is often observed that the lowest rating categories are unused resulting in compressed appraisals. So far, research on subjective evaluations often associated this behavior with rating bias. In this project however, we study the question whether compressed appraisals may be designed by companies intentionally adding unused lower categories in order to frame rating scales to avoid negatively reciprocal reactions of employees."
