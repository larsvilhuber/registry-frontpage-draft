abstract: " Almost 10 percent of young adults in Norway are “Not in Education, Employment or Training” (NEET) (OECD 2018). In order to improve their current situation, these youth need to show self-discipline and work towards their goals, whether this goal is to enter the labor market or achieve education. We have developed an app (RØST) which is based on protocols from psychology and supports applicants for work or education. We will investigate if this app is effective in helping youth who are currently unemployed and not in school to take steps to achieve their goals."
