abstract: "This is a follow-up on two experiments (2011, 2012) conducted to study the flood tolerant rice Swarna Sub-1. In both experiments, farmers in treatment villages were randomly selected to receive 5kg minikits of Swarna Sub-1 seeds. The study attempts to determine the long-run impact of the technology on farmersâ€™ cultivation practices, household investment, welfare and on the local economy. (The original study is registered as AEARCTR-0000448.)"
