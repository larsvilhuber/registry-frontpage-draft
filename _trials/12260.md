abstract: "The changing skills requirements of the labour market pose a potential threat to the employability of the workforce. A large body of literature shows that training can reduce the risk of unemployment by improving and updating individuals' skills. This is particularly relevant for low-skilled flexible workers, who are often less motivated to participate in training and face relatively lower job security. While previous research has examined the impact of labour market information interventions on individual behaviour and labour market outcomes, such as job search behaviour, there remains a lack of evidence on the impact of labour market information on training behaviour. To fill this research gap, this study presents a field experiment, designed in collaboration with a prominent Dutch employment agency, to investigate the influence of labour market information and it's framing on the (re)training behaviour of low-skilled flexible workers."
