abstract: "This randomized controlled trial is part of a three-year program that aims to increase take-up and productivity of pulse cultivation in five districts of Northern Bihar, India, through four local implementing partners. This project has established a Farmer Producer Company (FPC) in each of the five districts to connect local farmers to input and output markets. The FPCs will market crops for the first time in the 2019 Kharif planting season, when they will focus their marketing efforts on black gram. This study evaluates the effect of two different types of price supports, designed to mimic possible statewide pricing policies, on farmers' willingness to produce and market black gram."
