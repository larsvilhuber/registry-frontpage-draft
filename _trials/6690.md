abstract: "Consumers in the United States are being exposed to unprecedented high levels of pharmaceutical direct-to-consumer-advertising (DTCA), with $5.63 billion spent in 2015. Prior work has identified associations between DTCA and rising prescription drug utilization using observational data, but the causal impact of DTCA is unclear. In order to concretely identify and estimate the effects of DTCA, we design a randomized experiment to examine the effects of DTCA on the use of drugs, health related behaviors, and information seeking behaviors, as well as the effects of price disclosure on behavioral intentions and consumer behavior."
