abstract: "Before the rise of covid-19, the US was already in the midst of health crises, which are largely suggestive of worsening mental health. Case and Deaton (2015, 2017) address the worsening mortality rates for segments of the US population, which seem to be driven by ``deaths of despair,'' caused by opioids, alcohol, or suicide. Unfortunately, under half of mentally ill people in the US typically get the treatment they need (National Institute of Mental Health, 2019). I consider a pandemic-appropriate strategy for improving wellbeing by broadening access to proven app-based mental health treatment (Firth et al., 2017a,b). Following Torous and Roberts (2017), I hypothesize that lack of clear information about data privacy distorts the market for mental health apps. I propose and test a simple five-star privacy-policy rating system as a possible solution to this problem. "
