abstract: "What messages work best to encourage political participation among un-represented and low-participating groups in developing democracies? This study examines the impact of providing young, urban South Africans who are not registered to vote with different types of motivational messages encouraging them to register and vote. Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we test whether providing a carefully piloted, clearly expressed motivation for why citizens should vote, delivered face-to-face, will improve registration and voting."
