abstract: "Excessive absenteeism in the workplace may affect workers’ productivity, firm’s financial output as well as team cohesion and perceived fairness. Yet, causal evidence on the effectiveness of potential instruments to reduce employee absence is scarce. We conduct a field experiment (RCT) in collaboration with a large German retail chain to investigate the effectiveness of two incentive schemes, randomly assigned among the firm’s apprentices. In particular, apprentices collect points throughout the year earning one point for each month without a single day of absence. At the end of the year, points are converted into a reward according to the randomly assigned treatment condition. One group of apprentices receives a monetary reward; another group receives a reward in the form of additional vacation days. The remaining apprentices serve as the control group. Treatments are designed to reduce those absence spells that are not due to genuine sickness, but are a form of shirking behaviour. The novelty of the time-off reward lies in the fact that it is in the same domain as the primary outcome. Therefore, it is less likely to backfire into excessive presenteeism. Along with a rich set of employee characteristics, we are able to observe the apprentices' daily attendance prior to, during and after the invention. We complement this dataset with two comprehensive surveys to investigate changes in the apprentices’ perception and to identify the corresponding mechanisms. "
