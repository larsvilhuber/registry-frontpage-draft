abstract: "In many countries, carbon pricing policies have not been implemented to an extent advocated by economists, partly due to fear of consumer and voter backlash. In this study, we conduct an online survey experiment to investigate determinants of support for (or opposition to) carbon pricing policies in the United States. Furthermore, we provide information through video interventions and investigate whether this can increase policy support. In particular, we focus on the roles of perceived social norms about climate action as well as reasoning about the economic mechanisms and impacts of carbon pricing. The use of different video interventions helps us shed light on several questions. Does policy support respond more strongly to norm-based appeals or to the perceived merit of a policy? Is there heterogeneity in which people are influenced more strongly by which type of information? Can norm-based interventions make individuals more receptive to information about the merits of a policy?"
