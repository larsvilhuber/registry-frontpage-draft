abstract: "How should policymakers disseminate information: by broadcasting or letting word spread from a small number of “seeds”? While conventional wisdom suggests broadcasting is better, we show theoretically and experimentally that this may not hold when people need to ask questions to fully comprehend the information. During the 2016 Indian demonetization, we varied how official policy information was delivered on two dimensions: how many were initially informed and whether it was disclosed publicly who was initially informed. Our results are consistent with the model: when who is informed is commonly known, telling more individuals leads to fewer conversations and inferior knowledge."
