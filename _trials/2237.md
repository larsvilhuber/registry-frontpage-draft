abstract: "School drop outs and grade repetition are important problems in Catalonia, being significally higher than in the rest of the EU. The existing evidence suggests that programs that involve families in students' education are more likely to have positive impacts. On another note, the nudge thoery tells us that positive reinforcement and indirect suggestions can produce important changes in people's behavior. 

A nudge was introduced in the Èxit Estiu program, which offers free teaching during summer to pupils that have to retake exams. The nudge consists of sending SMS messages to parents, encoraging them to become more involved in their childrens' education. The Catalan Institute of Public Policy Evaluation (Ivàlua) used a randomized evaluation to test wether this low intense intervention would increase the number of successful subject passes in the retake exams of September 2015. Families were randomized into receiving informative text messages, receiving sensitizing text messages or not receiving any text messages.
