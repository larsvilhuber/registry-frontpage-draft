abstract: "We will partner with a cotton outgrown farming company in Zambia to test a program that allows farmers to take an advance on their harvest earnings during the lean season. We will measure impacts on company profits, on recipient labor allocation and income, and on spillovers to ineligible households via prices and wages. The study is designed to test the scaling potential of findings from Fink et al. (2018) and investigate the general equilibrium effects of lowering lean season interest rates for selected households in a labor market."
