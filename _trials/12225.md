abstract: "Commercial agglomeration is observed in many parts of the world. There are several theoretical explanations as to why commercial clusters occur, but empirical research is limited. This study attempts to examine the mechanisms of commercial agglomeration by surveying wholesalers located in one of the major wholesale markets in an emerging Asian country. When the market was destroyed by a fire in 1994 and rebuilt in 1997, about 1,400 slots were randomly assigned to garment wholesalers by a lottery. By collecting historical data over the past 25 years, we will analyze how the initial random allocation was transformed into the clustering of product types observed today. By taking advantage of the setting where a large number of similar-sized firms in the same industry operate, we conduct a survey experiment by randomly assigning enumerators to each sample firm to quantify the enumerator effect in a firm survey.
