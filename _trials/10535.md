abstract: "We estimate demand for redistribution by a stratified sample of US citizens selected from the bottom and top 20% of the US income distribution. Participants decide how much money to redistribute from an entrepreneur earning more than $100,000 in real life (labelled Person 1), to an individual earning less than $10,000 in real life (labelled Person 2). Person 1 is initially assigned $50 in this interaction upon completion of a task, while Person 2 is assigned $1. Using conjoint analysis, the real-life characteristics of sixteen Person 1s and four Person 2s are used to investigate the relevance of both the willingness to reward individual merit and the beliefs in trickle-down economics in accounting for participants’ preferences for redistribution. Participants are administered 16 different redistributive choices matching eight different profiles for Person 1 and two different profiles for Person 2. We manipulate (a) the number of hours worked (a measure of merit for both Person 1 and 2); (b) Whether Person 1 founded or inherited their firm (a measure of merit for the entrepreneur); (c) The number of employees in Person 1’s firm; and (d) The amount donated by Person 1 within a year (c and d being measures of the trickle-down potential of the rich choices). In a follow-up wave, we also manipulate (e) The amount of patents obtained by Person 1’s firm in the last year. One randomly selected decision is actually implemented. To check for external validity, in the second wawe of the study we add a choice on how much money to donate to a charity supporting poor people in the US. "
