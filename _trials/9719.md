abstract: "Fairness perceptions are important in shaping redistributive preferences , as well as support for taxing the rich. Evidence from laboratory experiments finds that demand for redistribution is higher when the better off are seen to have gained their incomes through luck rather than effort. This luck vs. effort distinction misses something important, however, as most real-world distributive decisions are between incomes earned through different types of work. In this study, we provide a first experimental test of whether fairness views and preferences for taxing top earners differ when their income is earned through luck, routine work, or (non-routine) complex work. This set up also mirrors the changing nature of tasks in the US labour market in recent decades as a result of routine-biased technological change, which has seen a substantial shift towards the type of abstract problem-solving tasks that are complementary to information and communications technologies. In three novel incentivised belief elicitations, we also test the underlying causes for the differences in perceived deservingness of top incomes across treatments. Specifically, we test whether such differences are due to a change in perceived cognitive cost, agency, or uniqueness of the required skills across tasks of varying complexity."
