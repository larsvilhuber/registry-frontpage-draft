abstract: "In this trial, we study the impacts of study group gender composition on various outcomes of students in higher education. In particular, we study the role of gender in developing sexual health literacy, and how various aspects are affected by peers in the context of sex education. We choose a popular course in sexual health literacy in a Chinese university in which more than 640 students are registered at the beginning of the semester, and then randomly assign students into study groups that vary in gender composition: 1) fully male, 2) fully female, and 3) half male and half female. Students are surveyed both before the group assignment (at baseline) and at the end of the semester (at endline). We focus on students' learning outcomes by incorporating multiple-choice knowledge tests. In addition, we measure students' personality, health communications, marriage and fertility preferences, and several social opinions."
