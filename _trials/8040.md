abstract: "The goal of this study is to estimate the causal impact of reducing the share of income that housing voucher recipients must pay towards rent on outcomes including labor supply and financial wellbeing. The investigators will collect data from housing voucher recertifications, credit reporting agencies, and an annual participant survey covering physical, mental, and financial wellbeing and employment and earnings.  Outcomes will be collected for 180 control and 100 treatment households. The investigators will compare these outcomes for those who did and did not receive a reduction in their required rent payments."
