abstract: "Investors have been found to attribute an excessive role to more recent return realizations when making predictions, even though at low to medium horizons stock returns exhibit little autocorrelation. This tendency is known as “extrapolation bias.” Using an online survey, we test whether team interaction mitigates or amplifies such a bias."
