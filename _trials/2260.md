abstract: "This laboratory experiment is aimed at evaluating the effects of social reference points on effort provision.
In the context of our study, social reference points are understood as peers with which individuals compare themselves.
Broadly speaking, our experiment is aimed at better understanding a) whether exogenously assigned social reference points affect performance, b) whether endogenously chosen social reference points affect performance differently than exogenously assigned social reference points, and c) how people choose their social reference points. We also plan to study heterogeneity in treatment effects along several interesting dimensions."
