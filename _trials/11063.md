abstract: "Many firms offer extra bonus to motivate their workers. Some bonus schemes reward the workers by their absolute performance or share of contribution, while others reward the workers outperforming their peers. The structure of bonus schemes affects the incentives the workers face and thus their performance, however, it will also determine the distribution of their incomes, which may or may not be perceived as fair. It is intuitive to think that a bonus scheme creating a larger income gap between the high- and low-performers may bring greater overall output, but at the same time unfair to the low-performers if the output gap is sufficiently small. A rank-order tournament, for example, has been shown to outperform other types of bonus schemes in eliciting the workers’ performance (Lazear & Rosen, 1981). On the other hand, it may be seen as unfair since its win-or-lose structure generates unequal incomes unproportional to the workers’ input (Cappelen, Falch & Tungodden, 2020;Cappelen, Sorensen & Tungodden, 2007; Konow, 2000). 

Managers sometimes need to make decisions in which they have to trade off expected output growth and fairness. Their decisions could differ since they might hold different beliefs about the incentive effect and different fairness views. Moreover, the relative weight they put on efficiency and fairness could also depend on how they themselves are paid. How do people perceive tournament incentives? How do people decide whether or not to incentivize others with tournament bonus?

In this project, I plan to conduct an online experiment to collect data on subjects' beliefs about the output difference under a flat vs. a tournament bonus incentive, their views on the fairness difference of these two bonus schemes, and their choices of bonus schemes for two other workers. In addition, I also plan to investigate whether subjects' perceptions and decisions vary with different gender composition of the worker group. This pre-analysis plan presents the data sources, the experimental design, and the empirical strategy of the project."
