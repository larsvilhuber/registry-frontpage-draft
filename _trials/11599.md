abstract: "Personal connections are an important search and matching channel across different labor markets, formal and informal, in both high- and low-income settings (Topa, 2011; Burks et al., 2015). Despite improving matching efficiency, the system of employee referral risks penalizing minority groups and reinforcing labor market segregation. In informal labor markets, where job network is key for landing a job through referrals, biases among employees, and not only firm owners or HR departments, act as an additional barrier to gender equality in access to certain occupations (Beaman et al., 2018). Employees tend to refer network members with similar characteristics, including gender (Brown et al., 2016). In particular, women are less likely to use informal contacts than men, their contacts tend to be more clustered in certain occupations, and, for them, similar levels of network usage yield lower wages and promotion chances than for men (Topa, 2011). This project is an extension of a previously registered project (AEARCTR-0008036) to examine the extent of gender bias perpetuated by employees through the referral system. As in the original project, we present employees of businesses operating in highly segregated occupations with profiles of potential candidates to investigate their gender preferences as well as how these preferences interplay with personal connection to the candidate. Also here, we also assess whether information shocks and changes in confidentiality can change the referring preferences of employees over candidates. In this project, we correct some shortfalls of the previous one: (1) we have 4 main treatment arms rather than 2, (2) we improve the framing of the confidentiality, (3) we introduce vignette experiments to understand the mechanisms, and (4) we improve the construction of the profiles shown to respondents."
