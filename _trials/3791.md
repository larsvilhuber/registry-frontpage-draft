abstract: "Background: Many HIV-positive patients do not adhere to their antiretroviral medication (ART). This leads to higher viral loads and greater probability of transmission. Present bias—a tendency to give in to short-term temptations at the expense of long-term outcomes—is a potential driver of low adherence. In this study we test a novel intervention rooted in behavioral economics that is designed to overcome present bias and increase ART adherence.   

Methods/Design: We will enroll 400 HIV-positive patients (330 core sample, and 70 additional as described below) at Mildmay hospital in Kampala, Uganda in a two-year randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomized to one of three groups. The first intervention group (T1, n=110) will be eligible for small lottery prizes based on timely clinic visits and demonstration of viral suppression. Group 2 (T2, n=110) will be eligible for the same lottery prizes conditional on high electronically measured adherence as captured by a medication event management system (MEMS)-cap. The control group (n=110) will receive the usual standard of care. In addition, 70 treatment initiators (those who started treatment within the last three months) will also be recruited and assigned to T2. Adherence will be measured continuously throughout the study and for 12 months post-intervention to evaluate effect persistence, surveys will be conducted at baseline and then every six months, and viral loads will be measured annually. Primary outcomes are undetectable viral load and MEMS-measured adherence. Secondary outcomes are log transformed viral load as a continuous measure and a binary measure for whether the person adhered to greater than 90 percent of their ART pills. 

Discussion: Our study is one of the first to investigate the effectiveness of lottery incentives for improving ART adherence, and in addition compares the relative efficacy of using measured adherence versus timely clinic visits and suppressed viral load to determine lottery eligibility. MEMS-caps are relatively costly, whereas viral load testing is now part of routine clinical care in Uganda. BEST will test whether directly incentivizing timely clinic visits and viral suppression (which canbe implemented using readily available clinic data) is as effective as incentivizing electronically measured adherence. Cost-effectiveness analyses of the two implementation modes will also be performed."
