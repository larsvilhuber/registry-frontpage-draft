abstract: "This study examines whether psychic costs reduce the vaccination take-up for tetanus-toxoid vaccine among women in northeastern Nigeria.  To measure psychic costs, we asked women in the control group to simply complete a short survey. For the treatment group, we asked women to additionally receive the tetanus-toxoid vaccine. We evaluate the rate of task completion (survey completion vs. survey completion + vaccination) to measure the magnitude of psychic costs. Randomization was done at the individual level among 800 women in 41 villages. "
