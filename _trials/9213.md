abstract: "Health agencies are responsible for informing the public about (potential) disease outbreaks. If many individuals follow the recommendations of an agency and take preventive measures in case a health risk is identified, the number of actual cases of harm may be low, even if the estimated health risk was high. The literature suggests that individuals who have experienced such a ``non-event'' may question, in hindsight, whether the risk was really as high as communicated and whether (costly) preventive measures were reasonable. Using an online-experiment, we investigate whether the experience of non-events causes participants to perceive a communicating agency as less reliable and to take more risks the next time a risk is communicated, resulting in a less efficient outcome for society. In a repeated task, participants receive information each period about whether their group is in a low- or high-risk scenario from a communication source, and then must decide whether to choose a safe option or invest in a lottery. A non-event occurs if a high-risk scenario was communicated but the actual number of participants who lost the lottery is low. We find that non-events decrease group efficiency in particular if an uninvolved bystander questions the communicated information after a non-event has occurred. Aside from this, communication generally leads to higher efficiency than no communication."
