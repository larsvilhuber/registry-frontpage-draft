abstract: "Privacy in the issuance of a central bank digital currency(CBDC) is an important and controversial issue. In this study, we aim to understand how much people care about privacy in the acceptance of CBDC through an information provision experiment. Different statements will focus on the privacy issue of CBDC by highlighting the degree of anonymity. Further, we will investigate privacy attitudes, behaviors and current payment method usage behavior to see how it relates to CBDC acceptability. Our sample will consist of 3,400 representative Koreans.
