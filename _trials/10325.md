abstract: "There have been increasing dislike and distrust between Republicans and Democrats in the US in recent years. Such affective polarization can be explained by social identity theory, but we know little about whether its underlying mechanism is preference-based and belief-based. This study presents an experiment to distinguish between the two mechanisms of affective polarization, where we use an encouragement design to increase people's political participation shortly before the 2022 midterm election, in order to increase their political identity salience. We assume that the increasing political identity salience will cause people to display more affective polarization. By observing how people's preferences and beliefs change due to the salience increase, we will be able to identify the underlying mechanism of affective polarization."
