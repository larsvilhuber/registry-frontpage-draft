abstract: "In this study, we conduct a field experiment examining the formation of personal social networks. Using fictitious social media profiles on the social networking site Instagram that show photos signaling high (low) conscientiousness and agreeableness/neuroticism, respectively â€“ which are key dimensions of the Big Five personality traits relevant to selection decisions, we study the effect of these personality traits on the acceptance rate of friend or follower requests. The social media profiles are based on previous research (AEARCTR-0012473) that conducted several randomized online pilot experiments to verify that the visual clues posted on the profiles accurately represent the intended personality dimensions, while ensuring authenticity. In this experiment, we gather suggestions for friends or contacts to follow, leveraging a common feature of social networking platforms for receiving friend suggestions. Subsequently, we send friend or follower requests to these users and measure the rate of acceptance, as well as whether users re-follow the fictitious profile to shed light on the nuanced dynamics of personal social network formation and the role of personality traits therein."
