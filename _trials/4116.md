abstract: "We introduce and test an early learning intervention on child-directed speech in the Solomon Islands and East Timor, which aims to: (i) estimate the relative contributions of parental inputs in the child human capital production function, and (ii) identify the channels through which early childhood interventions can be effective. We provide parents with information and learning materials intended to stimulate child-directed speech. We then measure short-run (within days of the intervention) and medium-run (after 1 year) effects of the intervention on speech outcomes."
