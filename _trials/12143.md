abstract: "While female share in the global labor market is increasing, their participation still lags behind that of men in most countries and they represent most of the low paying occupations. One of the important determinants of individualsâ€™ educational investments and occupational choice is considered their aspiration levels. 
In this research project I plan to study if aspiration of school aged children is affected by social norm or more specifically is there horizontal social transmission that shapes females and males aspirations differently and further motivates to females to choose female dominant (traditional) jobs and males to choose otherwise. I plan to implement two interventions aimed at understanding and potentially reshaping these norms. In first intervention, I will randomly assign 60 public schools to 1) a control group, 2) an information treatment group, 3) Information treatment and role model treatment. I will evaluate the impact of each treatment on student's career and educational aspirations and other outcomes."
