abstract: "We study the impact of a village level intervention by Raising the Village that provides a package comprising of agricultural and livestock training with subsequent  distribution of seeds and livestock to participants; health education; and finanical literacy training. The sample will be comprised of nearly 3,000 randomly selected households from 100 clusters (nearly 300 villages) in Kagadi and Kyenjojo districts in Uganda. We want to understand the impact of the programme on household and communitiesâ€™ economic and social outcomes."
