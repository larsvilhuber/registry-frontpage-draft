abstract: "In this study we add to the long tradition of assets market experiments going back to the seminal work of Plott and Sunder in the late 80’s and early 90’ by closely looking at the interaction between costly information acquisition and trading purpose. We conduct a laboratory assets market experiment wit an Overlapping Generations framework where there are speculating investors (who do not collect dividends and trade only for capital gains since they won't be "alive" when dividends realize) and dividend-collecting investors (who will be "alive" when state-contingent dividends are paid)."
