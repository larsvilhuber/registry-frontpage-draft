abstract: "The Malawi Ministry of Education is implementing the National Numeracy Programme (NNP). The NNP aims to improve early grade mathematics outcomes. This study will assess the impact of the NNP during the 2023/24 school year. The evaluation will use a randomized controlled trial design with 150 primary schools. Schools will be randomly assigned to treatment and control groups within matched sets of schools. Treatment schools will implement the revised NNP materials and training. Student learning outcomes will be measured using the Early Grade Mathematics Assessment in grades S1-S4. The study will also evaluate impacts on instructional quality using classroom observations. The evaluation will provide rigorous evidence on the impact of the NNP model on foundational numeracy skills, to inform decisions about national scale-up."
