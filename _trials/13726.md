abstract: "This study aims to reduce instances of sexual violence on college campuses in the United States through the distribution of silicone wristbands designed to identify active bystanders â€“ those who are willing to intervene when they observe potential sexual harassment and/or assault. This intervention aims to reduce violence in two ways; firstly, by directly nudging people towards active bystander behaviours either through personal intervention or by allowing victims to identify those who would be willing to help, and secondly by destigmatizing reporting of sexual violence on campuses by making victim support salient on a day-to-day basis.
