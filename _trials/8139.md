abstract: "In October 2020, King County Metro Transit launched asubsidized annual transit pass program  to provide annual transit passes to people with incomes ≤80% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) who also receive cash public benefits. The annual pass allows the holder to ride public transit without paying a fare. The project team is evaluating the impact of King County’s annual pass program on health and wellbeing. The team will also look specifically at outcomes by race to understand whether the impacts of the annual pass are racially equitable. "
