abstract: "What are the barriers to raising revenues in developing countries? With the goal of reducing reliance on foreign aid and natural resources, many governments seek to build tax bases among citizens who operate predominantly within the informal sector.  Recent research has documented the difficulty of encouraging citizens in these contexts to enter the formal sector and regularly pay taxes. This study explores three understudied determinants of low tax compliance. First, low-capacity states are typically weak at protecting property rights. Second, inefficient methods of tax collection may constrain the effectiveness of enforcement. Third, when citizens face high liquidity constrains, compliance may be elastic to the tax burden. We will assess the effect of these factors on tax compliance with a randomized field experiment that implements interventions affecting each of these margins through a collaboration with the Provincial Government of Kasa√Ø Central in Kananga, Democratic Republic of the Congo, from August 2017 to December 2018.  We will vary (1) subsidized access to formal land titles, (2) the method of tax collection---comparing centralized and local collection---and (3) the property tax rates faced by households. This Pre-Analysis Plan presents the research design and introduces the hypotheses pertaining to the land titling intervention.  It will be updated after a pilot of the tax intervention in early 2018 to include hypotheses pertaining to taxation before endline data collection."
