abstract: "To combat offshore tax evasion, a large number of countries have agreed to exchange bank information about financial assets and income. In collaboration with the Danish tax authorities, we conduct a study of this enforcement policy. We first identify taxpayers whose self-reported foreign financial income is significantly smaller than the corresponding income categories reported by foreign banks.  We then randomly select taxpayers for a “treatment group” who will be subject to a targeted tax audit and a “control group” who will not be subject to a tax audit. The main goal of the experimental intervention is to estimate the effect of a targeted tax audit on subsequent compliance."
