abstract: "The profitability of investments in green/sustainable investment classes (relative to conventional investments) depends on expectations about the development of future CO2 prices. This development is naturally subject to uncertainty. We investigate the effect of uncertainty about future CO2 prices on green investments. We implement a randomized survey experiment in the German Internet Panel (GIP) in which we manipulate uncertainty about future CO2 prices, while keeping average expectations constant across treatment groups. We use a novel approach for this manipulation in which we randomly vary the response scale on which respondents can reply to a question about their CO2 price expectations. The outcome variable of interest is a survey item in which respondents face a hypothetical investment decision and indicate how much they would invest in a green investment class. "
