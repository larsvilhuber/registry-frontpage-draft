abstract: "We describe the analysis plan for an online intervention designed to examine how inducing participants to think about the historical nature of frontiers in Latin America may exacerbate or placate the effects of a ruling by an international court about a territorial dispute between Nicaragua and Colombia. The study will be conducted online with Colombian adults. We outline the study design, the treatments, the main heterogeneous treatment effects that we will examine, and the econometric strategies for the analysis."
