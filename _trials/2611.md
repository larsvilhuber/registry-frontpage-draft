abstract: "In July 2016, the estimated value of uncollected traffic and parking infringements in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) was approximately $33 million. The aim of this trial is to test the effectiveness of letters on the collection of traffic and parking fines. The trial focuses on debt cases that are more than six months old. Two treatment letters are being tested. The first letter addresses social norms. The second letter highlights that unpaid fines do not go away. The control group does not receive a letter.
