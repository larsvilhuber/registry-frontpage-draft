abstract: "In many domains, authorities rely on sending notifications to enforce compliance with outstanding payments. Typically there are laws that impose constraints on format and content of the notifications. As a result, the key information is often presented in a way that is hard to understand, making it difficult to correctly infer important attributes of the payment liabilities. This is crucial, as many of these attributes play - at least for a fully rational, attentive and cognitively unconstrained decision maker - a significant role in shaping individual responses to the notifications. This project studies the impact from increasing the salience of different attributes hidden in such complex legal texts. In particular, we focus on payment notifications for drivers who receive speeding tickets. Within a randomized controlled trial, we vary whether the payment deadline, the penalty for missing the deadline, or both features of the notification are made salient to the receiver. We then study the treatments' impact on the timing of payments for the speeding tickets."
