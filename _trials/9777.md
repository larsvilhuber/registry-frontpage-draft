abstract: "In recent years, many colleges and universities are reconsidering their use of standardized test scores in their admissions processes. The debate has gained new urgency in recent years after COVID-19 forced most schools to adopt "test-optional" admissions policies. This study implements an experiment in which a selective northeast university's admissions officers re-evaluate real applications from past years with altered or omitted standardized test scores to determine how the presence or absence of test scores affects admissions decisions. The results from this experiment will answer the following questions: (1) How does a test-optional policy affect the way that admissions officers evaluate applications? (2) How do these effects vary across students, both by level of academic preparation and student background? In combination with descriptive results from other sources, these findings will characterize the winners and losers from test-optional policies and reveal the functional role of standardized tests in selective university admissions."
