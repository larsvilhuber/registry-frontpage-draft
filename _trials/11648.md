abstract: "Economists and social psychologists have long been trying to determine the behavioral factors that result in gender gaps in economic outcomes. One underlying factor is suggested to be women's lower willingness to negotiate than men. The gender differences in levels of entitlement with respect to pay can explain the gender negotiation divide. This research stream suggests that women feel less deserving of higher pay than men, are unsure about the worth of their labor, have lower performance expectations, and take less credit for their success. Here, we study whether women’s concerns regarding what they think they are entitled to drive their lower likelihood of initiating negotiations. Women’s lack of entitlements may stem from the differences in how men and women evaluate themselves and compare own with other people. Using a controlled online experiment, we investigate the role of entitlements on gender differences in willingness to negotiate."
