abstract: "For this study, we will measure the extent to which preferences are consistent in the short run. Previous research on high-frequency preference variation has been limited partly due to a lack of appropriate data sources. In this study, we propose to address this limitation by conducting a survey that elicits individual preferences over risk and time repeated over the course of several weeks."
