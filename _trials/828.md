abstract: "Consumers might choose to purchase certain products to show to others their own economic achievements and thus gain social status. Purchasing an exclusive product may also shape one' view of oneself, regardless of the opinion of others. We consider premium credit cards, which can be demanded not only for the services and benefits that they provide, but also for social image and self-image motives. Since qualification requirements for these cards are usually high, this is a financial product generally available only to wealthy individuals. This exclusivity makes it a well-know symbol of success, which might enhance the owner's social image and self-image. We design a phone marketing experiment to disentangle the roles of self- versus social image considerations as well as instrumental benefits in explaining the demand for a platinum card."
