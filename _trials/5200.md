abstract: "We employ a randomized discrete choice experiment on a large on-demand staffing platform to estimate the labor demand for workers with a past criminal conviction (WCCs) under different policies and market conditions. Employers using the platform will have the option to have WCCs assigned to their vacancies at a randomly chosen wage subsidy, both with and without the option of crime and safety insurance and increased performance screening, and under different hypothetical labor market conditions. Employer choices at different wage subsidies will yield willingness to pay (WTP) estimates for this population of jobseekers under different counterfactual policies. These estimates will also allow us to estimate a labor demand function. "
