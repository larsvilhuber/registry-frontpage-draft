abstract: "Little is known whether low-cost behavioral interventions may increase the uptake of cancer screening programs in the development context. To fill in this gap, we run a randomized controlled trial to study the impact of invitation letter and reminder manipulations on a cervical cancer screening program participation rate in the poorest region in the Republic of Armenia. 
We are mainly interested in the effects of two manipulations of the invitation letters: (i) enhancing the salience of the potential negative consequences of not participating in the screening program; (ii) enforcing the importance of the checkup for the sake of one’s family members. Moreover, we are interested in assessing the effects of “treatment-specific” reminders sent a week before the screening date. 
The randomized controlled trial is run by Armenia National SDG Innovation Lab (a joint initiative of the Government of the Republic of Armenia and the United Nations), in collaboration with the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Armenia. The experimental sample consists of 20800 females aged 30-60, representing roughly 50% of the target population in the region.
