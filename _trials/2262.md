abstract: "Universal access to safe drinking water and sanitation continues to be a major development challenge in several countries in Latin America and The Caribbean, and even more so in the rural areas. In fact, eight of every ten people without access to an improved drinking water source, and nine of every ten people without an improved sanitation facility, live in rural areas (WHO/UNICEF, Joint Monitoring Programme, 2015). 
   
Household access to safe water and improved sanitation are considered development goals in their own right, but in addition, lack of water and basic sanitation contribute toward higher prevalence of disease, anemia, malnutrition and poor child development. Children under five years of age are particularly vulnerable, as bad sanitation conditions and use of unimproved water sources expose them to parasites and fecal bacteria that causes infection (Kremer and Zwane, 2007; Ngure et.al. 2013; Burger and Esrey, 1995). Recent research also makes the link between poor water, sanitation and hygiene conditions of the environment and early cognitive and socioemotional development in small children (Ngure, 2014).     

The Bolivia’s Ministry of Environment and Water has launched a water and sanitation program in rural areas of the departments of La Paz, Cochabamba, Chuquisaca and Potosi. The program’s objective is to increase access to safe water and improved sanitation by expanding water and sanitation infrastructure in small rural communities with low coverage levels. The program targets small communities with less than 500 people. 

The program includes an experimental impact evaluation design where eligible communities are randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. After almost one year of the end of the intervention, the evaluation will estimate the effects of the program on intermediate indicators of utilization of improved water and sanitation facilities, and hygiene practices. The study will also evaluate the impact of the intervention on prevalence of water-related diseases such as diarrhea, and the use of time. Impact "
