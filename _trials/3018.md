abstract: "My Student’s Team is a randomized control trial, implemented with over 3,000 student participants in five charter schools and four public school districts during the 2016-17 and 2017-18 school years, which aims to evaluate the effect of engaging students’ social support networks on student success. In the study, students’ parents name an adult “supporter” whom they permit to receive school-related information about their children. Participants are randomly assigned to either a treatment or control group. Supporters of students in the treatment group receive personalized and actionable communications, such as class schedules, progress reports, attendance updates, notifications of upcoming tests, and tips on how to support the student’s education via mail and/or text. The primary outcomes of interest are attendance and GPA. For the most detailed and up-to-date analysis plan, please visit: https://osf.io/62cyb/."
