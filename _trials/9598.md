abstract: "The World Bank estimates that it will cost approximately USD 100 billion per year to meet the Sustainable Development Goalsâ€™ aspirations of ensuring safe and affordable water and sanitation for all by 2030 (Hutton & Varughese, 2016).  Donor funds are not sufficient to meet this funding gap, which means funds will need to be secured through tax revenue or user fees (i.e., tariffs). Utilities in low- and middle-income countries charge customers far below the full cost of providing water and sanitation services and tariffs will need to be increased to help finance the infrastructure needed to achieve universal access to water and sanitation services. Even at the relatively low prices utilities charge customers for water and sanitation services, many customers fail to pay their bills on time and have arrears (negative balances) on their accounts. Indeed, it is not uncommon for 40-50% of customers to have balances on their accounts. Reducing arrears and encouraging on-time bill payment is thus an important component of getting utilities in the Global South on the path to financial sustainability. There are several ways in which utilities can encourage customers to pay their bills in a timely manner. This study examines whether one-time arrears (debt) forgiveness can encourage future on-time bill payment. "
