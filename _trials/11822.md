abstract: "As electric vehicle penetration increases it will stress the capacity of local distribution networks. This study is designed to assess the potential to shift electric vehicle (EV) charging times to reduce strain on the distribution system. We consider two approaches, 1) time of use pricing—offering a discount for individuals to charge in the off-peak hours and 2) managed charging—offering a per-kwh discount for consumers to let a 3rd party software to schedule charging times throughout the charging session to reduce the distribution network peak.  We also assess individuals’ willingness to accept joining an incentive program for shifting charging and whether this varies with experience with managed charging. "
