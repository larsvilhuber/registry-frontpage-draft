abstract: "Most of the existing studies on climate change adaptation are descriptive or explanatory, and focused on the socio-economic determinants of the farmersâ€™ perception and adaptation. We design a pilot theory-based Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to test the impact of providing smallholder farmers with weather-related information through mobile phone SMS. Our outcome variables include labor, yield and farm income. "
