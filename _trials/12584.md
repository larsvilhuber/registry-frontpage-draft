abstract: "What is the right level of decentralization? In a standard principal-agent model, principal(s) may delegate decision-making authority to agents to take advantage of the agents' superior information, which is offset as the principal(s) lose(s) complete control and the agent can pursue their own objectives (to a certain extent). However, this information advantage is typically for certain easily observable elements. Does this information advantage hold for elements such as intertemporal effort allocation which has harder characteristics associated with it such as present bias and the level of sophistication on part of the agent. For the latter, a large literature has establishment the existence of naivete on part of agents themselves. Our idea is that an agent might herself be unaware of her own present-bias and thus an external actor, a principal, may be able to better ascertain this about her and thus make better choices. 

Further, if an agent does still possess superior information, the question for the public sector, which has multiple decision-making layers, and multiple principals is: what advantage do agents have over different levels of authority? Are principals closer to the agent better informed and how can their involvement improve performance? We conduct a field experiment to understand the informational advantage of community health workers, their immediate supervisors and senior-most Department of Health officials. However, this question is not just relevant for the public sector, but in any organization including private sector organizations, where different levels of authority exist.
