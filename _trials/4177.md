abstract: "This project aims to understand individuals' preferences for information about feedback on their own performance. In particular, 
our goal is to learn how preferences over information about own performance are shaped by the presence of strategic incentives, subjective judgement by others and revelation of one's feedback to others. We will then also test the differences in these preferences by gender and its implications for belief formation about one's own performance.
