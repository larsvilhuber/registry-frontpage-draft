abstract: "The impact evaluation of the Cote d’Ivoire Youth Employment and Skills Development project (PEJEDEC) seeks to assess the short-term impact of a public works program targeted to low-skilled vulnerable youth, as well as to identify pathways to improve employment outcomes and raise productivity of participants upon graduation. The study is designed as a multi-arms randomized control trial embedded in a large-scale government-implemented project financed by the World Bank. The first objective is to test the effectiveness of the program in improving participants’ employment, earnings, welfare and risky behaviors the short-term, as well as spill-over of labor supply and earnings of other household members. Individual randomization of applicants into the program allows identifying these short-term impacts. The second objective of is to document the cost-effectiveness of alternative strategies to help poor and vulnerable youth graduate from temporary public works program by entering self-employment, setting-up household enterprises or accessing wage employment. The cost-effectiveness of alternative graduation pathways can be assessed by randomization of program participants into three groups: (i) participation in public works, (ii) participation in public works plus basic entrepreneurship training to facilitate entry into self-employment and improve productivity in household enterprises, and (iii) participation in public works plus training in job search skills and sensitization on wage employment opportunities to facilitate access to wage jobs.
