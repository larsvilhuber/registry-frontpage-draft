abstract: "This study examines whether employers use nativity status (foreign-born vs native-born) when making hiring decisions. I designed and carried out a national audit study across 18 U.S. Metropolitan Areas in low-skill and high-skilled occupations. The nativity status, race, and gender were randomly assigned to four matched resumes. Results from the field experiment provide the first causal estimates of hiring discrimination on the basis of nativity in the United States. "
