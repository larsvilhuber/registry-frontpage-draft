abstract: "Take-up of safety net programs in the United States is often incomplete, ranging from 84% for SNAP and Medicaid adults to 25% for TANF. Administrative hassles involved with proving initial and continued eligibility, which often require substantial effort by enrollees, may contribute to the large number of eligible but unenrolled individuals and families. The expiration of the nationwide public health emergency related to COVID-19 will trigger eligibility redeterminations for tens of millions of American households and will require many of these households to go through a burdensome and confusing eligibility redetermination process. We propose to study the effect of these administrative hassles in the Medicaid program, where it is estimated that 89 million beneficiaries will be going through the eligibility redetermination process in 2023. 

Our study has two goals: (1) assess the role of inaccurate beneficiary contact information and administrative frictions in impeding eligibility redetermination and (2) assess the effects of continued Medicaid enrollment on beneficiary health, labor supply, and well-being. We propose a set of scalable interventions, ranging from low- to medium-cost, that are designed to improve the targeting of Medicaid renewal forms, strengthen outreach, and make it easier to complete redetermination applications. 

In partnership with a community partner conducting outreach to individuals up for Medicaid renewal, we will randomize (1) whether individuals' contact information is updated through a third-party vendor, (2) whether an individual is likely to be contacted by the community partner to be notified of their need to complete the renewal process (if scarce resources mean that the community partner cannot outreach all individuals on their contact list) and (3) whether an individual receives application assistance "
