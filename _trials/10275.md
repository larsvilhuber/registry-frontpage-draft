abstract: "The study aims to evaluate the impacts of a large-scale flagship social protection program in Tanzania, the Productive Social Safety Net (PSSN). The PSSN is based on integrated interventions targeted to the poorest households: conditional cash transfers, a labor-intensive public works (PW) program, and a livelihood program that includes business training and a large business grant. The impact evaluation study is conducted in villages from 17 regions in Mainland and Zanzibar. It uses a multi-arm cluster (villages) RCT design to examine the relative combined impacts of the self-employment support component (i.e., livelihood) and the wage employment component (i.e., public works) as part of a large-scale expansion of these components. It further cross-randomizes the mode of payment (digital vs. manual) to understand the impact of digital e-payment, with particular attention to gender outcomes."
