abstract: "The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the leading causes of cervical cancer, one of the major public health problems in the developing world. Vaccines against HPV are available since 2006, yet vaccination coverage is very low. As with many other preventive health investments, adoption is very low despite their large economic and social benefits. In this project, we implement large-scale interventions based on behavioral science to boost vaccination rates using cost-effective strategies based on SMS campaigns with parents.   "
