abstract: "We aim to study how gender norms – tasks sharing, and gender roles - affect intra-household decisions about labor market participation and the likelihood for each spouse to accept flexible work arrangements. We will first conduct a baseline survey representative for cohabiting couples in Bogotá to elicit gender norms concerning labor market participation and willingness to accept flexible jobs. The objective is to identify whether Colombia is a context of pluralistic ignorance, namely whether Colombians hold an opinion, but mistakenly believe that others hold the opposite opinion. As a result, individuals behave in ways that are incongruent with their personal opinions and congruent, instead with what they mistakenly believe to be the norm. Contingent on finding this evidence, in a second step, we will conduct a discrete choice experiment among couples where we will measure how the willingness to work and the propensity to accept flexible work will vary by gender and according to experimental variations: (i) the presence of the other spouse when making one’s choices, (ii) providing or not the information about what is the average preferences of other couples from the same neighborhood about female labor force participation and male and female willingness to accept a flexible job. This project will make an original contribution by drawing a direct link between the growing literature on the demand for flexibility at the workplace and the one on intra-family decisions. "
