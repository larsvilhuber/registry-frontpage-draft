abstract: "The BALIKA program evaluates the impact of three community-based skills building programs to address child marriage among adolescent girls in rural Bangladesh. The study uses a cluster randomized controlled trial design with four arms: ARM1 offered educational support, ARM2 offered interventions to promote gender rights awareness, ARM3 offered livelihoods training, and ARM4 served as the control. The three intervention arms differed in terms of the nature of skills provided over an 18-month long intervention period when all adolescent girls were offered 144 hours of skills training in village centers. The survey sample  comprised 11,609 respondents at baseline among whom 9,982 (85.9%) respondents were successfully re-interviewed at the endline survey. In intent-to-treat as well as per protocol, discrete time survival analysis we showed that the risk of child marriage (<18 years) for adolescent girls declined significantly in all intervention arms relative to those living in control arm villages."
