abstract: "We conduct a survey experiment in two waves in Germany to assess peopleâ€™s beliefs about the extent of labor market discrimination and to examine to what extent these beliefs drive support for anti-discrimination policies. In the first wave, we elicit beliefs about discrimination by asking how likely a female candidate with Turkish-sounding names is to receive a callback for an interview relative to an identical female candidates with a German-sounding name. To isolate the role of religious signals, We assess beliefs about the callback rate for candidates with the same Turkish-sounding name with and without headscarf. We then provide a random subset of our respondents with information about the results from a correspondence study that found evidence of discrimination in the labor market. We design the experiment to differentiate the effect of two sources of information, namely academic versus newspaper. Subsequently, we assess belief updates immediately after the information treatment and measure self-reported support for anti-discrimination policies. Two weeks after the first wave, we verify the stability of belief updates and stated preferences in a follow-up survey. Exogenous variation in the beliefs induced by the treatment enables us to assess how beliefs affect the support for anti-discrimination policies that target helping migrants in the labor market."
