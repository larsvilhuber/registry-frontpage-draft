abstract: "Although vast resources have been directed towards financial education programs aimed at improving poor financial knowledge and outcomes in developing countries, there is little rigorous evidence, to date, on the impact of these programs on financial behavior. In this trial, with a sample of 1,300 individuals in India, we measure the effect of a 5-week financial education program on financial numeracy, awareness, attitudes, and outcomes through a survey and financial knowledge test administered to all study participants 2-3 weeks after the program. In addition, we test the importance of goal setting and financial counseling within a subset of the population treated with the financial education program. "
