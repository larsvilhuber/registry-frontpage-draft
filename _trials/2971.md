abstract: "Research on repeated choosing and choice complexity has demonstrated that decision-making by individuals uses up scarce psychological resources and can affect both decision outcome and an individual’s satisfaction with their choice. Given this, people will sometimes avoid deciding, opting instead to use an external device such as a coin flip (Dwenger 2014). Levitt (2016) argues that when people are facing big life decisions and find themselves at an impasse, letting a coin decide can increase happiness. We assert that responsibility aversion plays a role in this outcome and design an experiment to assess this effect of the use of external decision devices. Participants engage in a dictator game with a “take” framing with two potential choices for the dictator: (1) take $7 from the other player’s endowment, leaving the partner with only $3, or (2) take $3, leaving the other player with $7. We hypothesize that those who are directed by a coin flip to take $7 will score lower on a measure of negative affect and higher on a measure of positive affect than those who made the same decision of their own accord. We also assert that positive self-assessment will be greater in the coin flip condition and that this will free these participants from the need to engage in subsequent moral cleansing. Finally, we test to determine whether people are willing to pay a non-zero amount to transfer the decision-making power to the coin flip in anticipation of the avoidance of guilt feelings."
