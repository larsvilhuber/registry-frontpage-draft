abstract: "Recent clinical trials find transformative effects of psychedelic drugs on mental health, prosociality, and spirituality. These findings have broad-ranging implications for policy, with some polities now decriminalizing psychedelics, and some psychedelic-assisted therapies close to receiving approval for mass use. Despite these high stakes, existing evidence suffers from three glaring omissions. First, existing clinical trials use very small samples. Second, we know little of the effects of psychedelics outside of controlled clinical settings. Third, no work estimates effects on economic outcomes. We address these omissions with an RCT in collaboration with a large ayahuasca center in Brazil.
