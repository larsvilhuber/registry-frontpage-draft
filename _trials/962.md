abstract: "Many adolescent girls in Kenya face considerable risks and vulnerabilities that affect their education status, health, and general well-being. The Adolescent Girls Initiative–Kenya (AGI-K) will deliver multi-sectoral interventions for over 5,000 girls ages 11–14 in two marginalized areas of Kenya: 1) Kibera slums in Nairobi and 2) Wajir County in Northeastern Kenya. These interventions will be implemented for two years and will comprise a combination of girl-level, household-level, and community-level interventions. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be used to compare the impact of four different packages of interventions, including a cost-effectiveness component, in order to assess if and how intervening in early adolescence will impact girls’ life chances. Using a longitudinal design, quantitative data collection will be consist of a baseline survey, a midline survey (at the end of the 2 year intervention), and a follow-up survey (2 years post-intervention).
