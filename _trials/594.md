abstract: "Anxiety is a condition of persistent and uncontrollable nervousness, stress, and worry that is triggered by anticipation of future events, memories of past events, or ruminations over day-to-day events, both trivial and major, with disproportionate fears of catastrophic consequences‚Äù American Psychological Association (2003). Individuals with anxiety experience emotions more easily, quickly and intensely thus affecting all stages of emotional processing (Mennin et al, 2006). It then becomes a challenge for these children as anxiety constantly affects their academic with learning disability, educational under achievement and social functioning (Swanson & Howell, 1996, Wine, 1971, 1982, McLoone, Hudson, & Rapee, 2006, Spurgaitis, 2006). Studies have found that Mindfulness leads to significant decreases in anxiety and increase in the ability to pay attention to stimuli in a non-threatening manner (Napoli, Krech & Holley, 2005) along with improved well-being, calmness, relaxation, improved sleep, less reactivity, increased self-care, self-awareness Wall (2005) and it also allows for enhanced level exposure and acceptance of emotions for children with anxiety Semple & Lee (2011). The present study is aimed at applying Mindfulness based Cognitive therapy on children with anxiety.
