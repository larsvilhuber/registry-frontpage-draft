abstract: "We conduct a laboratory group experiment to investigate the market behavior of participants who must trade across two different markets using two different currencies within a continuous double auction market mechanism. This setting is designed to grossly mimic the competition between traditional fiat currencies, such as the Dollar, that are issued by central banks, and so-called crypto-currencies, such as the bitcoin. We consider two dimensions along which these currencies differ from each other. First, while the quantity of, say, Dollars tends to grow over time, Bitcoin, and other so-called stable coins, are deflationary by design because their total quantity is bounded. Second, using traditional fiat currencies or crypto-currencies may entail various transaction costs, for instance in the form of various tax rates on goods and services purchased with each currency. Using an experimental design, we investigate the consequences of these two features on currency adoption for trade. "
