abstract: "We design a survey experiment in China to measure people’s economic rationality in risk preference domain and compare this result from the survey experiment with economic rationality in food domain from the observation data of supermarket scanner data. Our motivation stems from the facts that previous studies about economic rationality are mostly studied in one domain alone and lab or field separately, but direct cross-domain or lab vs. field comparisons have not been attempted to date. Using only one domain to measure people’s economic rationality to rate their decision quality in the life need to take external validity into account and deserve further investigation. Our study will shed light on the little known aspects of equivalence between decision quality outside the laboratory and in lab environment. Firstly, we analyze consumer's decision quality between vegetables and meat from supermarket scanner data in Hunan Province, China, using GARP analysis. Secondly, We will launch a large-scale choice-based conjoint survey experiment in the same sample using a budget line task extended from Choi et al. (2007) and Choi et al. (2014). Thirdly, we will investigate the external validity of economic rationality of economic rationality involved in same participants in supermarket shopping and risk task game. "
