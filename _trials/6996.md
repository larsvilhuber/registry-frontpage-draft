abstract: "We conduct a survey-based choice experiment in order to jointly estimate endogenous discount rates and risk curvatures associated with the publicâ€™s willingness to pay (WTP) for long-term groundwater management in the Mississippi River Valley Alluvial Aquifer. The experimental choice design uses variation in the timing of the payment mechanism and in the probability of implementation to identify endogenous time and risk preferences, respectively. We include treatments that do not include the probability necessary for estimating risk preferences in order to examine its effect on the estimation of the time parameter, and we include treatments to examine information effects. We also examine the effect on time and risk preferences resulting from treatments where respondents are allowed to select their preferred payment schedule (with and without the probability for risk preferences) and a treatment where respondents can assign different percentage probabilities (adding to 100%) to their likelihood of selecting alternative payment schedules. In addition to time and risk preferences, we also estimate marginal WTP for groundwater services (jobs in agriculture, job security in agriculture, wildlife habitat, and wildlife habitat security) and for two distinct management policies (surface water infrastructure and managed aquifer recharge) relative to the status quo of subsidies for best management practices."
