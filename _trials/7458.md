abstract: "In this survey experiment, we expose one third of respondents to information about COVID-19 cases and deaths in four states where a disproportionate share falls on whites; one third of respondents view similar information collected from four states where a disproportionate share of cases and deaths fall on black residents. The remaining share of respondents constitute the control group and they see information that is not disaggregated by race. All respondents are subsequently asked about their views on 12 policy proposals that include redistributive policies (on wealth taxes, income taxes, unemployment benefits), public health measures (whether to reopen businesses), support for small businesses and large corporations, and vaccine priority. The research question we seek to answer in this experiment is whether respondents differ significantly in their responses to these policy proposals based on the information they receive about the burden of COVID-19 cases and deaths."
