abstract: "This project assesses the extent to which information about student performance on standardized tests influences perceptions of the recent state takeover of Houston Independent School District (HISD) by Texas Education Agency. Specifically, we test whether providing information to survey respondents about test performance in the HISD schools most directly impacted by the takeover—and growth in performance in these schools—influences ratings of the reform (overall and its individual components), ratings of the newly installed district leadership, and stated preferences of which future actions respondents would prefer policymakers pursue. The survey experiment also collects data on respondents' perceptions of the political process that led to the takeover and how it was implemented. We test whether the role of information in shaping respondent preferences is moderated by proximity to HISD as well as the mediating role of process perceptions."
