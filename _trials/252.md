abstract: "One of the oldest questions in the design of a civil service system is the role of incentives, yet there is little rigorous evidence on their impact. In tax, performance pay for tax collectors could increase effort and revenues, but it might come at a cost if taxpayers experience greater pressure by collectors especially if the latter resort to extortion and over-taxation. We investigate these issues by conducting a large-scale, randomized field experiment. Working with the Punjab, Pakistan provincial government, property tax inspectors were randomly allocated into one of three high-powered incentive schemes or a control group for up to two fiscal years. We investigate the impacts on tax revenues, accuracy of tax assessments, and satisfaction with interactions with the tax department."
