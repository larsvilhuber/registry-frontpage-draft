abstract: "This paper offers novel experimental evidence that crime can be successfully reduced by changing the situational environment that potential victims and offenders face. We focus on a ubiquitous but surprisingly understudied feature of the urban landscape --- street lighting --- and report the first experimental evidence on the effect of street lighting on crime. Through a unique public partnership in New York City, temporary street lights were randomly allocated to public housing developments. We find evidence that communities that were assigned more lighting experienced sizable reductions in nighttime outdoor crimes. "
