abstract: "Around the world, 1.3 billion people have no access to electricity, including around 400 million Indians, most of whom live in rural areas.  Evidence on the welfare benefits of electricity access is critical for devising rational energy and climate policies. At the same time, the electricity sectors in developing countries are woefully inefficient, and their rapid growth will not be sustainable if it relies on burning ever more fossil fuels. Small, decentralized energy projects will therefore play an important role in providing universal access and may reduce the carbon-intensity of electricity load growth. 

The experimental design will offer solar micro-grid connections to households in areas with limited or no electricity access in rural North-West Bihar.  The experiment allots 100 sample villages into one of three experimental treatment arms: solar micro-grid service at the prevailing price of INR 200 per month, solar micro-grid service at a subsidized price of INR 100 per month, and a control arm with no offer of service.  There are two main research aims.  First, by making offers of electricity service at different prices and measuring take-up, to measure how much people value solar electricity.  The value of solar will be compared to substitute energy sources such as decentralized electricity generated with diesel fuel.  Second, by collecting data on economic and social outcomes, to compare newly connected villages to those without electricity and estimate the welfare benefits of access to electricity for poor rural households.  Economic and social outcomes include electricity access, energy expenditures, time use and income, as well as potential indirect benefits of electricity use such as reading comprehension and informedness through information technology.
