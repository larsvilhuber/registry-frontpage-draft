abstract: "Exploiting exogenous variation in inflation expectations driven by randomized information treatments, we examine to what extent the inflation expectations influence the current household expenditure in Japan. We find that a rise in inflation expectations has a positive effect on the current household expenditure. In addition, our estimated intertemporal elasticity of substitution is large (about unity), suggesting that the intertemporal substitution plays an important role in our analysis. "
