abstract: "This paper investigates the relationship between self-chosen goals, commitment, and worker performance using data collected from online workers engaged in real effort tasks. Our findings show that high-ability workers respond positively to self-chosen goals, while low-ability workers exhibit a negative response. Furthermore, when commitment is introduced alongside self-chosen goals, it has a positive direct impact on the performance of low-ability workers and also indirectly influences performance through goal setting. However, for high-ability workers, commitment has a positive direct impact but a negative indirect impact through goal setting. Alternatively, our study suggests that the combination of prosocial information and commitment yields positive effects on goal setting. Specifically, we find that providing prosocial information enables participants to set challenging but attainable goals, addressing the limitations observed in the commitment-only treatment. "
