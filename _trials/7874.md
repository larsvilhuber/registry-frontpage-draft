abstract: "Targeting social protection programs, including public works has been a central issue for resource strapped developing countries facing unreliable data on target beneficiaries’ socioeconomic status. Impacts of public works program is further complicated by selective targeting. We design a unique two-stage randomized control trial and use experimental variation in beneficiary selection procedures to examine two primary research questions of interest. First, how effective are the targeting mechanisms (chief selection, community selection, and public lottery) in ensuring poor and vulnerable households’ participation in public works programs? Second, what is the impact of having access to public works program (through public lottery) on individual labor market outcomes and household welfare? We will exploit experimental variation in both program targeting and access to public works programs to produce rigorous impact estimates on both material and non-material outcomes. In the registered pre-analysis plan we provide a detailed summary of the key chosen outcomes and associated variable definitions to be used for computing the intent-to-treat effects, local average treatment effects, and sub-group average treatment effects, accounting for both Type I and Type II error in statistical analysis. We also present our plans for handling missing values, outliers and measurement error in data."
