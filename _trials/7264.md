abstract: "We study the effect of role model gender on women in an entrepreneurship program. In the two arms of our RCT, volunteer Malaysians aged 18-28 are randomly assigned to an online course that utilizes either exclusively male or exclusively female exemplar entrepreneurs. These exemplars include both the examples and cases provided in class and two live talks given by Malaysian entrepreneurs. We hypothesize that treatment in the female arm will lower the degree of male stereotyping of entrepreneurship for both male and female participants. We also hypothesize that this male stereotyping will mediate pre-post changes in entrepreneurial intention (EI) and entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE) for women but not men, so we expect strong correlations between our measure of gendered entrepreneurial stereotype and EI and ESE. Finally, we expect the female exemplar treatment to have a positive treatment effect on  EI and ESE for women but not for men."
