abstract: "In this paper, we study how communication shapes suspicion. The experiment uses a sender-receiver setup where the sender has a low probability of having misaligned incentives with their matched receiver. We focus on the impact of open communication on the receivers’ suspicion as measured by the size of the deviation from the senders’ recommendation before and after the communication. Based on previously preregistered treatments, communication significantly reduces suspicion. However, communication contents do not offer sufficiently nuanced insights on which aspects of communication tend to reduce or trigger suspicion. Hence, we add an additional treatment to address it.
