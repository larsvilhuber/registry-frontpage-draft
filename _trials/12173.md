abstract: "As businesses and everyday life slowly return to pre-pandemic activity, one point is becoming clear: The home office isn’t about to shut down. In his research and discussions with hundreds of managers across different industries, Prof.Nicholas Bloom finds that about 70 percent of firms — from tiny companies to massive multinationals like Apple, Google, Citi, and HSBC — plan to implement some form of hybrid working arrangements so their employees can divide their time between collaborating with colleagues on-site and working from home.

Hybrid arrangements balance the benefits of being in the office in person — greater ability to collaborate, innovate, and build a culture — with the benefits of quiet and the lack of commuting that comes from working from home. There is a big question of how many days and also what happens if you have MF together.

We are conducting a hybrid WFH experiment at Qunar, a 1000+ employee, public-listed Chinese travel agency. 800 qualified managerial and IT-professional employees form more than 50 project teams, and the teams were randomly assigned into four groups (0 days WFH – control; 1 day WFH – Friday; 2 days WFH – Wednesday and Friday; 3 days WFH – Monday Wednesday and Friday), either to exercise this hybrid working option or in the office for 9 months.
