abstract: "The aim of the project is to test and develop a new strategy to promote the choice of healthy food. We will run a lab experiment to investigate the impact of the introduction of a Pay-What-You-Want scheme on individual food choices and to evaluate its efficiency compared to standard monetary incentives (and absence of incentives). The PWYW scheme offers the subjects the opportunity to personally determine how much they are willing to pay for the healthier choice, reflecting their intrinsic motivation. By promoting healthy food consumption with a PWYW strategy, we hypostatize to have a positive effect on sales and consumption, without adverse effects in terms of socio-economic inequalities in nutrition and policy unpopularity (Niebylski et al., 2015). Low-income and other vulnerable groups are in fact differently sensible to unhealthy food prices, such that unhealthy food taxes might become regressive. PWYW allows consumers to self-select the price they want to pay, generating endogenous incentives that can potentially reach more participants."
