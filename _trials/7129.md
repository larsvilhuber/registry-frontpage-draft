abstract: "Research demonstrates that leaders vary extensively in their capabilities to scaffold human potential. Still, we have limited understanding of how different leadership behaviors cause workers to be engaged and motivated to work hard and smart. We conduct a field experiment in a large corporation to investigate effects of supportive leadership behaviors on worker satisfaction, engagement and performance. The CEO encourages all employees to participate in group discussions to provide input on a question of strategic importance during work hours. The employees with no personnel responsibility are randomly matched to employees with personnel responsibility (leader) to form groups of three or four members, all from different companies within the corporation to maximize the likelihood of them not knowing each other. Using block randomization, the leaders are randomized into treatment and control. Treated leaders receives a brief leadership-training promoting more supportive leadership behaviors. We investigate treatment impact on worker satisfaction, engagement, and performance in the group task. "
