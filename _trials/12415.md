abstract: "Who benefits from VAT tax evasion, and how are the rents distributed between sellers and buyers? How much of the “saved” taxes does the seller pass on to the consumer, and what does this depend on? When the tax of a commodity or service is evaded, it is unclear who reaps the benefits. While the general distributional effect of taxes (incidence) has been frequently studied in the literature, little is known about how the rents of evasion are split between consumers and producers. While some theoretical general-equilibrium models would predict factor prices adjust so that firm owners do not benefit from evasion in equilibrium, we have very limited empirical evidence, which so far has only been based on online surveys. This project aims to quantify the incidence of evasion by conducting an innovative survey-based field experiment in Italy. Thanks to a randomized treatment design, we elicit average price differentials by the method of payment in order to back out what portion of evaded taxes are passed on to consumers."
