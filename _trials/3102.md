abstract: "This study employs a list experiment (item count experiment) to produce an estimate of the share of respondents who voted for Vladimir Putin in the March 18, 2018, presidential election in Russia while shielding them from social desirability pressures that might be involved in asking the question directly. By comparing the experimentâ€™s result with the results of direct questioning about voting behavior, we will gain (a) an estimate of the extent to which respondents are insincerely reporting their voting behavior in direct questioning and (b) the opportunity to study the relative costs and benefits of studying the correlates of voting behavior using a list-experiment count as the dependent variable instead of the standard practice of using answers to a direct question on voting."
