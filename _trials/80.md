abstract: "The Church of Uganda maintains a large network of youth fellowship groups, based out of village churches around the country. These groups were targeted for variations of a financial education and group savings account intervention because they offer a high level of trust among members, as well as a high degree of consistency across the different groups, relative to other youth group structures in Uganda. Each group has an average of 25 members with a well-balanced mix of genders and occupations.

The evaluation examines two interventions: a financial education curriculum (a knowledge-based intervention) and a specially-designed youth group savings account (an access-based intervention). The curriculum was developed in partnership with Straight Talk Foundation – a highly successful Ugandan organization specializing in communication to youth – based on the Your Future, Your Money curriculum from the Global Financial Education Program and materials from Binti Pamoja, an organization that promotes the rights of teenage girls.

The ten-session, fifteen-hour curriculum focused primarily on teaching concepts and skills for improving savings behavior, ranging from role-playing the differences between saving and borrowing to achieve a goal, to how to keep a budget, to strategies for successfully discussing sensitive topics around money.

The group savings account was designed without fees and with simple account-opening procedures to minimize the barriers that were found in focus group discussions to most discourage young Ugandans from opening accounts.

Two hundred forty church groups, representative of all of Uganda’s regions, were selected based on their level of activity and access to district capitals. The sample population was randomly assigned into four groups, including one group which received neither intervention and served as the comparison group."
