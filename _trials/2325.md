abstract: "The important role that diet plays in health and disease is well established, as is its association with rising rates of obesityâ€”a phenomenon of increasing concern in Singapore. Changes in lifestyle patterns, including a movement towards a more western-style diet with an emphasis on pre-packaged and fast food, have contributed to the upward trend in weight. This study aims to test two competing approaches for calorie labelling in efforts to reduce total calories purchased. In Arm 1 (termed across category labelling) a low calorie logo will be displayed on the 20% of products on the web store that are lowest in calories per serving. Arm 2 will display this logo on the 20% of products that are lowest in calories per serving within each product category (termed within category labelling). Arm 3 is the Control condition which will not display any logo on any products. 

For our primary outcome, we hypothesize that the proportion of labelled products (or those that would have been labelled if not in control arm) purchased in each intervention arm will be greater than in control. 
 
For secondary hypotheses we expect the following ordering across the three (Control, Within category, Across category) arms:
1.     total calories (adjusted for household size):               C > A > W
2.     calories per serving:                                                    C > A > W
3.     calories per dollar spent:                                             W > A > C
4.     total dollars spent (adjusted for household size) :      W > A > C
