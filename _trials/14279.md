abstract: "How does exposure to wartime violence shape individuals' attitudes and behavior in a post-conflict society? This project employs a lab-in-the-field experiment with approximately 600 participants to explore the impact of wartime violence on the attitudes and behavior of survivors, their descendants, and non-descendants. We will randomly assign two treatments: (1) an information stimulus priming participants about herbicidal warfare during the Vietnam War, and (2) varying the recipient status in a dictator game. We will then assess the associations between these treatments and our key outcomesâ€”stated empathy toward herbicide victims and the allocation of rewards. Additionally, we will analyze the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) to quantify how direct (survivor) and indirect (descendant) exposure to wartime violence, combined with the treatments, influence individuals' attitudes and behavior."
