abstract: "This research examines how framing effects and milestone achievements change consumersâ€™ recycling behavior. We partnered with a garbage recycling company that facilitates an app, allowing us to track user behavior. The treatments are milestones and an easier to understand framing of recycling behavior, and the controls are no milestones and the default framing language."
