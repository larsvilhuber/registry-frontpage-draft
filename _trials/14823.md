abstract: "The northern region of Sweden faces a strong demand for employees across multiple industries and the Swedish government is actively trying to create incentives for unemployed individuals to relocate to these regions. The Swedish public employment service has been assigned to evaluate if vacancy referrals to job openings in the northern regions have a positive effect on the probability that unemployed individuals apply to these jobs and also to a higher degree relocate to these regions. A randomized controlled trial has been implemented where job-seekers in the treatment group are given vacancy referrals to job-openings in the northern regions. Job-seekers in the treatment group are randomly divided between vacancy referrals mandatory or only suggestive to apply for. The control-group receives treatment as usual. For this group, it is possible to get suggested vacancy referrals, but the referrals will be to job-openings in the region where the job-seeker resides and not to the northern regions. The target group for the intervention is job-seekers who have been unemployed between 4,5 and 12 months and have the qualifications necessary to apply for job-openings in the northern regions. The job-seekers are selected among those scheduled to have a follow-up meeting with a case worker at the public employment service within the coming week. To increase the efficiency of vacancy referrals, job-openings have been chosen in occupations where the labor market is significantly tighter in the northern regions compared to in the country as a whole. The primary outcomes of the study will be job-search behavior, employment outcomes and geographical and occupational mobility.   "
