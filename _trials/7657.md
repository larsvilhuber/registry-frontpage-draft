abstract: "Over a hundred countries use gender quotas in politics to increase female representation. Yet, when quotas apply only on party candidate lists, parties often strategically respond, resulting in female representation being at the lower end of what is compatible with quotas (Esteve-Volart and Bagues, 2012). This project will exploit an electoral setting in Chile where the party's ability to manipulate the fraction of women elected through candidate choice is limited by law. Using a randomized information campaign, which consists of sending letters to voters from randomly selected voting booths, I will examine whether informing voters about the law to ensure gender parity impacts voter candidate choice and partisan preferences. The aim is to use the findings to evaluate the underlying causes for female under-representation in politics."
