abstract: "This study aims at evaluating the SCAED program using a randomized controlled trial. After a decade of political unrest, to consolidate peace, the government of Cote d’Ivoire has launched several initiatives, including the SCAED programme targeting at risk youth, who do not take full advantage from the post-conflict economic recovery. Indeed, over 70% of youth aged 14-24 are neither in employment, nor enrolled in the education system, increasing therefore their vulnerability. The Civic Service of Action for Employment and Development (SCAED) was designed by the Government to implement activities for the social and economic inclusion of youth (from 16 to 35 years old) in situation of increased vulnerability through adapted training in Civic Action Centers for Development (CCAD) for their socio-economic empowerment. The main assumption we are testing is that the endowment of youth with moral values through civic education combined with labour skills development should improve their economic conditions, then their propensity to engage in undesired social behaviours should be reduced and their inclusion in the social fabric increased. Our expected primary outcomes are Protective and risk factors, time preference, social networks and monthly earnings. "
