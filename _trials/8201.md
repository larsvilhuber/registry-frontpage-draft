abstract: "We plan to test experimentally the impact of peer effects in groups. The payoff of both group members is identical and depends on their aggregated performance. Subjects are randomly assigned to groups of two and perform a real-effort task sequentially. We consider two real effort tasks, a tedious task (counting the occurrence of letters in senseless paragraphs) and an intellectually challenging task (solving Ravenâ€™s matrices).
For each of the two real effort tasks, we perform two treatments: In both treatments, we distinguish between a first mover (FM) and a second mover (SM). FMs can never misreport their actual performance. In the first treatment, SMs will be informed about the performance and sex of FMs before they perform the task. Identical to FMs, SMs cannot misreport their performance in this treatment.  In the second treatment, SMs will learn the FMs actual performance and sex only after they also performed the task. Thereafter, SMs will have the opportunity to misreport their own performance.
Our experiment extends the analysis of peer effects to situations in which the interests of group members are fully aligned. Our original hypotheses before we performed a pilot were as follows:
(i)	In the first treatment, the actual performance of SMs increases in the performance of first movers. This effect is more pronounced for the challenging task.
(ii)	In the second treatment, the reported performance of SMs (and hence their degree of misreporting) increases in the performance of first movers. This effect is more pronounced for the challenging task.
Our pilots, however, suggests that all of our hypotheses will be rejected by the data.
