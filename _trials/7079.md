abstract: "Low empathy becomes prevalent and it is associated with bad peer relationships, such as alienation and even bullying behaviors in the school. Utilizing the context of two large middle schools in urban China, we first design survey instruments to elicit students’ empathy skills, bullying tendency and depression tendency. We further design a novel psychological intervention that is cost effective to improve students’ empathy skills with their parents. The intervention mainly composes of a series of parent-child activities that are daily based. We expect a reasonable take-up rate by parents and, through improving empathy and parent-child relationship, the students become more socially desirable in the class."
