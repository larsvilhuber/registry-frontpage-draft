abstract: "Washington, DC’s low-income communities – specifically Wards 5, 7, and 8 – are on the wrong side of nearly every documented social determinant of health. Of the more than 220,000 individuals in these three wards, 108,000 rely on SNAP, nearly 40% are obese, and 35% are unemployed. Today, there is a 15-year difference in life expectancy between residents of Ward 8 and residents of Ward 3, less than 10 miles away. The top four leading causes of death in DC are now diet-related chronic illnesses. Residents of these predominantly African American neighborhoods have acutely limited access to the resources essential to daily life, including the key need for affordable, healthy food. In clinical settings, patients often cite long distances to grocery stores and limited budgets for food as barriers in taking control of their diets and health. 

Individuals that consume less expensive and more calorie-dense foods, which typically have lower nutritional value, are in a vicious cycle of hunger and over-consumption that impairs management of Type-2 diabetes, among other diet-related chronic conditions. Because obesity is a significant risk factor for chronic diseases, effective strategies for weight management are required. 

This study will conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the Produce Rx Grocery Store Model. The Produce Rx program aims to improve the nutritional status of Medicaid-enrolled adults diagnosed with at least one diet-related health condition in DC. Produce Rx specifically targets individuals who are currently experiencing or at risk for diet-related chronic diseases. This program combines vouchers for fruit and vegetables redeemable at a local supermarket with the offer of nutritional classes and an incentive for regular primary care visits.

We have designed an experiment to answer three primary research questions:
1.	Does Produce Rx increase expenditure on fruit and vegetables? 
2.	Does participation in Produce Rx improve biomarkers among individuals with prediabetes, diabetes or hypertension?
3.	Does Produce Rx decrease total health care expenditures and utilization (inpatient hospital and emergency department visits) among Medicaid managed care members? 

We also address (as secondary hypotheses) questions of healthcare utilization and participant satisfaction, which have implications for the sustainability of the program.

4.	What are the characteristics of those individuals with high voucher redemption rates versus those with lower rates? Do these differ by subgroups? 
5.	How do participants perceive the program? What barriers to participation do people report? How do they perceive food and nutrition resources in their neighborhoods and the relationship with their healthcare team compared to controls, after participation?
