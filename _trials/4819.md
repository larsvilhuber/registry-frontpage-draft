abstract: "We evaluate the effect of a randomized information intervention targeted at first-year university students to enhance their beliefs that effort is productive. Existing research suggests that students endowed with “growth mindset”, a belief that one’s intelligence and cognitive abilities are malleable so can be increased through effort, rather than fixed traits; are more likely to be academically successful. 

The objectives of this study were to understand (i) whether a light-touch information intervention can improve academic outcomes over the medium term (4-5 months later) and (ii) the mechanisms through which any such benefits occur, for example through changes in study habits. 

First year undergraduate students at one UK university were randomised with stratification by demographic characteristics, subject of study and prior educational performance to receive an invitation to a 1 hour computer laboratory session during which (unknown to them) either our intervention or a control protocol would be delivered. 1026 attended (496 control and 530 treatment). 

The intervention consisted of a video describing evidence on malleability of intelligence and suggestions on study habits to put this into practice followed by incentivised multiple choice and letter-writing tasks designed to encourage participants to engage with the information they have just received. The control group received a video and incentivised tasks of the same structure but designed to have no effect on behaviour. 

The primary outcomes of interest are students’ belief about the productivity of academic effort, their growth mindset, their first year mark (grade point average) and graduation outcome. Secondary outcomes to understand the mechanisms are lecture and class attendance, quantity of study, and study habits such as use of active learning methods, and spacing out of material on one topic. 

We will focus on Home students and investigate heterogeneity in treatment effect by socio-economic status, gender, and past academic outcome (tariff entry).
