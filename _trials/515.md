abstract: "In developing countries a large majority of small and medium firms operate in the informal sector. In Benin, this is particularly the case and the national statistics agency estimated that the informal sector represented in 2009 up to 70% of the GDP and 95% of employment. This evaluation takes advantage of the creation of a new legal status for small firms by the Government of Benin to study the impact of three different packages of formalization incentives on formalization rate and firm performances. 3,600 informal businesses operating in Cotonou have been randomly allocated into three treatment and one control groups. A first treatment group will only receive information about the new status and the fact that direct and indirect costs of formalization have been highly reduced. A second group of businesses will receive the same information plus access to business training and bank services (access to a bank account) as further incentives to formalize. On a top of that, a last treatment group will have access to tax mediation services. The evaluation goal is to answer the following research questions (i) Do firms voluntarily move into the formal sector if costs of formalization are highly reduced? (ii) What is the optimal package of incentives to increase formalization? (iii) To what extent the fear of tax administration is an important barrier to formalization? (iv) What is the effect of becoming formal on firm performance and access to credit?"
