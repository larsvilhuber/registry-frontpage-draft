abstract: "We plan to collaborate randomized controlled trials with a large private company to study the effects of future salary information on employees' desire for promotion, job satisfaction, hours of work (including overtime), output, and retention. Specifically, the company plans to randomly provide information about its future salaries, depending on its employees' age, achievements, and job rank. We further plan to investigate underlying mechanisms from administrative data and surveys collected by the company."
