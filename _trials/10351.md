abstract: "In August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a bill with historic climate provisions, through the budget reconciliation process. The IRA was the most substantial package of climate legislation in US history, and it represented a major win for the US climate movement. However, it is project to accomplish only about 65% of the remaining emissions reductions required to reach the US' nationally-determined contributions to the Paris Agreement. This experiment will test how learning about the IRA's major, but incomplete, political win for the climate movement affects motivation to continue advocating for climate policy. Alongside, the experiment will also test the impacts of linking the IRA with a fictional story about the citizen-led climate movement that led to the bill's passage. We have three primary outcomes. First, we measure participants' collective external efficacy beliefs. Second, we have two primary measures of citizen action on climate change. The first is whether participants write and take steps to a letter to Congress about climate policy, and the second is donations of potential lottery winnings to climate advocacy groups. We supplement the main experimental survey, during which we collect our primary outcomes, with an obfuscated follow-up survey with additional measures of political engagement. "
