abstract: "It is a robust finding in the literature on choice under risk that people like right-skewed, but avoid left-skewed risks (e.g., Golec and Tamarkin,1998, Sydnor, 2010, or Ebert, 2015). We conduct a laboratory experiment in order to test whether, beside this preference for absolute skewness, there is also a preference for relative skewness. By changing the correlation structure of lotteries we can manipulate how skewed these lotteries are relative to each other without affecting their absolute skewness. We thereby test for key predictions of salience theory of choice under risk (Bordalo et al., 2012) that allow us to distinguish it from cumulative prospect theory (Tversky and Kahneman, 1992)."
