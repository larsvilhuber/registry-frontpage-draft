abstract: "In order to shed light on the respective role of parents and children in making schooling decisions, our experiment will assign primary schools in Mozambique’s Manica province randomly across four groups, comprising three treatment groups and one control group. In the three treatment arms, we will introduce attendance “report cards” for each girl in Grade 6 and Grade 7, the last two grades of primary school, with the aim to record and share weekly attendance information with parents. In two of these treatment arms, transfers conditional on regular attendance will also be paid either (i) to parents, in cash or (ii) to the girls, in money-equivalent tokens redeemable against a selected number of items such as clothes, shoes and school bags made available at the school by the research team. The choice of these items was based on qualitative evidence suggesting that they were both valued by girls in the relevant target group and likely to “stick” to the child recipient, contrary to a cash transfer. We reinforce the comparability of the transfers of “cash to parents” and “in kind to daughters” by matching the value of the tokens to that of the cash transfer, and by allowing parents receiving cash to purchase the same items as the girls receiving tokens in the other treatment arm."
