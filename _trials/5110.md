abstract: "This RCT has two main goals. First, its most important objective is to assess the effectiveness of an intervention aimed at improving the reading skills of struggling third-grade students in Colombia. Students participated in remedial tutorials conducted during school hours in small groups. Trained teachers used structured pedagogical materials that can be easily scaled up. We designed the data collection so that to measure treatment effects during third grade and, to measure fade-out, in grade four (when no tutorials were offered). Second, we set out to implement this intervention with three cohorts of students and therefore we did a series of randomized experiments. The goal was to use the outcomes of each cohort to fine-tuned the intervention for each subsequent cohort."
