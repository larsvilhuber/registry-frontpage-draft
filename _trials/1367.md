abstract: "How people draw the moral circle that defines whom they include in their moral considerations, is at the heart of the most pressing policy challenges facing the world today and strongly related to the question of global fairness. Large inequalities between countries and an increasing number of migrants are pervasive features of the modern world that raise the profound question about who we are morally obligated to help. Do people perceive there to be particular moral obligations between citizens within a country and, if so, what are the constituents of these obligations? These questions are also of great importance in the climate debate, where it is essential to understand
which moral obligations people believe they have towards future generations.

The ambition of this research project is to study to what extent an important type of relationships, collaboration for mutual benefit, is seen to give rise to distributive obligations and to what extent such collaboration creates an asymmetry in the obligations that exist within and between
groups of individuals who collaborate."
