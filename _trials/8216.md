abstract: "Vaccination against infectious diseases has both private and public
benefits. We study whether social preferences---concerns for the
well-being of other people---are associated with one's decision
regarding vaccination. We measure these social preferences for 549
online subjects with a public-good game and an altruism game. To the
extent that one gets vaccinated out of concern for the health of others,
contribution in the public-good game is analogous to an individual's
decision to obtain vaccination, while our altruism game provides a
different measure of altruism, equity, and efficiency concerns. We proxy
vaccine demand with how quickly a representative individual voluntarily
took the initial vaccination for COVID-19 (after the vaccine was widely
available). We collect COVID-19 vaccination history separately from the
games to avoid experimenter-demand effects. We find a strong result:
Contribution in the public-good game is associated with greater demand
to voluntarily receive a first dose, and thus also to vaccinate earlier.
Compared to a subject who contributes nothing, one who contributes the
maximum ($4) is 58% more likely to obtain a first dose voluntarily in
the four-month period that we study (April through August 2021). In
short, people who are more pro-social are more likely to take a
voluntary COVID-19 vaccination. Behavior in our altruism game does not
predict vaccination. We recommend further research on the use of
pro-social preferences to help motivate individuals to vaccinate for
other transmissible diseases, such as the flu and HPV."
