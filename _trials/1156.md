abstract: "Place-based policy interventions have been shown to effectively reduce crime, which exhibits a high level of spatial concentration. Two such strategies are hotspots policing, which focuses on targeting police and enforcement resources on specific streets, and broken windows, which focuses on cleaning up streets to stop criminal behavior. We partnered with the Bogota Police to test these two theories in 1,919 of the most crime-ridden street segments in the city. In a 2x2 factorial design, we assign street segments to receive hotspot policing, broken windows, both or neither. Our randomization strategy takes into account the spatial clustering of hotspots, which allows us to estimate direct treatment effects and indirect spillover effects. "
