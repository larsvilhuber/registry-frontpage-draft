abstract: "This project examines the influence of reggaetón music on men’s prosocial behaviour toward women in Latin America, using the "ultimatum" game. Given that reggaetón often includes sexually explicit and objectifying lyrics, the study explores whether exposure to this music impacts how men behave in economic decisions involving women."
