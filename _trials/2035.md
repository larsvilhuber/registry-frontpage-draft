abstract: "This study provides a randomized impact evaluation of the "Grass-roots Entrepreneurship Education & Pro-Poor Enterprise Development" program that was implemented in Myanmar in 2014-2016. The training program is unique in focusing on helping participants explore new entrepreneurial opportunities in their existing business or in starting a new business. The program also takes into consideration the evidence from recent evaluations of microenterprise training programs, by providing intensive, multi-month training, making the program engaging and relevant, and incorporating elements of mentorship and customized advice. Hence the study provides evidence on the impacts of an entrepreneurship-oriented, intensive training program in a country experiencing rapid political and economic change. "
