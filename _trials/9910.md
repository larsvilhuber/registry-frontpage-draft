abstract: "Exporting provides business opportunities with high return but only the most productive companies, which are predominantly owned and managed by men, overcome the fixed costs of exporting. Exporting is particularly difficult as it requires high managerial knowledge and skills as well as the network and confidence to create international contacts, all of which female entrepreneurs tend to lack. We test an intervention that tackles these various problems at a time. Export-interested female entrepreneurs in complementary sectors receive support to establish a consortium, a legally connected group of firms, to cooperate in exporting their products abroad over two years. Simultaneously, the firms receive individual and consortia-level consultancy regarding their export strategy. The consortia provide the women with a new business network disconnected from family structures, contacts to exchange about common business challenges and strategies to succeed as a female entrepreneur in international markets as well as the legal framework to collectivize the fixed costs of exporting. At one and two years post the start of the intervention, we measure effects on women's business empowerment, network size and quality, business, management and export practices as well as their export performance."
