abstract: "The importance of entrepreneurial skills extends beyond individuals who aspire to enter the business world. With the evolving nature of most high-return jobs, there is a growing need for an entrepreneurial mindset of labor that encompasses a range of cognitive and non-cognitive skills. However, there is a lack of data and experimental evidence on whether an entrepreneurial mindset can be instilled (especially in high school students), whether the current at-scale implementation has been effective, their impact on entrepreneurial traits, and whether such skills are effective in closing the existing skill gaps across genders. To address this gap, we leverage a unique opportunity to work with the Government of Andhra Pradesh on the rollout of the Entrepreneurial Mindset Development Program (EMDP). The program consists of a special curriculum, which is delivered to Grade 9 students over 220 working days, to train students on their entrepreneurial mindset. Working closely with the Government of Andhra Pradesh and the implementing NGOs, we aim to assess the program’s impact on the students’ entrepreneurial mindset, cognitive and non-cognitive skills, their ability to prepare and deliver an entrepreneurial idea, their hypothetical choice of labor, choice of major going forward, and their intention to pursue work that is different from traditional labor (i.e. not self-employed). %The novelty of our work is that using incentivized experiments we elicit various behavioral factors often associated with entrepreneurship, to make the connection of whether such programs can behaviorally shape students from a young age.
