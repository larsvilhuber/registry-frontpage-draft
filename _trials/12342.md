abstract: "A persistent challenge with the use of large-scale safety net programs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is that the programs have limited turnover and are thus very expensive to operate. Graduation models programs are designed to address this problem through a big push approach, providing large asset transfers, financial inclusion and skills training to promote greater success against poverty reduction. With this in mind, the Government of Egypt has designed a graduation model program, called Forsa, to directly provide a mechanism to support graduation from its national safety net program; however, voluntary take-up of Forsa is limited. In this study, we seek to test the effect of targeted messages on interest in and take-up of Forsa as an alternative to the existing cash transfer program, by randomizing video messages into the end of a household survey in communities where Forsa is available."
