abstract: "In this study, we aim to understand how beliefs about other people's attitudes influence individuals’ attitudes toward coworkers' use of family-friendly policies in the workplace, such as parental leave and flexible working hours for parents, in the context of South Korea. In Korea, taking of family-friendly policies in the workplace is lower than in other countries, and previous surveys conducted by the government suggest that a major barrier to individuals' taking these policies is the lack of supportive attitudes within the workplace.

This study tries to focus on the role of social norms in shaping attitudes toward  coworkers' use of family-friendly policies. Recent studies have shown that one’s own attitudes and beliefs are strongly associated with (mis)perceptions about other’s attitudes and beliefs on the same issue (Bursztyn and Yang 2022). According to pilot surveys conducted by our team, employees in Korea tend to underestimate other employee’s support for their coworker's use of family-friendly policies in workplace, and there was a clear correlation between these beliefs about others and their own attitudes towards the policies.

Specifically, we will conduct a large-scale survey (n=2000) to explore the relationship between individuals’ beliefs about others’ support and their attitudes toward the policies. Through an information provision experiment, we will assess how providing objective information about others affects changes in beliefs and own attitudes toward policies. "
