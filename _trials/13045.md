abstract: "We investigate which accounting information is considered relevant for supply chain contracting using a discrete choice experiment in a survey of ﬁrm representatives in Germany. Prior evidence on the role of ESG information in the ﬁrm's choices of suppliers is limited to public ﬁrms. We extend and compare choices both for public and private ﬁrms. We also examine the relative importance of ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial performance in the initiation decisions. Finally, we explore the private/public company status and diﬀerent ESG communication channels as moderating factors."
