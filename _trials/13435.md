abstract: "Increasing the productivity of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is a key challenge in emerging markets. While management training for SME owners might improve firm performance, existing research shows modest impacts. In this study, we further explore the impacts of management training, with a specific focus on peer interactions among entrepreneurs during accelerator and incubator programs. We aim to investigate two questions: (1) how do peer effects among startups affect future business growth and performance? (2) what are the mechanisms behind peer effects and heterogeneity on the basis of the gender of the entrepreneur and the stage of the business? 
To answer these questions, we partner with Impact Hub Lagos to conduct a randomized controlled trial among firms participating in a business support program. These firms are either established startups participating in the acceleration program or non-established high-growth potential ventures at the idea stage participating in the incubation program. All firms will be assigned to chat groups within an online collaboration platform to stimulate peer interaction and feedback. Over two months, we will use an incentive scheme to encourage firms in the treatment group to ask and answer questions from each other regarding sales and financial management concepts covered during their programs. We will conduct two follow-up surveys at 2 months (short-term) and 12 months (long-term) after the baseline to collect data on firms' business outcomes. Furthermore, to test collaboration or competition between firms, we will run an award experiment offering a $500 prize at the end of the training. A random subset of entrepreneurs will be informed about this award. We will monitor award applications and survey responses to assess information transfer among entrepreneurs regarding the award, which helps gauge collaborative and competitive dynamics. We will also assess heterogeneity in award information sharing based on treatment status. Results from this study can provide policy-relevant guidance on supporting SMEs through peer-based business training models."
