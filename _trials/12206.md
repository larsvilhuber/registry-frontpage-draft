abstract: "Consumer surveys in rich economies reveal a positive correlation between unemployment and inflation expectations, consistent with a supply-side narrative. I explore this correlation further by (a) developing a novel experimental design that allows me to elicit the average elasticity of unemployment expectations in response to inflation expectation changes, (b) measuring how behavior in the labor market changes in response to increasing or decreasing inflation expectations caused by unspecified, supply or demand shocks and (c) measuring whether this response differs between men and women.
