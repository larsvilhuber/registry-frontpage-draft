abstract: "Risk taking on behalf of others is common in many decisions and has been the focus of recent research in economics, finance and psychology. Majority of the previous research involving experiments did not provide any information to the decision makers about those on whose behalf they make decisions. More recent studies focused on the effect of social distance (i.e., making decisions for oneself, a friend, or a stranger) on risk preferences (see, e.g., Montinari and Rancan, 2018; Batteux, Ferguson and Tunney, 2017; Zhang et al., 2017). Different from these, the current study aims to test the effect of needs of other people on risk attitudes and their degree of loss aversion when making risky decisions on behalf of others. For that purpose, we will randomly assign clients to decision makers either from an African country that is characterized by poverty or from a Western country that is characterized by prosperity. More precisely, in our study, participants from the US, who are going to be recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk, will make risky decisions for either themselves (control group), a person from England (treatment 1), or a person from the Gambia (treatment 2). Participants in the role of decision makers will be informed about the nationality of their clients."
