abstract: "This study will measure demand for public transport in Lagos. 

The first study consists of a field experiment to measure participants value of wait time. The experiment hinges around an SMS-based app (playable on all cellphones)  in which participants arrive at a bus stop and are offered a payment amount to wait for a number of minutes before boarding their bus. Enumerators stationed at the bus stops have a tablet which displays a secret code that changes each minute; participants text these codes to our shortwhen they arrive to register their arrival time and receive their offer. If they accept the offer, they send the code displayed after the specified amount of time has elapsed to verify they waited. We randomize the offers of payments and waits; participants' decisions to accept or reject the offers reveal their value of wait time.

The second study consists of a field experiment that measures the price elasticity of demand for transport services. In collaboration with the transit regulator in Lagos, we have developed a way in which price subsidies can be administered via the swipe cards used to the pay for the formal bus system in Lagos."
