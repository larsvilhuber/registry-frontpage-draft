abstract: "The role of stereotypes in the cognitive process of individuals and its potential effect on decisions and behaviors has been confirmed in various disciplines, from psychology to social sciences. A sensitive area in which gender stereotypes can play an important role is the one relating to mental health. The stigma associated with diseases such as, for example, depression affects men and women differently and this could lead the two groups to behave differently in reporting the disease. This project studies the effect of eliciting gender stereotypes on how mental issues are reported."
