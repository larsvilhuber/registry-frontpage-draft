abstract: "In addition to chronic poverty, many rural households in developing countries face seasonal changes in living standards with acute periods of 'seasonal poverty' throughout the year. The most well-documented causes of seasonal poverty are tied to seasonality in agricultural production. This study evaluates a program aimed at alleviating seasonal poverty in a setting with another potentially large driver of seasonality: variation in the timing of remittance income. The data comes from a sample of rural households in the western plains of Nepal, where the majority of households engage in temporary migration within Nepal or to India, and remittances make up a substantial fraction of rural incomes. In partnership with a local NGO, we offer interest-free loans to farming and migrating households during the agricultural ‘lean season’, to be repaid after the harvest. Our experiment randomly varies access to this seasonal loan program both at the village level and at the household level within villages."
