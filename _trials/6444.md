abstract: "We randomize different survey formats (Likert, Slider) to understand how the survey format affects the estimation of continuous latent variables, such as attitude and perception. One half of survey participants will respond to a questionnaire using Likert scale and another half will respond to a questionnaire using Slider. Using survey responses from two different formats, we will estimate the nonparametric densities of latent variables and will discuss which survey method can provide responses that are more aligned with standard identification assumptions in the measurement error literature.
