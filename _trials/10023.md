abstract: "This paper studies  social spillover effects in distributive decision making. In an online spectator experiment, subjects choose from a menu of alternative ways to distribute money between strangers. In a US sample, constructed to be representative of the general population with respect to age, sex and ethnicity, we test whether receiving information about the choices of a reference group influences the spectator’s decision in the current experimental setting. The reference group is a randomly drawn group of three other spectators from a previous experiment by Almås et al. (2020). Prior to treatment, we elicit subjects’ beliefs choices in the reference group."
