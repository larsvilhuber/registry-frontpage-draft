abstract: "This document constitutes a pre-analysis plan for an experiment to be conducted in the field in India, starting in late July/early August 2017. Comparison samples are to be obtained with students in Oxford, and budget allowing, with students in Pune, India. While we tried to present a complete discussion, some of the hypotheses remain less elaborate than we had hoped for. This is due on the one hand to time pressures coming from project funding, which did not allow us to further delay the experiments. We thus had to leave this plan incomplete in order to be able to submit before seeing any signifiant amounts of data coming out of the experiment. On the other hand, this same time pressure did not allow us to fully develop our econometric approach, so that some hypotheses are formulated only verbally, but do not yet have a more precise mathematical formulation."
