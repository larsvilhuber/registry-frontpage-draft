abstract: "We conduct an experiment where a random subset of the participants in the Bundesbank's household panel receive personalized response scales, centered at each respondent's point forecast. Personalized scales mitigate the impact of central tendency bias and eliminate the need to adjust the scale when inflation falls outside the range for which the scale was designed."
