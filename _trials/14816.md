abstract: "Hypothetical bias (HB) stands as a major drawback in the literature using discrete choice experiments (DCEs) to estimate consumer preferences and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for market goods and attributes. While a fully incentivized DCE - where one choice set is randomly selected as binding and the subject's choice in that choice set is implemented for real purchase and payment - overcomes the issue with HB, this approach is significantly limited by several logistical hurdles. First, many DCE studies are interested in learning about consumer preferences for products that don't yet exist on the market, rendering a fully incentivized DCE infeasible. Second, even if all products are available, DCEs usually involve multiple choice sets with multiple alternatives each, which would require the researcher to go through the cumbersome task of obtaining a large number of product alternatives to have available for implementing the real purchase. In this light, hybrid DCE approaches, where some of the choice sets are real and others are hypothetical, offer a promising alternatives to mitigate HB while at the same time addressing potential infeasibility and logistical challenges of the fully incentivized DCE. This study aims at examining different hybrid DCE designs that vary the hypothetical portion of the DCE across choice sets vs. alternatives within choice sets, while also exogenously varying the information disclosure between full vs. ambiguous. We compare the different hybrid DCE designs to a hypothetical DCE and a fully incentive compatible DCE to determine their relative effectiveness in addressing HB. Our results can provide useful insights and guidance to researchers on how to mitigate HB in DCEs while keeping costs manageable and maintaining feasibility of their study designs. "
