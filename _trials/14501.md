abstract: "Collective action problems pose significant barriers to addressing environmental problems in developing countries. In this project, we explore potential solutions to these challenges within the context of a rural area in a developing country. Our experiments compare the standard education approach which disseminates information about the environmental problem with three novel interventions. The first equips participants with a tailored set of tools aimed at enhancing cooperation and social capital within the community and thereby facilitating collective action. The second treatment adds a means for the community to monitor the environmental problem in public spaces. In the final variant, we provide additional information that enables the community to better understand their own exposure to the environmental issue. We also measure the impact on spillover farmers. We assess outcomes using metrics measuring changes in the environmental problem, production and cooperation within the community."
