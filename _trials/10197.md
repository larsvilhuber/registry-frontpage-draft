abstract: "Skilled Managers – Productive Workplaces (SMPW) is an ESRC-funded study, awarded under the Transforming Productivity, Management Practices and Employee Engagement call. SMPW focuses on the evaluation of impacts from an online training intervention that provides managers with the skills they need to handle complex and difficult workplace issues; exploring how the training intervention changes managers’ practice, the quality of their relationships with staff, and evaluating whether this translates into improved performance. The project will contribute important causal evidence on the role that management practice and capability play in the UK’s productivity challenge.

The project engages with a variety of UK-based organisations expressing interest in the research, to implement a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) that randomly allocates all managers in distinct workplace units to receive an online training ‘treatment’ and other units to a ‘business as usual’ control.
