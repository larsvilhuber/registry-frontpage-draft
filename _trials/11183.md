abstract: "Thousands of randomly generated fictitious resumes will be sent in response to online job postings in a selection of US cities. A matched pair of resumes will be sent to each job posting, where resumes are similar except for a characteristic of interest: pronoun disclosure. To investigate hiring discrimination against nonbinary applicants, employer response rates will be compared for resumes which disclose "they/them" pronouns (signals the applicant is nonbinary), disclose binary pronouns congruent with sex implied by name (contains political and other signals associated with pronoun disclosure in general), and do not disclose pronouns (control group). Multiple hypotheses will be explored, including whether discrimination varies by geographic politics; sex implied by name; the extent to which the occupation is customer-facing; female-dominated, male-dominated, and non-dominated occupations; and years of relevant work experience."
