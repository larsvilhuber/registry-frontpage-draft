abstract: "In empirical development economics, it is customary to collect data via face to face household surveys. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors have encouraged a shift to phone surveys for this work, where the research literature on mobile phone surveys in low- and middle-income countries is thin. Much of the literature is also out of date, given the rapid changes in mobile cell phone penetration even among poor households as digital financial tools are used more and more for social protection interventions.

In this study, IPA takes advantage of phone surveys launched in nine countries to embed experiments on the best times and days to initiate phone surveys and the optimal number of attempts for high response rates data quality. We use random digit dial surveys, for which it is automatic to randomly assign cases (initial attempts) to time of day and day of week. By definition, most other variables in call protocols are also randomized because cases (phone numbers to attempt) are dialed in random order."
