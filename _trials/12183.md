abstract: "Tax incentives can encourage charitable giving, potentially benefiting both society and taxpayers. Some research has shown that image concerns affect donation decisions, so this paper introduces an experimental approach to directly test whether donation behavior can be influenced by image concern. 
Specifically, we will test two hypotheses: 1) How the donation behavior changes when image concern is involved in an environment where the income and benefits of donating are unequal. 2) the interrelationship between unequal social position, image concern, and the impact of reporting costs on the use of rebates. To achieve this goal, we devised a total of 2x2 treatment groups based on whether image concern was considered and whether opt-in was introduced. We will be testing this in a laboratory setting at Kansai University in Japan with approximately 200 to 300 university students. In this experiment, we will examine how subjects respond to different refund rates for donations with different image concerns and opt-in.
