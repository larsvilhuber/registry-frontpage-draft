abstract: "Languages with a strong future-time reference (FTR) require speakers to grammatically mark future events (e.g. in English with “will” or “going to”), while others with a weak FTR do not (e.g. German). Previous research suggests that strong FTR languages make the future feel more distant than the present, implying that more short-term-oriented behavior occurs in areas such as saving and health. The aim of this research project is to examine the effect of the linguistic structure on individual pro-environmental behavior (PEB). In a between-subject online experiment, we will randomize the instructional language of the incentivized, environmental decision task among bilingual people who are fluent in the strong FTR language English and the weak FTR language German. We will elicit subjects’ pro-environmental behavior using a new incentivized decision task. This approach allows us to investigate whether there is a causal effect of a language’s FTR on individual PEB. "
