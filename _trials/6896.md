abstract: "This project uses a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of applying nudges in the context of ticket resolution within a multinational software corporation. Several tools have been introduced to automate key steps in the process of solving customer cases, however, many suffer from low adoption. The present study aims to investigate the potential for nudges (in the form of notifications about the availability of a diagnostic report) to increase the adoption of a specific diagnostic tool designed to process customer log files. We analyze both the immediate effects and persistence in behavior following the deactivation of the nudge. Approximately 900 employees will be randomly assigned to one of three groups, comprising one control and two treatment groups (N1 receives notifications for the entire 12-week duration of the study, N2 ceases to receive the nudge after 6 weeks of the study to assess long-term effects. A control group B receives no notifications)."
