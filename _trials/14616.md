abstract: "Children spend most of their time at home in their early years, yet efforts to promote human capital at home in many low- and middle-income settings remain limited. We conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate an intervention which encourages parents and caregivers to
foster human capital accumulation among their children between ages 3 and 5, with a focus on math and phonics skills."
