abstract: "Strengthening the enforcement and collection of property tax has become a key priority for the Government of Tamil Nadu, India. This study aims to test whether outsourcing property assessments to third-party firms is a cost-effective way to increase property tax revenues for the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) and to determine the optimal contract for incentivizing third-party firms to complete assessments correctly and efficiently. 

The GCC (municipal corporation for the capital city of Tamil Nadu) implemented a census of all properties between 2018-2022 and identified 250,000 properties that are under-valued or un-assessed and need to be re-assessed. We will implement a randomized evaluation comparing two different contracts for outsourcing the re-assessment of these properties to third-party firms: a fixed fee contract and a hybrid contract (fixed fee plus performance bonus). Additionally, we will compare the performance of third-party firms to tax assessors currently employed by the GCC, to measure the performance of outsourcing relative to in-sourcing. The interventions proposed in this study have the potential to raise property tax revenues for the GCC without imposing additional burdens on existing tax assessors and collectors.
