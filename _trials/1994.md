abstract: "We will recruit survey participants on MTurk to conduct an online survey. With this survey, we plan to study whether the legitimacy (in the sense of conformity to the law) of a certain political view also affects its social desirability.
First, all subjects will answer a few demographic questions. Second, they will be randomized into three groups. Subjects in the control group will receive no information. Subjects in the "popular" treatment group will be told that a large proportion of survey respondents support an anti-Muslim policy. Subjects in the "unconstitutional" treatment group will also be told that this anti-Muslim policy is unconstitutional. Third, we will measure their beliefs about the popularity of the anti-Muslim policy. Given the tone of the current political discourse, the "popular" treatment might not change our subjects' beliefs about the popularity of the anti-Muslim policy. However, it is important to test that these beliefs are not affected by the "unconstitutional treatment". Fourth, we will measure subjects willingness to donate money to an anti-Muslim organization promoting the policy. In particular, we will offer them a $1 compensation if they agree on allowing us to donate $1 to the anti-Muslim organization of their behalf. Customers will be randomized into two groups: in one group we will emphasize that their decision is private; in the other group we will tell subjects that "a member of the research team might personally contact you to verify your answers", thus making the decision to be perceived as public. We will test our hypothesis by comparing the donation decisions of subjects in the six (3x2) experimental groups. Again, given the election results our subjects might already believe that a vast proportion of citizens support anti-Muslim policies. If this is the case, there might not exist a wedge between public and private donation rates in the control group which the "popular" treatment could reduce. Since what we are particularly interested in is whether the "unconstitutional" treatment increase the wedge by diminishing the perceived social desirability of supporting anti-Muslim policies, it is still important to have the "popular" treatment group to control for the effect of popular support."
