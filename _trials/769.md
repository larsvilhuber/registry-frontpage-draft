abstract: "The ambition of this project is to evaluate the impact of an inclusive microfinance program called 'We can manage!', targeting disabled people, and women in particular, in rural Uganda. The project aims at measuring impact on entrepreneurship, confidence, preferences, social attitudes, locus of control, family living conditions including school outcomes for the children, well-being and happiness. 

The idea behind the program is to reduce financial barriers and build capacity and confidence among the participants in the microfinance program, and to reduce prejudice in society by demonstrating the ability of women and disabled to manage and mobilize resources. 

Key questions of our research are: Does the 'We can manage!' program improve the livelihoods of the participants in these groups, and in particular the disabled and their families? Does it make them more confident? Does it reduce prejudice in society? Clearly, if the program has a positive impact on these (or related) dimensions, it will have improved the situation for perhaps the most vulnerable group in society: the disabled (females) in the rural area of a poor country.
