abstract: "In this project, we investigate whether ingroup favoritism among children can be driven by guilt-aversion (Battigalli and Dufwenberg, 2007). A guilt-averse individual avoids disappointing others’ expectations. In a group context, if the decision-maker (DM) believes that ingroup members expect more pro-sociality from him than outgroup members, then the DM will discriminate in favor of ingroup members to fulfill their expectations (but not necessarily because he prefers them or because he believes it will lead to further benefit from him). Guth et al. (2009) were the first to show that guilt-aversion might be a driver of ingroup favoritism in adults (later replicated by Guala et al., 2013, and by Ockenfels and Werner, 2014).
The current project is inspired by the design of Ockenfels and Werner (2014). We intend to provide further evidence on the role of second-order beliefs in ingroup favoritism. However, our main contribution is derived from our non-traditional participants pool which is composed of school children from age 7 to 11 years old (in France). Previous research with children has often shown that ingroup favoritism increases with age (e.g., Aboud, 2003, Fehr, 2008; Guroglu et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2016). If our account on the role of guilt aversion is relevant, findings should reveal that ingroup bias is linked to the development of understanding of second-order beliefs and of social perspective-taking more generally. To test this hypothesis, we measure– not only donation behaviors – but also beliefs and theory-of-mind skills. "
