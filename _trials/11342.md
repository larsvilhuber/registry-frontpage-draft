abstract: "Discrete choice experiments (surveys) are commonly used in economics, marketing, transportation and other disciplines to understand the preferences that people have for various goods and services. This research seeks to gain a better understanding of whether and how choices and preference information vary according to the design of the choice experiment. The particular focus is on the sensitivity of choices to the number of available choice options in a choice question (two or three), and the number of choice questions included in the survey (one versus many)."
