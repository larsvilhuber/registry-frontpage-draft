abstract: "Economists differ in their views on how minimum wage legislation affect labor markets, but often neglect the behavioral responses of workers in this debate. Arguably, workers may reciprocate higher labor costs for the employer by putting in higher efforts, which could explain why minimum wages are not necessarily detrimental for firms. According to research on gift-exchange at the workplace, the prerequisite for such reciprocal behavior is the voluntariness underlying a wage hike. Do workers reciprocate a wage increase that does not exclusively follow the intent of the employer? 
In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive investigation into the behavioral effects of minimum wages at the individual level and outside the laboratory. In study 1, a set of coincidental events surrounding a research project at a university allow us to credibly manipulate information on motives behind a substantial pay increase. Using data on workersâ€™ effort levels and perceptions of the employer, we test the idea of gift-exchange in a context in which workers learn about lacking voluntariness behind their pay increase. In study 2, we inspect the generalizability of our findings by running a controlled survey experiment with hypothetical company settings. We analyze worker behavior when receiving a pay increase due to minimum wage policies, compared to a voluntary pay increase and compared to a baseline with no pay increase."
