abstract: "The New York City public school system is the largest in the United States, with over 1,200 schools and more than 1.1 million students enrolled each year. For more than a decade, it has also been the site of an unprecedented investment in high school reform. Beginning in 2002 and with the support of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and other philanthropies, the New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) closed many large, comprehensive high schools with a history of low performance and created hundreds of new small secondary schools. At the same time, the NYCDOE instituted a centralized high school admissions process for matching incoming ninth-grade students to the over 400 high school options available to them.

The small-school movement has been a national one. And while nearly every major American urban district has undertaken efforts to create new small schools or to transform large schools into campuses of small learning communities, there has been little rigorous evidence about the effectiveness of small schools.

New York City uses a lottery-like system to assign students when the high schools they choose are oversubscribed. MDRC has been able to take advantage of that system to develop an unusually large and rigorous study of the impact of these small high schools on students’ academic achievement, high school graduation, and progression into college. The project’s reports and policy briefs provide rigorous evidence that new small public high schools are narrowing the educational attainment gap and markedly improve graduation prospects, particularly for disadvantaged students."
