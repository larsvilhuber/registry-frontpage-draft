abstract: "Vulnerable neighborhoods in Latin American cities present a large shortage of green areas and adequate public space for community life. The lack of green areas and well-maintained public space is frequently correlated with crime, poverty and insecurity, arguably leading residents to a vicious cycle of social inactivity and withdrawal into private sphere. Increasingly aware of these problems, expanding access to green space and improving the quality of public space in vulnerable areas are currently policy priorities in the social agenda of many middle income countries, particularly in Latin America.

This study exploits a pair matching RCT design to assess the impact of a community-based urban park construction intervention implemented by Fundaci√≥n Mi Parque in vulnerable sectors of Santiago de Chile on individual and social outcomes including social capital, crime, health, environmental preferences, family relations and use of time.
