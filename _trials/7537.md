abstract: "In developing markets facing information and search frictions, how do agents access price information, update their beliefs about market conditions, and make pricing and other strategic choices? Also in such environments, what are the extent to which individual agents' access to information and their choices generate spillovers to other market participants? We explore these questions via a randomized control trial on a major online listing platform for used vehicles in Pakistan, where, along with other developing economies, increasing shares of transactions are shifting to online and mobile platforms. In our intervention we will provide estimates of transaction prices to sellers on a listing platform for used vehicles in Pakistan from February to April, 2022. We vary treatment saturation at the market-segment level by a two-stage randomization design so as to capture both direct and spillover effects. We measure the effect of providing private price information to sellers on their choices and outcomes, and capture spillover effects on competing sellers. In our primary analysis, we will detect direct and spillover effects on a) changes to the listing price, b) occurrence of transaction, c) transaction price, d) usage of advertising tools, and e) index of buyer attention. In our secondary analysis, we will identify ways in which the intervention interacts with, or in turn affects, market efficiency and structure."
