abstract: "Air pollution exposure has been shown to have wide-ranging negative consequences, not just for individualsâ€™ health and well-being, but also for their cognitive ability, productivity, and even stress and aggression. Our experiment will explore whether these effects extend to negatively impact participation, collaboration, and feedback in a workplace setting. To ensure obfuscation of the research design during implementation, further details are provided in the attached pre-analysis plan which will remain private until the field experiment is complete. "
