abstract: "Recent research has highlighted unequal treatment for women in academic economics along several different dimensions: promotion, hiring, credit for co-authorship, and standards for publication in professional journals. Can the source of these differences lie in biases against women that are pervasive in the discipline, even among students in the earliest stages of their training? In this trial, we investigate the importance of explicit and implicit biases against women among students in economics relative to other fields. We conduct a large scale survey among undergraduate students in Chilean universities, among both entering first-year students and students in years 2 and above. The survey elicits measures of implicit bias, explicit bias, and gender attitudes. The goal of the study is: a) to see whether economics students are more biased relative to students in other disciplines; b) to study whether any such differences are already present upon entry (a selection effect) or develop as students are exposed to economics training (a treatment effect). We also plan to investigate the role of political preferences, religiosity and exposure to female peers and faculty to explain the differences between economics students and students in other fields.
