abstract: "We conduct a dice roll experiment over nine countries, with representative sample of 32,400 subjects. The experiment uses the online panel provided by the SurveyMonkey. Our main focus is three folds. First, we provide large scale evidence of lying behavior in the standard dice roll experiment. Second, we test whether lying behavior is affected if the outcome is determined by luck. Third, the self-selection into different lying environments is also investigated."
