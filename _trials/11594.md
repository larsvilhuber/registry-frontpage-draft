abstract: "Adoption of profitable technologies in developing countries is notoriously low. In this project, we study the extent to which (A) experience and (B) complementarity with other technologies can improve take-up and benefits from a novel risk coping technology: long-range forecasts of the onset of the Indian summer monsoon. We use a cluster-randomized trial to experimentally test (1) whether demand for, and subsequent behavior change in response to, a forecast is stronger if a household is receiving a forecast for the second year in a row as compared with a household receiving the forecast for the first time; (2) whether demand for index insurance is stronger if the purchasing household will also receive a forecast; and (3) whether farmers respond to these products as complements or substitute."
