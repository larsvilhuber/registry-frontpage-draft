abstract: "Information frictions between actors along agricultural value chains can lead to market inefficiencies negatively affecting farmers' well-being. In the Ugandan dairy sector, farmers rely on transporters to sell their daily milk production to the local cooperative, with minimal visibility of the volumes delivered and recorded at the cooperative. Our goal is to study how farmers and transporters adjust their behavior when the informational advantages of transporters are eliminated through the introduction of digital receipts, which provide farmers with a daily breakdown of the milk volumes delivered.
