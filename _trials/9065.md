abstract: "This study is the first empirical research exploring the behavioral aspects of poverty in Saudi Arabia. For this purpose we conducted a lab-in-the field experiment, based on Tanaka et al. (2010), to measure risk and time preferences among Saudi nationals living in the poor neighborhoods of Dammam. In addition, participants completed a detailed survey to measure their socioeconomic characteristics. The natural variation in household characteristics served as control conditions in the study. In total, 166 respondents took part in both the household survey and the lab-in-the-field experiment."
