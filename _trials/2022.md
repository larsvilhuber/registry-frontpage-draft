abstract: "If a decision-maker receives good advice they should probably take it. The remuneration of the advisor, when that remuneration does not relate in any way to the probability that the advice is good should not matter. However, it may be the case that people do indeed ignore good advice because of advisor remuneration. Through a series of experiments, we wish to explore the behavioral factors that may lie behind such deviations from rationality."
