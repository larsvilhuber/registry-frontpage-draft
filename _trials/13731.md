abstract: "In this project, we aim to investigate the size of the race gap within the Colombian Public Employment Services (PES) focusing on the role of firms and their relationship with job centers. We mix administrative sources and direct surveys to measure firms' and job counselors' de facto, explicit, and implicit bias within the employment center against afro-descendant job seekers. In addition, we will test how information about firms’ unconscious bias toward afro-descendant job seekers could affect firms hiring behavior. We will also test how information about firms’ beliefs and expectations about afro-descendants could change job counselors’ referral behavior.
