abstract: "During the COVID-19 pandemic, many consumers rushed to supermarkets and pharmacies to stockpile masks, toilet papers, foods, etc. This resulted in panic buying in many places of the world. In this research, we study the causal impacts of interventions which will provide information about optimal stockpiling to randomly assigned individuals. Collaborating with Consumer Affairs Agency, Government of Japan and Tokushima Consumers' Co-operative Society, we aim to study whether and how people change their perception/behavior on stockpiling in the midst of pandemic."
