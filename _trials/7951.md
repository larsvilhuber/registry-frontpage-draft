abstract: "The primary goal of this project is to evaluate the extent to which supply side and demand side interventions are complementary or substitutable in the context of farm mechanization. To do so, we implement a randomised controlled trial with four treatment conditions: 1) control arm; 2) demand side subsidy; 3) supply side service provider bundled intervention; and 4) the combination of both the supply side service provider intervention as well as demand side subsidy.  The bundled supply-side intervention includes both a loan component and maintenance support services, and is randomised at the provider-level, while demand-side interventions are randomised at the household-level within kebeles in which the selected providers operate. 

We will examine the impact of these interventions on a range of outcomes. On the farmer side: to begin we will measure the differential impact of the three interventions on the adoption of small mechanisation services. Assuming adoption, we will then examine the impact on labour outcomes. Throughout we intend to examine the disaggregated impacts on men and women, and youth. On the service provider side: we will examine the impact on service diversification, firm seasonality, and firm revenues.
