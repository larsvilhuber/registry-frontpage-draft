abstract: "Learning the local language is often recommended to foreigners to socially integrate into a new country. We study the extent to which acquiring the local language creates social opportunities for foreigners. Using a field experiment, we investigate the relationship between cultural assimilation via learning the local language and non-native individualsâ€™ ability to socially integrate along two dimensions: (1) housing, and (2) amateur football clubs. We use online messages to contact landlords/realtors to view a property and ask football coaches to join a trial practice. We compare response rates across different email treatments.
