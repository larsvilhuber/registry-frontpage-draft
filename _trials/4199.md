abstract: "We investigate whether mindfulness meditation may affect social behavior. Among subjects at a university who indicated that they are interested in participating in a meditation course it is randomly determined who gets a place in the course and who does not. The course consists of eight weekly group sessions with an experienced meditation teacher and daily individual exercises. Pre and post intervention information from incentivized trust games will be used to investigate whether meditation increases trust and altruism. Data from pre and post intervention questionnaires and administrative records allow us to additionally investigate channels (cognitive and non-cognitive skills, stress, mindfulness and mental health) through which the intervention may affect social behavior.
