abstract: "Before firms can hire workers from a pool of applicants, they must attract the right candidates to apply for the job in the first place. On the worker’s side, applying for a job takes time and effort, and (in states where this is legal) sometimes even costs money. While these costs are guaranteed, the desired outcome of an application (a job offer) is usually not; so workers must weigh the real, present cost against the expected future benefit of applying. This project frames applying for a job as a type of investment, and studies how the factors that influence a person’s investment decisions might also affect the decision to apply for a job. We test whether changing the cost of applying for a job affects who decides to apply."
