abstract: "Existing research findings have shown that voluntary social distancing is a vital element of containing the spread of the coronavirus. When countries start to gradually relax lock-down measures, it is important for the policy makers to consider that individualsâ€™ voluntary social distancing would be beneficial for the society. However, when lock-downs are relaxed there are strong signals which may work against voluntary social distancing. The relaxation of measures may send out a public signal for less alertness, which may also lead to declining compliance to the governmental guidelines. With such policy conundrum, is it possible to promote social distancing by nudging people to deliberate on the consequences of behaviors? This study investigates the effect of a deliberation-prompting intervention in encouraging voluntary social distancing. A randomized experiment will be conducted among the general public in the UK, comparing the deliberation-prompting intervention with a standard information message intervention, as well with a control group with no intervention.
