abstract: "Recent evidence from a multi-country study (Banerjee et al. 2015 ) and from Bangladesh (Bandiera et al. 2017 ) suggests that a multifaceted program implemented by BRAC under a graduation model can lead to consistent and lasting impacts on consumption, food security, assets ownership, household income, and revenues. This study adapts BRACâ€™s approach in a multidimensional project focused this time on child nutrition, household food security, and resilience, and evaluates its impact in the Boucle du Mouhoun and the East regions of Burkina Faso. This cluster randomized-control trial seeks to assess the independent contributions of assets and nutrition interventions, potential spill-over of such policy on the other individuals in the village and the cost-effectiveness of such policies in the long-run. An HEA study was carried out in 85 villages of each region to select households within the ultra-poor category or that have a breastfeeding/pregnant/malnourished child under 5 years old. These villages were randomly attributed to one of the three treatment branches (21 per branch) and within these villages, selected households were randomly chosen to receive treatment (450 per branch) and will obtain an unconditional cash transfer (T1), a cash transfer and asset (T2), or cash transfer, an asset plus nutrition assistant (T3). A Baseline survey took place between April and June of 2018. Two follow-up surveys will be conducted in January 2019 and 2020."
