abstract: "Peer pressure can have positive impacts on individuals. While the imitation of observable peer behavior – known as passive peer pressure – has been studied extensively, active peer pressure has barely received any attention. We consider an economic framework for active peer pressure in which agents receive rewards for following desirable behavior (positive peer pressure) or receive punishments for following undesirable behavior (negative peer pressure) by their peers. We test this model in the context of a loan collection company in the field to improve our understanding of active peer pressure on the desirable behavior of loan repayment. A quantile response model assists us in understanding the mechanisms of active peer pressure by providing parameters over beliefs and actions of agents in this peer pressure environment. "
