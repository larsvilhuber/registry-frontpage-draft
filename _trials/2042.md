abstract: "The Self-Sufficiency Project (SSP) was a research and demonstration project designed to test a policy innovation that makes work pay better than welfare. Conceived and funded by Human Resources Development Canada (HRDC), managed by the Social Research and Demonstration Corporation (SRDC), and evaluated by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation (MDRC) and SRDC, SSP offered a temporary earnings supplement to selected long-term income assistance (IA) recipients in British Columbia and New Brunswick. The earnings supplement was a monthly cash payment available to single parents who had been on income assistance for at least one year and who left income assistance for full-time work. The supplement was paid on top of earnings from employment for up to three years, as long as the person continued to work full time and remained off income assistance. While collecting the supplement, the single parent received an immediate payoff from work; for a person working full time at the minimum wage, total income before taxes was about twice her earnings.

To measure the effects of its financial incentive, SSP was designed as a social experiment using a rigorous, random assignment research design. A group of about 6,000 single parents in British Columbia and New Brunswick who had been on income assistance for at least a year was selected at random from the IA rolls. One half of these people were randomly assigned to a program group and offered the SSP supplement, while the remainder formed a control group.

The key questions are whether the SSP program increased parentsâ€™ earnings and income, whether it reduced reliance on welfare, whether it harmed or benefited children, how much it cost, and whether the supplement offer had ongoing effects in the period after parents were no longer eligible to receive it."
