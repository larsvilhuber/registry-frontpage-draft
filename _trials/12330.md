abstract: "We aim to understand what motivates the willingness to intervene in the case of voluntary contribution to environmental protection projects in China. There are two options offered: (i) a payment of 18 CNY (equivalently 2.5 USD), or (ii) a payment of 12 CNY (1.6 USD) and a donation of 10 CNY (1.4 USD) to projects working on carbon reductions. Our randomization follows a 2x2x2 design on 3 domains: (i) reasons for low efforts for environmental protection, internal (low preference for environmental protection) or external (low knowledge of carbon projects), (ii) a soft (giving suggestions only) or hard (forbidding one choice) intervention, and (iii) a real impact on another Chinese or German citizen.
