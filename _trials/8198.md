abstract: "The goal of the study is to investigate the behaviour of corporate firms in Latvia and examine various approaches to increase the tax compliance. The interventions of the study examines two competing theoretical explanations what motivates to pay taxes. One is the so-called deterrence approach, stemming from the standard model of tax evasion. It predicts that tax compliance is based on tax rate, audit probability, penalty rate and income. Alternatively, non-deterrence approach states that tax compliance is based on broader propositions, such as morality, social norms and willingness to contribute to the public good. The field experiment examines both approaches on tax compliance behavior in Latvia. The study consists of seven different messages randomly assigned and sent to firms for whom the average salary in the first half of 2021 has been lower than 70% in comparison to the region and sector in which the firm is operating."
