abstract: "This research program explores two main questions: (i) Does providing information on incumbent performance to centralized political parties influence candidate selection? and (ii) Do structured debates provide credible information to voters about candidatesâ€™ competencies, and if so, does this improve voting returns for better qualified candidates in the short run and public sector performance in the long run?  In order to answer these questions, we are working with local partners to execute a series of initiatives during the 2012 Parliamentary and local government elections in Sierra Leone: i) a nonpartisan incumbent performance evaluation campaign; ii) structured, inter-party debates between candidates; and iii) several individual-level treatment arms that unpack the different types of information delivered by the debates.  We will use exit polls and official electoral data to assess the impact of these programs on candidate selection, and voter knowledge, engagement and behavior. "
