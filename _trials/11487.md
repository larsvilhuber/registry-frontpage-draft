abstract: "The Innovation Growth Lab and the Centre for Collective Intelligence Design at Nesta are conducting an online survey of European citizensâ€™ attitudes to social challenges and their willingness to participate in activities aimed at addressing these challenges. The survey will be carried out with 4800 citizens in six countries of the European Union, on behalf of the European Commission. In the course of the survey, 13 randomised experiments will be used to test 13 hypotheses about how the importance they place on social challenges, their willingness to participate in activities aimed at addressing those challenges, and their attitudes to experimentation are affected by adjusting the framing of the questions or the details of the proposed activities."
