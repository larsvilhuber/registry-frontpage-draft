abstract: "Radio programming has the potential to inform citizens of the value of public health services as well as inform and motivate supply-side improvements. Moreover, by generating expectations of receiving high-quality services as well as enabling and incentivizing bureaucrats to meet elevated uptake, these demand- and supply-side forces may be complements. Crossing demand- and supply-side interventions, this field experiment evaluates whether local radio journalists can increase utilization of higher quality health services across non-urban Tanzania. The demand-side intervention leverages an entertaining drama series and locally-tailored content to combat misperceptions about health issues and model service uptake behaviors. The supply-side intervention involves journalists conducting investigations to inform district bureaucrats about facility-level service delivery challenges, before returning to report on improvements (or lack thereof) in service delivery. Partnering with Tanzaniaâ€™s National Institute of Medical Research, we draw on citizen and bureaucrat surveys, unannounced health facility audits, and administrative data to evaluate the effect of these two interventions, several key subcomponents of each, and their interaction on health service utilization, service quality, and citizen health outcomes. The results will illuminate the extent to which and the mechanisms through which local journalism can increase demand for critical services and hold local government accountable in a developing context with limited electoral pressures and media freedoms."
