abstract: "In order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, it is important to find infected people at an early stage as well as encourage people to take preventive actions and social distancing. Contact tracing apps play the role, but voluntary installation is slow. In February 2021, the installation rate in Japan is still about 20%. In this project, we will investigate which kind of nudge-based messages will promote peopleâ€™s installation. In Study 1, we conduct one online survey experiment toward people who do not refrain from going out. We investigate which nudge-based message is effective for such the people who are not cooperative in preventing the spread of infection. In Study 2, we conduct another online survey experiment toward people, the web search behavior of whom can be traced by a research company. We investigate which nudge-based message draws their interest to contact tracing apps and led to their installation. In both Studies 1 and 2, we evaluate the nudge treatment on self-reported installations in the follow-up survey as well as willingness to install in the initial survey."
