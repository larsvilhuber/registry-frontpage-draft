abstract: "Disaster relief often faces delays due to administrative bottlenecks and approval processes. These delays can last for weeks or even months, exacerbating the challenges faced by vulnerable populations. We study a cutting-edge program in Fiji, where an insurance-based disaster relief mechanism is being integrated into the national social protection system, which facilitates automated payouts and can help stabilize government relief budgets. Fiji is susceptible to climate risks like droughts, extreme rainfall, and, notably, tropical cyclones. Using a cluster randomized controlled trial, we will assess both the ex ante and ex post impacts of natural hazard insurance on the behavior, resilience, and attitudes of climate-vulnerable social protection beneficiaries in Fiji. 

Our study promises to offer valuable insights into this pioneering intervention in Fiji and to inform similar initiatives in the broader Pacific region and globally. The findings have the potential to reshape how social protection systems tackle climate-related disasters. Our close collaboration with local partners, including the team rolling out similar insurance across the region, means that our study is likely to result in a tangible policy impact."
