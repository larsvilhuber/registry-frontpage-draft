abstract: "Developing children’s oral language skills has been the focus of research and policy for a number of years. Social disadvantage is closely associated with language delay and language delay impacts on social emotional and behavioural development and the ability of children to access the curriculum. The extent of poor oral language skills in the population and the significant impact that this has on children’s long term outcomes points to the need for a systematic approach to the challenge at both universal and targeted levels of intervention.There are currently a number of oral language interventions in the public domain both within the UK and more widely, the majority of which are targetedselecting subgroups of children within schools and classes who have been identified as ‘at risk’. By contrast this trial evaluates a universal intervention (Talking Time http://www.stass.co.uk/publications/talking-time) focusing on children at most risk of experiencing poor language trajectories, comparing their performance in language development to those children in nursery classes experiencing business as usual. The participants in this study are attending nurseries in the most socially disadvantaged areas in London and the north east of England. All children in the study will be between three and four years years of age. The nurseries will then be randomised to a treatment and a business as usual arm. The treatment arm will consist of a manualised intervention, Talking Time, which targets a range of oral language skills and provides staff with tailored support about talking with children. 

Unlike other interventions which focus on targeted language support, Talking Time was devised as a universal approach which aims to support language learning for all children in the classroom by embedding the activities within the day to day running of the settings and supporting staff to develop ways of talking with children. Effectively through manualised activities staff are scaffolded in using different materials and foci to support children’s language learning. This is particularly important in areas of social disadvantage where both the children’s oral language is less well developed and the input they are reported to receive in early years settings is more impoverished. 
For educational settings a strength of Talking Time is that the activities are consistent with the early years curriculum and training of staff in effective ways to talk with children will, in theory, generalize to the setting more widely. Thereby benefitting the children who experience Talking Time and also increasing work force capacity. We explicitly test this hypothesis, unlike in other studies which focus on targeted interventions, by including setting measures and staff questionnaires. 

The intervention has been found to be effective in a small trial in inner London and will be scaled up in this study  and enhanced to include professional development to support adult-child oral language interactions within the activities and across the settings. The primary outcomes are changes in the children’s language skills and the language-learning environment of the classroom. Social emotional development and staff knowledge are examined as secondary outcomes. The effects of child and setting factors will also be included in the analysis to capture barriers to implementation."
