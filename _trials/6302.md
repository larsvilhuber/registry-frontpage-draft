abstract: "The main objective of this project is to study how the effects of information provision vary with the scale of the intervention. We evaluate the effects of an intervention that provides information of product availability and product characteristics on consumer demand. It is hypothesized that the potential changes to consumer demand can vary due to information spillovers when many consumers in the same market are exposed to the information treatment. Heterogeneous effects across types of consumers could increase or decrease differences in the allocation of products across consumers. On the other hand, if many consumers are more informed of their options and behave in a similar way, this may create congestion in the short run, leading some consumers to not be able to get what they wanted even if in the medium run, supply can adjust to accommodate the change in demand. We study these issues in the context of school choice where consumers are families that submit a ranked ordered list to a centralized assignment mechanism and are later assigned to schools depending on a specific set of rules, capacities, and overall demand. This allows for the design of a study where we can in theory disentangle the spillover effects of the information intervention on choices separately from the congestion effects that occur when aggregate demand changes prior to any supply side adjustments. We provide individual families as well as entire neighborhood markets with information about the schools that are nearby. We observe their applications as well as their later assignments and matriculation choices. We can test whether the intervention changed their applications as well as their later assignments. The eligible population for this study consists of all parents from dense urban areas (i.e. those with many schooling options) who participate in the centralized school choice process for the academic year 2021 in Chile. Since our implementing partner is the school choice administration itself, we are able to include almost the entire eligible population as part of our study. Our goal is to help determine where information provision at scale can be helpful at improving match quality and reducing segregation while also taking into account that a scaled-up intervention could have adverse effects on some applicants due to increased congestion in the short run."
