abstract: "Chicago's Department of Family and Support Services will provide summer employment and an adult mentor to disadvantaged Chicago youth over the summer of 2015 through its "One Summer PLUS" program. The researchers are assisting DFSS in running a lottery to randomly assign the pool of program applicants into two treatment groups and one control group, and evaluating the outcomes of the program. This random-assignment lottery will allow the program to be evaluated as a randomized controlled trial. Applicants will be randomly assigned to two versions of the program - one including an adult job mentor and one that only provides the job itself - or to a control group.

We will track applicants to the program through existing administrative databases to assess the short- and long-term effects of the government's program, including education, crime, and labor market outcomes. Additionally, we will survey youth (both offered and not offered the program) in order to learn more about the differences in experiences and outcomes between those who were offered the program and those who were not. This is the third in a series of studies of Chicago's One Summer PLUS summer employment program."
