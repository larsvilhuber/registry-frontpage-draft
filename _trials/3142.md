abstract: "The intervention is a randomized control trial (RCT) that aims to enhance the self-efficacy of individuals on the edge of the labor market to help them find small jobs, even if it is only a few hours per week. Prior evidence has shown that a lack of perceived self-efficacy is a good predictor of job-search intentions, actual job-search behavior, and the future employment status. This study employs an information intervention to increase the beliefs that long-term unemployed hold about their ability to find work, even if only for a few hours per week. The intervention consists of sending out SMS text messages to long-term unemployed in Denmark. Subjects are recruited through employment agencies and randomized into treatment and control groups. The treatment group receives text messages that allow the recipients to directly access audio-visual job-search guidance and videos displaying positive testimonials of successful citizens who have found small-jobs, despite substantial challenges. The messages are targeted based on a brief survey that identifies the citizenâ€™s barriers to job search. Through the testimonials, the long-term unemployed learn about the successes of other citizens in situations comparable to their own. Such vicarious learning has been shown in the psychological literature to enhance perceived self-efficacy. "
