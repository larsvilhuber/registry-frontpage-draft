abstract: "In the West Sahel region, soil erosion deteriorates soil fertility and diminishes land productivity, posing a threat to food security. This process occurs gradually over time, making it challenging for farmers to recognize its detrimental effects. However, without intervention to prevent soil erosion, farmland productivity is expected to decline significantly within a couple of decades. Therefore, it is crucial for farmers in the West Sahel region to adopt soil erosion prevention technology. The Fallow Band System (FBS) is the new technology to prevent soil erosion, which does not require labor or other inputs to employ this technology. This study aims to elucidate the mechanisms and constraints of farmers' decision to adopt FBS by conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with multiple interventions in the central of Burkina Faso, where soil erosion is a significant problem. Our interventions include providing technical training for FBS, general information and/or detailed scientific information on soil erosion and degradation, a field day, and/or offering conditional cash transfers to offset any income reduction resulting from FBS adoption. By elucidating the mechanisms of farmers' decision-making of adopting FBS, we attempt to find effective strategies to disseminating soil erosion prevention technology."
