abstract: "A 3-day food record questionnaire (one day off and two days non-off) was taken from 2 groups at the beginning of the study. On the day patients were diagnosed as infected, they were asked to start taking supplements for 4 weeks and come back 4 weeks later for the first dose of vaccine. Patients were again asked to continue taking the supplement. Six to eight weeks after the first dose of vaccination, patients returned for a second dose of vaccine and were again asked to continue taking the supplement. 4 weeks after the second dose of vaccination, participants were asked to return for blood collection. Thus, participants continued to take the supplement for 14-16 weeks."
