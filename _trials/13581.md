abstract: "We explore the role of memory in maintaining optimistic beliefs about the payoff consequences of past choices, consistent with models of anticipatory utility and optimal expectations. We do so in a setting designed to generate anticipatory motives: participants never learn the true consequences of their choices and can therefore distort their beliefs indefinitely. Relative to previous work, we use a design where the causal impact of the payoff-relevance of information is clearly identified: across treatment conditions, we manipulate the relationship between a signal and payoffs without affecting the objective distribution of the signal."
