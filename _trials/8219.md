abstract: "Can AI outperform current HR practices in selecting employees for the position of credit salesman? What is the role of economic preferences versus psychological types in explaining the heterogeneity of the employees’ performance?

We will run a field experiment in a microfinance company in Kyrgyzstan. In the first stage, current employees of the firm will answer survey questions to measure a number of economic preferences and psychological traits. We will anonymously match the responses to the survey questions to the personnel data of the firm including a measures of the productivity of the employees. We will train an AI algorithm to predict which employees perform best. The next stage will consist in applying the algorithm to study its usefulness for hiring decisions. Some employees will be hired following the existing procedure in place in the firm, others accodring to the recommendation of the AI algorithm and we will compare the results of the two groups of employees in term of productivity, size and risk of the portfolio.
