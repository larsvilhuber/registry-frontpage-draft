abstract: "The intervention consists of Unconscious Bias Training (UBT) designed specifically for primary school teachers. The training builds on rich evidence from an ever-growing interdisciplinary literature and has been fine-tuned to the primary school setting via two pilot studies in both the UK and Italy. Our theory of change is that making teachers aware of the existence and pervasiveness of unconscious bias and suggesting concrete actions to counter it (targeting classroom environments, modes of communication and feedback, and teaching Unconscious Bias (UB) to children) can improve teacher practices, learning environments, and, in the long run, pupilsâ€™ outcomes."
