abstract: "A large literature examines demand-side barriers to product adoption. In this experiment, we investigate supply-side barriers. We recruited entrepreneurs from BRAC's network of community health providers (CHPs) to distribute solar lights in rural Uganda. We provide entrepreneurs with training and information on solar lights. We then randomized over which arrangement to offer to the entrepreneurs. There were three contractual feature that we varied, one aimed at addressing credit constraints, one aimed at addressing vendor uncertainty, and one aimed at addressing customer uncertainty. We explored how each of these features influence overall sales performance of entrepreneurs.
