abstract: "Public transportation fares are often unaffordable for low-income riders. We conduct an experiment that provides public transportation fare subsidies to 9,574 working-age residents of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania who receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. Study participants were randomly assigned to receive either a 0%, 50%, or 100% discount on all Pittsburgh Regional Transit (PRT) bus and light rail trips for 12 months. Study outcomes will include public transportation use, transportation mode substitution, earnings and labor supply, health care utilization, self-reported measures of well-being, and spatial mobility as measured by cell phone GPS data."
