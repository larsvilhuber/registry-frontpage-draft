abstract: "Recent research suggests that individuals often justify egoistic behavior by leveraging uncertainties, resulting in excuse-driven risk preferences. However, it remains unclear whether individuals can recognize the excuse-driven behaviors of others. This research investigates the ability of individuals to predict others' behaviors in risky decision-making scenarios and examines the influence of gender stereotypes on their predictions. In our laboratory experiment, participants will complete a decision task and a prediction task. The decision task aims to assess participants’ excuse-driven risk preferences, while the prediction task focuses on their predictions about others’ behaviors in similar risk scenarios. In each task, participants evaluate risky payoffs and certain amounts for themselves or their partners with or without interpersonal trade-offs. We hypothesize that individuals can anticipate others’ excuse-driven behaviors. When predicting the degree of others' excuses, the respondents may rely on a combination of their excuse-driven risk preferences and gender stereotypes."
