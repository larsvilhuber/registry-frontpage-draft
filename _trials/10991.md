abstract: "We implement an iterated audit design to capture the extent to which total discrimination in the market is 'systemic,' that is, due to discrimination from another point in time and/or domain. We used a hiring and recruitment agency to recruit hiring managers (N = 208) with experience in evaluating applicants to entry-level jobs and who were currently looking for employees. These hiring managers were incentivized to evaluate fictitious resumes to an entry level job on the likelihood of the applicant being hired for the job, on a scale from 1 to 10. They were shown 4 resumes drawn at random from 3 sets. Sets A and C differed on group identity as well as prior work experience, while sets A and B differed on group identity only. We compare the hiring likelihood between the three sets to obtain measures of total, direct, and systemic discrimination."
