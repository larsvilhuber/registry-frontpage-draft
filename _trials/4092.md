abstract: "Research on basic education in developing countries has recently been shifting its focus from accessibility to schooling towards the quality of schooling. Inevitably, this will put the performance of teachers at the center of the debate. While recent data from African countries, India and El Salvador document alarmingly low levels of teacher content knowledge, we lack rigorous evidence as to how this problem may be tackled. This field experiment aims at providing novel insights on the effectiveness of subject-based teacher training programs. The evaluated intervention targets primary school math teachers and consists of a five-month in-service training combining (1) computer-assisted self-studying and (2) monthly workshops. The design of the study allows to identify the causal effect of the implemented teacher training program on the content knowledge of participants and to examine the persistency of the effect over the course of one year.
