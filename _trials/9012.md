abstract: "The aim of this research project is to identify whether there exists discrimination against gay and transgender individuals in rental markets of big cities in Latin America. To measure the extent of discrimination, we will implement a field experiment building on the correspondence study methodology (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2004; Jowell and Prescott-Clarke, 1970; Riach and Rich, 1991). Guided by models of discrimination, we will test whether the empirical evidence is consistent with models of taste-based discrimination (Becker, 1957) or statistical discrimination (Arrow, 1973; Phelps 1972)."
