abstract: "This trial is an impact evaluation assessing the effect of Kickstart International's irrigation pumps on farmer welfare in Kenya. The evaluation of the cohort study consists of a panel analysis of small scale farming households across 35 districts that bought the pump in 2009, 2011 and 2015. Baseline and midline data collection of the cohorts that bought pumps in 2009 and 2011 was carried out by IFPRI, while the 2015 endline was conducted by the Busara Center for Behavioral Economics.

The attached document outlines the evaluation design, outcome variables and econometric methods Busara will use to assess the effect of the pump on income and assets, land management practices, food security and consumption, time allocation, as well as intra-household decision-making."
