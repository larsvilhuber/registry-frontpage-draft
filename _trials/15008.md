abstract: "This research examines water management challenges in Uzbekistan's agricultural sector, where upstream and downstream farmers face significantly different water access conditions within the same irrigation networks. In a country where agriculture consumes 90% of water resources, downstream farmers often struggle with water scarcity due to overconsumption by upstream users. While government subsidies for drip irrigation systems can reduce water usage by 30% and increase yields by 20%, adoption rates vary dramatically by location, from zero to wide adoption, suggesting that financial incentives alone may be insufficient to promote widespread adoption of water-saving technologies.

The study implements a structured experimental design using modified Irrigation games, an established methodology for studying water resource management, to test whether participatory interventions can enhance the effectiveness of subsidy programs and promote cooperation between upstream and downstream farmers. Our experiment spans four regions in Uzbekistan, with 32 Irrigation games conducted across 16 districts (two games per district), involving 160 farmers total. We modify the traditional Irrigation game framework to incorporate investment decisions for water-saving technologies while maintaining the fundamental upstream-downstream dynamics. Our mathematical model suggests that adoption decisions are influenced not only by water availability but also by social dynamics and community cooperation.

This research aims to: (1) examine whether Irrigation games can increase technology adoption rates beyond what subsidies alone achieve, (2) analyze differences in adoption patterns between upstream and downstream farmers, and (3) investigate how the adoption of water-saving technologies by upstream farmers impacts water availability and subsequent adoption decisions by downstream users. The findings will contribute to understanding behavioral barriers to technology adoption and inform policy interventions for sustainable water management in agricultural systems.

We hypothesize that: (1) Irrigation games could increase the adoption rate of water-saving technologies compared to subsidies alone by improving farmers' understanding of collective benefits; (2a) in cases of high water distribution disparities, midstream farmers will show the highest adoption rates within the games; (2b) in cases of low water distribution disparities, upstream farmers will lead in adoption due to their greater control over water resources and higher social benefits from installation; and (3) the adoption of water-saving technologies will have differential effects depending on overall water availability - under abundant water conditions, adoption will improve water availability for other farmers, while under severe shortages, adopters will use their improved efficiency to maintain their own production rather than share saved water."
