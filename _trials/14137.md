abstract: "We conduct two online survey experiments to estimate partisan workersâ€™ willingness to pay for jobs that signal partisan values or that have explicitly partisan attributes. The first survey is a framing experiment in which we synthesize job ads that do or do not emphasize liberal values such as the diversity of employees or the attention paid to environmental concerns. The second survey is a conjoint experiment following Maestas et al. (2018) where we ask respondents to choose between hypothetical job profiles that display attributes including the shares of Democrats and Republicans at the workplace. Both surveys are stated-preference experiments where we ask respondents to choose repeatedly between hypothetical jobs. We randomize the salaries of each job, allowing us to estimate willingness to pay for liberal framing or for particular job attributes. Our main outcome of interest is the difference between Democrats, Republicans, and independents in their WTP."
