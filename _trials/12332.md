abstract: "Respondents will be asked to participate in a Willingness-to-Pay incentivized elicitation for listing their phone number in a digital phonebook service. It will include a randomized component with two different primings - 50% of respondents will randomly hear the standard priming, and 50% of respondents will hear a second priming script that lets people know that anyone will be able to access the digital phonebook, including tax collecting officials. The goal is to learn whether being primed to think about taxes lowers firms' willingness-to-pay to list their contact information.  "
