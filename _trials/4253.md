abstract: "We run lab-in-the-field experiments in India to study learning in a household setting and identify the factors that impede the efficient aggregation of information in households. We will ask couples to make a joint decision – guessing the color composition of an urn full of red and white balls –  and give each spouse, separately and privately, a chance to learn information relevant to that decision (i.e., randomly sample balls from the urn). The couple is then asked to discuss and share information and provide a “joint” guess. We will analyze how each spouse’s private information and beliefs influence the final household guess under various treatment conditions."
