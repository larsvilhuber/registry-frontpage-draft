abstract: "We combine a customized survey and randomized controlled trial (RCT) to study the effect of mortgage refinancing on household labor supply. We find that an exogenous reduction in mortgage payments increases working hours, total income, and spending and reduces perceived stress levels. The effects are stronger for those with younger age, lower liquidity, more debt, or higher stress levels. Our results are consistent with that debt decreases labor supply through a financial stress channel."
