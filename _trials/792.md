abstract: "Savings promotion is a key aspect of social protection, as it increases the ability of poor families to hedge themselves against adverse economic shocks; consequently, policies to improve financial inclusion providing formal savings devices have grown worldwide. Despite of the latter, there is evidence that shows that the sole access to saving devices is not necessary related to an increase in savings. Individuals have behavioral problems that limit their savings. Two of them, limited attention and time inconsistency, have proven to be important, as SMS savings remainders and financial instruments with default savings have been effective in increasing the amounts of savings. Therefore, our proposal seeks to execute a randomized impact evaluation of both types of devises in vulnerable population of Chile; a novel investigation as far as the research team is concerned. We will also test the effectiveness of providing savings rule of thumbs, as a mechanism to help individuals to make good decisions with limited bandwidth.  The study will evaluate the effect of these treatments in variables such as formal savings, investment, consumption smoothing, among others, providing important information about financial behavior in low income population.
