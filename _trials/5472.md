abstract: "One of the largest measured factors contributing to the gender wage gap is sorting across occupations and industries (Blau & Kahn, 2017). This sorting behavior may be driven by workers' second-order beliefs--- beliefs about other people's beliefs--- through
the job application decision. To determine whether second-order beliefs are an important mechanism underlying this type of sorting by gender behavior through the job application decision, I combine a natural field experiment with a structured online lab experiment. In the field experiment, I solicit applications for a real high-paying white-collar job using ads that vary the relevant second-order beliefs. This variation is along two dimensions: the gender of the hiring manager and the gender associations of the product sector. After
interested candidates make their job application decision, I invite them to an online lab experiment that elicits their second-order beliefs using a methodology established in Dustan, Koutout, & Leo (2020). This measurement of beliefs in the same population as the job application decision allows me to present the first evidence on whether second-order beliefs affect labor market behavior."
