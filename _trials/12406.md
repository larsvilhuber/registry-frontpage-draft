abstract: "A growing body of evidence finds that comprehensive programs, designed to address the multiple barriers community college students face to degree attainment, hold substantial promise for improving community college completion rates (Weiss et al., 2019; Sommo et al., 2018; Evans et al., 2017). Our research team has added to this literature through an RCT of the OMD program. OMD is a non-profit organization that provides financial, academic, personal, and professional supports to community college students. Our study found that the randomized offer of a spot in the OMD program leads to a statistically significant and substantively meaningful increase in community college enrollment, persistence, and associate degree attainment three years after randomization (Hallberg, Hofmeister, Bertrand, & Morgan, 2022). 

Building on this RCT in which 4,878 aspiring community college students were randomly assigned to either an offer of a spot on the OMD program or business as usual support, the proposed study aims to add to this literature by examining the long-term effects of providing holistic supports to community college students. Specifically, we will examine the impact of the OMD program on students’ long-term employment prospects and four-year college transfers and bachelor’s degree attainment. We will also use these data and those from the original RCT to complete an analysis of the program’s cost effectiveness.
