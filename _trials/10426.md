abstract: "This project attempts to improve on existing lending models to finance the purchase of large agricultural assets. Jack et al. (2019) studied water tank loans offered to dairy farming households in central Kenya and found that allowing borrowers to collateralize their loans with the asset itself — rather than 100% with cash deposits by the borrower and guarantors — increased demand by 10-20 fold without meaningfully increasing default. In this project, we will test three potential ways to further increase access to finance for large agricultural assets. First, we will estimate the impacts of loan contract duration on demand and repayment. Given the durability of the water tanks, which have a 15-30 year lifespan, longer loan contracts might be socially optimal, allowing for manageable monthly payments for the poorest borrowers who otherwise couldn’t afford to take out a loan. However, the impact of offering such contracts on lender profits is ambiguous: longer loan contracts could decrease default by reducing the monthly payment amount, but they could also bring in more risky marginal borrowers or expose the lender to an increased risk of macroeconomic or climate shocks during the longer repayment period. Second, we will examine whether layaway plans, with scheduled monthly savings toward a water tank, improve the ability of farmers to obtain water tanks — many SACCOs in Kenya are capital constrained and can only finance a small number of loans. Layaway plans for large assets might help to increase adoption when local financial institutions can’t meet members’ demand for credit, and they may also be attractive to poor or debt-averse borrowers who are unable or unwilling to take out loans. Finally, we will test a novel contract combining commitment savings and credit, which allows members to save gradually in a layaway plan until they reach a minimum down payment and then transition to a loan whenever they choose; our design will allow us to measure the effects of reducing savings constraints while providing guaranteed access to future credit."
