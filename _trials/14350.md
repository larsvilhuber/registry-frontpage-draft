abstract: "Malnutrition is pervasive in Uganda, with about 30% of children experiencing stunted growth. This is linked to a lack of knowledge of good nutrition practices and social norms limiting the consumption of certain foods for vulnerable members. These challenges are most prevalent in the consumption of ASFs. In this study, we implement a combination of gender-differentiated interventions to improve the nutritional outcomes of children and mothers. In our baseline treatment (WN), we deliver a nutrition knowledge module similar to a standard Village Health Team (VHT) nutrition package, as captured by the MIYCAN Counselling Cards of the Ugandan Ministry of Health. This is only administered to women. The second treatment (WmenN) arm receives a similar nutrition knowledge intervention for males. In the third arm (WmenNSN), we implement an intervention that goes beyond the provision of knowledge and changes behaviors and social norms regarding ASF consumption. This is administered to both men and women.  We test the impacts of WNSN and WmenNSN relative to the WN through a clustered randomized controlled trial."
