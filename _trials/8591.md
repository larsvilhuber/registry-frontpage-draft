abstract: "Given the important role of perceptions of immigration, and its potential connection with perceptions of inequality to explain preferences for redistribution, we propose to analyze jointly the two phenomena for two reasons. First,  Western countries are experiencing both a growing level of inequality and immigration. Second, perceptions and public preferences need to be understood in a multidimensional framework since  people hold many perceptions that affect many policy views. Following the above arguments, we test the hypothesis that  redistributive policies might be better understood by using both information on inequality and immigration perceptions. To test this, we will use a survey experiment in Italy following a burgeoning stream of literature using informational treatments to investigate self-reported redistributive preferences. In particular, we will manipulate perceptions on inequality and immigration using four informational treatments where three of them interact information on inequality with different information on immigration. In the first treatment,  we provide information on inequality by stressing differences between rich and poor (treatment 1). In the second treatment, we provide information on inequality as in treatment 1 but also information on the the native-immigrants composition of poverty in Italy (treatment 2). In treatment 3, information on inequality as in treatment 1 is interacted with information on the cultural diversity of immigrants in terms of religion and country of origin (treatment 3); finally, the last treatment includes the three information on inequality, the native-immigrants composition of poverty, and the cultural diversity of immigrants (treatment 4). In so doing, we capture the multidimensionality of perceptions. But we also capture the multidimensionality of  redistributive preferences by  distinguishing between general preference for redistribution, preferences over tax rate, preferences over public spending sectors, support for poor benefits, support for the inclusion of migrants in welfare programs.
