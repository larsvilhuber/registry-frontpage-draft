abstract: "This study employs a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with scenario experiments to delve into the allocation of rewards by virtual team leaders. It investigates how leaders make decisions regarding the distribution of rewards among themselves and their team members, under different scenarios that revolve around when leaders decide on reward allocation and the information available to them.
In this experimental setup, participants are asked to imagine themselves as team leaders with the authority to determine how rewards are allocated within the team. The key question revolves around what percentage of the total team earnings leaders choose to allocate to themselves and what reasoning underlies their choices.
Furthermore, this research aims to shed light on how real-world leaders behave differently from the often observed "rational" dictators in simple games. It explores the expressions of traits like generosity and responsibility in leaders' decisions and seeks to identify the individual characteristics associated with such behaviors.
To accomplish this, an online survey methodology is employed, and the study also examines whether personality traits and gender play a role in influencing these allocation decisions."
