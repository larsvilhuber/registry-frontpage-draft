abstract: "The study tests the impact of a brief intervention combining an information treatment, a perspective-taking experience ("snack in the dark") and an inter-group contact (visually impaired waiters), on discrimination towards individuals with visual disabilities. Participants are about 200 upper secondary school students from 3 schools in the region of Trentino. Students are randomized to the treatment within class. Other 6 classes serve as an additional pure control group to investigate the potential role of spillovers. "
