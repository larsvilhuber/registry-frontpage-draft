abstract: "We study how a business training program affects the aspirations, goals, and entrepreneurship outcomes of women in rural Nepal and whether these outcomes can be improved by (a) training women in heterogeneous pairs from their social networks and (b) administering an additional module that focuses on the role of pooling network contacts to deal with business risk. We will first study the effect of being trained alone compared to being trained with a randomly chosen person in the network who is close/far in terms of network distance and similar/different in terms of their network centrality. Then, we will administer and study the effects of a treatment which additionally focuses on the usage of network contacts to share various risks that are a part of setting up a new business. This will allow us to disentangle risk-sharing with network peers as a potential mechanism that can boost aspirations and compare it with the effect of cooperation. The design will allow us to assess whether (a) social networks can be leveraged to improve business outcomes and (b) whether sharing network contacts to deal with risk is an important channel relative to cooperation or information sharing.
