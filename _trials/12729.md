abstract: "We study how bundling together policy recommendations on different policy issues affects voters' policy views. Voters are randomized into (i) treatment messages, each consisting of policy recommendations on two policy issues, and (ii) control messages, where policy recommendations are sent separately.  The issues bundled differ in ideological value, policy domain, and complexity. We investigate the presence of belief spillovers across policy domains, and the role played by trust and identity in explaining these spillovers."
