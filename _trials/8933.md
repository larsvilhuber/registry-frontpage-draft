abstract: "The current study aims to test a digital tool â€“ The Mind Tutor -  which was developed in conjunction with students and university wellbeing services, in order to provide students with tools to use to manage their wellbeing whist at university. Mind Tutor integrates academic support with wellbeing support based on feedback from students. Mind Tutor uses an artificial intelligence (AI) tool, whereby users interact with a chatbot.  Mind Tutor was developed to address five key areas relating to student wellbeing and attainment. 
We aim to recruit a minimum of 400 first year undergraduate students into the study
The primary objectives of this study are
a) To determine the impact of the Mind Tutor on subjective wellbeing over a 6 week period in comparison to an inactive control group and;
b) To determine the overall feasibility of delivering a 6 week RCT to assess the effectiveness of the Mind Tutor on subjective wellbeing in university students.
