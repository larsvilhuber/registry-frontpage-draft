abstract: "Financial education is a key priority of the policy agenda aimed at fostering financial inclusion and enhancing economic and development outcomes. While academic research on the impact of financial education on financial knowledge and decisions have been rapidly expanding, most of the evidence focuses on low-income individuals and developing economies (Kaiser, Lusardi, Menkhoff, and Urban, 2022). However, having the necessary knowledge, skills, and attitudes to make good financial decisions is not just relevant for this group of people or countries. For instance, a recent survey conducted by the European Commission highlighted the urgent need to improve financial literacy in the European Union (EU), with only 18 percent of citizens demonstrating a high level of financial literacy (European Commission, 2023). In this project, we have the ideal setting to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) on financial education in a developed OECD country (Portugal), targeting mainly middle-income individuals, with the adults spread throughout the country. Indeed, Portugal ranked last among EU members in the latest European Commission’s financial literacy ranking, and national authorities such as the country’s central bank (Banco de Portugal) and other government agencies have put forward different strategies to increase financial and digital literacy levels.

We plan to conduct an RCT using a financial literacy program named “Finanças para Todos” (i.e., Finance for All) to be implemented by the Finance Knowledge Center of the Nova School of Business and Economics. A pilot of the program took place during the 2022/2023 academic year, which had around 700 participants attending in person or online and was highly successful in terms of demand for the program and feedback received. Our experimental design consists of randomly allocating participants to a treatment group that is assigned to attend the financial literacy program (in-person or online format) or a control group that is not assigned to attend the training. 

All individuals in the sample had previously self-enrolled into the program following an outreach campaign using different news outlets in the country. Our sample consists of over 5200 participants of which 66% are women, 74% have attained some higher education level, 76% have some type of credit product, and 44% have a household income higher than 2000EUR. The average age is 40 years.
