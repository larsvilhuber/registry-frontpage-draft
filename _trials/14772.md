abstract: "Singapore is one of the fastest ageing countries while there are impediments to working at old age, stemming from employers’ concerns regarding the employability and productivity of aging workers. Recent literature started to find that age does correspond with workplace wisdom, and older workers may have comparative advantages over younger workers in facilitating collaborative work or mentoring. In this study, we seek to fill the gap in the literature on identifying the specific contributions of older workers in the success of multigenerational team. We evaluate the performances of unigenerational and multigenerational teams through an online experiment simulating real-life teamwork situation in the services industries. Our study is thus expected to generate novel insights regarding older workers’ comparative advantages as well as possible directions of workplace/job reconfiguration for Singapore’s aging workforce."
