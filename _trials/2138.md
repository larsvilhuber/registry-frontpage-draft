abstract: "What helps to improve the effectiveness of financial literacy programs in promoting household economic welfare? This study examines the impact of a financial literacy and savings training that was integrated into a broader psychosocial parenting intervention. We conduct a cluster randomized control trial  with 40 village/township clusters in the Eastern Cape of South Africa, comparing  20 treatment settlements that receive the 14-session parenting & financial literacy support program with 20 control settlements that receive a 1-day water hygiene program. We examine whether this program can increase savings, borrowing, and financial planning, as well as help reduce financial distress, vulnerability to economic shocks, and improve economic welfare.
