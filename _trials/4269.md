abstract: "We conduct a randomized controlled trial in a Bangladeshi garment factory in which randomly selected workers are invited to discuss suggestions for improvement over lunch with a randomly selected co-worker who is either a friend or a non-friend. We analyse the extent to which firm-related and worker-related outcome variables differ between pairs and individuals. Furthermore, we aim to answer the question whether the distribution of the quantity and quality of suggestions can be shifted upwards by active management such as giving recognition and feedback to employees."
