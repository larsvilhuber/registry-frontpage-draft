abstract: "Impaired social skills interfere with social, emotional and academic functioning, and are frequently observed in children with emotional and behavioral disorders. Adolescents with social skills deficits have decreased social competence that is related to higher levels of child’s internalizing and externalizing problems. To the best of our knowledge there is a lack of literature regarding social skill training in Pakistani school children, this highlights the critical requirement of indigenous, evidence-based intervention to address these problems. Present study aims to evaluate feasibility and treatment efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy-based intervention for enhancing social skills in secondary school children of Pakistan through a randomized control trial. The sample of 28 students, age range 14-18 years, were taken from 4 different schools of Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Initial screening of 651 participants was done using BASC- Behavioral and Emotional Screening system 3 (BASC-BESS 3). A total of 28 students were allocated in intervention group and control group. Intervention group received cognitive behavior therapy based social skills training, which consisted of eight group sessions per week each lasting for 50-60 minutes. Control group did not receive any treatment. The results revealed that intervention was sufficient in reducing social skill deficits and enhancing personal adjustment among participants Results indicated a significant change in Personal Risk Index (PRI) due to treatment in timeline (F=40.48, p=.00, ηp2=.67), group (F=16.36, p=.00, ηp2=.45) and interaction of group*timeline (F=19.67, p=.00, ηp2=.49). Whereas, a difference is also shown in secondary issues as self-regulation and internalizing risk index. In addition to this an overall decrease in Behavioral and Emotional Risk index is also revealed.  "
