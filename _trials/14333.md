abstract: "We study how pharmacies and clinics in Western Kenya make decisions that are critical to local health outcomes and antimicrobial resistance, such as the appropriateness of provided medications, diagnostic efforts, diagnostic accuracy, and the provision of partial dosages. We send standardized patients in multiple visits to a sample of 200 providers where we randomly vary the standardized patient's reported symptoms, willingness to provide symptoms, drug requests, and expressed price sensitivity. We plan to assess whether the actions a standardized patient takes influences the provider's willingness to ask diagnostic questions, the recommended drug, and the transaction price."
