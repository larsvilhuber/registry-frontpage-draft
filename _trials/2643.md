abstract: "Extracurricular programming, particularly organized sports, are in high demand at the same time that sports participation rates for low-income children are diminishing (Afterschool Alliance, 2014; Aspen Institute, 2017).  If participation in high-quality sports programming induces academic, social emotional learning, or health benefits, then the "opportunity gap" during middle childhood may contribute to inequalities later in life.  However, there exists little causal evidence on the effects of participation on elementary school sports teams.  In this paper, University of Chicago Urban Labs (Urban Labs) in collaboration with Urban Initiatives (UI) examines the causal effects of UI's Work to Play program.  Work to Play promotes health and positive youth development through soccer programming.  Participants, mostly 2nd-4th grade students, meet before or after school three times a week for 20 weeks during fall and spring seasons at 43 Chicago Public Schools (CPS).

Urban Labs randomized students to Work to Play rosters or a wait list at 19 oversubscribed schools during the 2017-2018 school year.  Urban Labs will measure the impact of the intervention using CPS administrative data and primary data collected from students, their parents, and their teachers.  Our primary analysis measures the treatment-on-treated effect of Work to Play participation on students' school grades, self-management behaviors, and body mass index percentile.  Findings from this research will not only equip UI with a better understanding of the impact of Work to Play across multiple developmental domains, but also provide evidence on whether socioeconomic disparities in access to high-quality sports programming in childhood could induce inequalities later in life."
