abstract: "This study aims at understanding whether provision of information to workers on their relative performance can increase their productivity, and if it does, what are the mechanisms that drive such change. The information is delivered in the form of ranks computed from their performances in the previous month. This study is in collaboration with a Bangladeshi sweater factory, where the workers are paid based on a piece-rate scheme. I introduce rank information to treatment group workers in two different forms - private and public. The outcomes of key interest are productivity, absenteeism, quality of outputs, cooperation, and communication across workers."
