abstract: "The agricultural sector provides plenty of opportunities to improve female farmers’ livelihoods in sub-Saharan Africa. Still, in many countries, the sector is also characterised by gender biases in various forms and diverse areas, even when men and women farmers share comparable abilities. This study investigates the existing gender (social) norms that inform the construction of gender roles in society, allocating “passive” positions to women farmers. In particular, this study focuses on the influence of these social norms in the context of agricultural extension activities. Social norms ingrained in individual beliefs and preferences can influence how individuals respond to information dependent on the gender of extension agents. Through a field experiment with smallholder farmers in Kenya, this study ascertains how shared societal norms encourage gender discrimination in village agricultural extension activities. Additionally, it explores if edutainment on gender roles can influence gender perceptions concerning female village extension service providers."
