abstract: "A growing branch of literature focuses on how to induce people to choose more sustainable products. There are some promising approaches, but they all target only one, independent dimension of pro-environmental behavior (PEB) at one point in time.
However, PEBs are not a set of decisions made independently from each other. Several studies have found behavioral spillovers between PEBs. These spillovers can be either positive (Lanzini and Thøgersen 2014; e.g. Margetts and Kashima 2017) – meaning that having performed a PEB in the past makes a future PEB more likely – or negative (e.g. Chatelain et al. 2018). Besides the usual explanations like moral licensing (e.g. Mazar and Zhong 2010) and rebound effects (e.g. Haan and Girod 2009) for negative behavioral spillovers, Haan and Girod (2009) have proposed mental accounting (cf. Thaler 1980; 2008).
Only few studies so far have considered spillovers between PEB and sustainable consumer choices. Lanzini and Thøgersen (2014) as well as Margetts and Kashima (2017) investigate whether green shopping decisions spill over to PEB, while Thøgersen and Ölander (2003) examined how these choices evolve over time. In a field experiment in China, Zhou et al. (2017) find positive spillovers from PEB to the willingness to pay for eco-labelled rice. Chatelain et al. (2018) test the theory that mental accounting not only influences expenditures, but also environmental-friendly behavior. They find that people are therefore unlikely to perform two similar PEBs within a short time frame if these behaviors are strongly linked to each other. 
This study will be the first one to investigate the spillover between pro-environmental choices in an incentivized online experiment with high stakes, compared to prior experiments that considered for example recycling efforts. The results may foster the discussion of whether hoping for a catalyzing effect of one PEB to another is counterproductive (cf. Thøgersen and Crompton 2009).
