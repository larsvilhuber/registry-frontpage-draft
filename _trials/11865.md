abstract: "An event of the size of the WYD, which is expected to attract more than one million supportive, motivated, and inspiring young people from all around the World to Lisbon is a unique opportunity to study what this particular group thinks about gender roles and gender norms.
We will study how perceptions of potentially morally questionable behaviors are rated as unacceptable or acceptable depending on the gender of those who performed the actions. 
We will run a large-scale field experiment with the pilgrims of the World Youth Day (WYD) that takes place in Lisbon in the first week of August 2023. Half of the respondents of our survey will be asked to rate, on a scale from one to six, three generic (mis)behaviors from three different hypothetical males while the other half will be faced with female names. We will then compare the differences in an econometric framework.
In addition, we will test if the gender of the enumerator (we plan to have around 30 young assistants, most of them students at ISEG – University of Lisbon and Nova SBE) changes how pilgrims at the WYD respond to these questions.
Finally, we will ask if people have confessed or are planning to confess to analyze potential heterogeneous effects.
The Catholic Church plays a significant role in the lives of millions of people around the world. Therefore, understanding the level of gender discrimination in their teachings and actions is of big importance. For example, the construction and evaluation of the effectiveness of public policies for mitigating gender discrimination depends on the existence of discrimination in the family and religious environment, and this discrimination needs to be rigorously studied. The present study intends to overcome the difficulty that has existed in studying discrimination in a religious setting. In particular, it aims to investigate whether Catholics perceive potentially morally unacceptable actions differently based on the gender of the person who committed them."
