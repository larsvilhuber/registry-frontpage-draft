abstract: "Startups face high failure rates, with two thirds never generating a positive return. To facilitate growth of high potential startups, business accelerators have emerged in recent years. These accelerators provide a combination of networking opportunities with peer firms and potential funders, as well as some training in pitching and marketing products effectively. However, there is limited causal evidence on the impact of business incubation and accelerator programs on firm survival and growth, especially in developing countries where the marginal returns to these investments could be high. This project aims to test whether business accelerators causally impact firmsâ€™ outcomes using a randomized control trial in Bangladesh. "
