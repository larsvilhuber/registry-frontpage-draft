abstract: "Swiss TecLadies is a mentoring program organized by the Swiss Academy of Engineering Sciences SATW for female students (15 years or older, mostly in high school). Goal of the program is to increase interest in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) among program participants. Each program participant receives a female mentor with a STEM background that they meet once a month for 7 months.
In this study, we evaluate how the program affects participants’ interest in STEM fields in the short and long run, based on survey data and linked administrative data. We will also analyze whether the mentoring program has spillover effects on the program participants’ classmates. Previous studies suggest that female mentors are most likely to impact students’ outcomes in contexts in which students have few other female role models (Card et al. 2022). Our analysis separates between female program participants with few potential female STEM role models and female students with relatively more female role models before the intervention.
