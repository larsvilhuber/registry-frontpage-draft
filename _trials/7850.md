abstract: "This study investigates how peer-to-peer communication with vaccination supporters affects the willingness to get vaccinated (henceforth, WGV) against Covid-19 among vaccine skeptics and vice versa. Various large-scale surveys in Germany indicate diverging opinions on newly developed vaccines against Covid-19 across different socio-demographic groups. Without increasing the WGV among these groups, it will be extremely challenging and politically costly for the government to attain herd immunity by vaccination. This challenge is further heightened by the widespread misinformation in online echo chambers and  the growing presence of anti-vaxxers communities online. This situation is representative for many other economically and politically relevant situations, where public good provision and the overall welfare depends on coordinated actions of individuals that form their beliefs and motivations within their own social networks. Since online peer-to-peer communication is a relevant source of information for vaccine skeptics, this work aims to shed light on whether and how different types of arguments and persuasion tactics are effective in changing beliefs and motivations.
