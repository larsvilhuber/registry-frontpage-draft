abstract: "Despite large returns to irrigation, only 30% of farmers make use of the newly constructed hillside irrigation schemes in Rwanda, and labor market failures constrain the use of irrigation (Jones et al, 2022). Reducing the labor intensity of irrigation, or alternatively increasing the returns to irrigation, therefore have the potential to increase the use of irrigation. This study estimates the impacts of two interventions on the use of irrigation and farmer profits. The first, the installation of rain hose and drip irrigation systems that substitute for using hoses or buckets, aims to reduce the labor intensity of irrigation. The second, introducing an IVR-based marketplace for agricultural produce and conducting trainings on commercialization of agriculture that link farmers, intermediaries, and downstream buyers, aims to increase the output prices farmers receive for the horticulture they produce using irrigation. These two interventions are randomized across "demo plot groups" that applied to receive installations of irrigation systems intended to reduce the labor intensity of irrigation."
