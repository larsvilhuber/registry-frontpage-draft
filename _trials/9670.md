abstract: "In-group favouritism and out-group hostility are well-known phenomena in research, which are repeatedly documented across fields, contexts and methods. But the world around us does not always fit into this dichotomy of in- and out-group. Often there is a "middle-group" that shares some identity characteristics with the in-group, but ultimately neither belongs to the in-group, nor is an alien out-group. This setting raises the question how altruistic actions towards a middle-group compare to actions in favour of an in-group or against an out-group. 

Using an online laboratory experiment, we investigate altruistic actions in an allocation task with the minimal group paradigm. Through a between-subject design we causally identify the change in altruistic actions when a middle group is introduced into the two-group setting of in- and out-group. Furthermore, we vary the identity characteristics of the middle-group which allows us to measure the impact of characteristics and arrange the types of middle-groups on a scale.

With this paper we extend the current research on in- and out-groups conceptually and our results help to model dynamics behind altruistic actions towards different groups, for example refugee groups with diverse backgrounds.
