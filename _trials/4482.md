abstract: "In a citizen-facing and pro-social department like education, we argue that non-monetary motives such as the desire for recognition, in-tangible career incentives, and/or intrinsic motives such as the desire to serve the community may also be important determinants in the primary school teacherâ€™s decision to exert effort. If such tools are effective, they may also be more feasible than financial incentives in a developing world setting where limited public sector budgets have many competing priorities. Motivated by this, our study implements a randomized field experiment with the Punjab Training Academy in which public school teachers receive various types of non-monetary incentives across four districts of Punjab in a teacher training setting. The study aims to explore the effectiveness of the designed interventions, channels through which they operate, whether extrinsic incentives crowd out intrinsic motivation, and how treatment effects may be heterogeneous by individual teacher characteristics."
