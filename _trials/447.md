abstract: "HIV can overcome host defence mechanisms by infecting and destroying the immune system, thereby creating immunodeficiency which results in susceptibility to opportunistic infections. Antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) can inhibit viral replication and boost immune competence, halting the progression to AIDS.  However, malnutrition is a major cause of immunodeficiency and efforts to control HIV are compromised by the presence of co-morbid malnutrition. Ugandaâ€™s national response to HIV/AIDS is recognised as strong and effective with prevalence dropping to 6% nationally and the numbers of patients receiving Antiretroviral Therapy rising to 140,000. However, prevalence is rising again in certain populations and many people living with HIV particularly in rural areas still do not have access to the Antiretroviral (ARV) services they need. Moreover, despite efforts by the Ugandan Ministry for Health to boost the nutritional aspects of HIV care a significant percentage of those attending for treatment have mild to moderate malnutrition and do not receive supplementary feeding under the present criteria. The aim of this project is to test a variety of nutrition related interventions to assess their impact on health and welfare outcomes, their impact on behavior in relation to nutrition and the mechanisms through which changes in behavior occur. Our interventions aim to both inform women on the importance of nutrition and how to fulfil their nutritional needs but also how to empower women to improve outcomes for them and their children in a sustainable way. The interventions are based around information provision to women attending clinics for HIV treatment. Specifically we consider three interventions that are simple, cost effective and scalable: 1) a nutritional information campaign; 2) cookery demonstrations on how to produce locally sourced home-made nutritious food; 3) an empowerment intervention involving videos of business success stories of women living in similar circumstances to the participants in our study. Our identification strategy aims to establish causal connections between different types of campaigns and also aims to disentangle underlying mechanisms including the existence of general information constraints; the medium of disseminating information; food insecurity and access to resources; and intra-household considerations. We test interventions across 4 representative sub-regions of Uganda improving the external validity and policy relevance."
