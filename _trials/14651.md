abstract: "Job mobility is a crucial driver of labor market dynamism and an important factor shaping workers’ personal development and earnings growth. Occupational mobility specifically has gained increased relevance in this time of profound transformations in the labor market. Certain occupations are particularly affected by technological change (automation, AI) and the green transition and, thus, are at risk of becoming obsolete.

The goal of this project is to improve our understanding of how employed workers decide about occupational mobility, focusing especially on workers’ beliefs about the transferability of their skills, the costs of switching to a different occupation and finding a new job, and their perceptions of the opportunities they may have in other occupations – the benefits of switching to another occupation. We design a new survey and we plan to administer this survey to a sample of 5,000 employees between 20 and 50 years old in Germany. The new survey will capture detailed information on workers’ beliefs about the benefits and costs of transitioning to other occupations, as well as their willingness to switch occupations. It also features an experimental part where randomly selected groups of respondents receive different pieces of information related to other occupations that are closest to theirs in terms of task similarity, and (if applicable) information about how much their current occupation is exposed to automation or the green transition. These survey data will allow us to i) map respondents’ beliefs about occupational mobility and study how they are related to their mobility intentions; ii) study whether information is able to shift workers’ perceptions of other occupations and influence their career decisions. Furthermore, by linking survey data with administrative data on pre- and post-survey employment histories, we will assess whether workers’ perceptions are accurate and investigate how workers’ past experiences shape their beliefs and how (possibly distorted) perceptions affect workers’ employment choices and career trajectories."
