abstract: "Student evaluation of teaching (SET) scores is one of the most common criterion used by universities to judge instructor quality. Such evaluations are often biased negatively for female instructors. It is more pronounced for junior female instructors, and for the female instructors teaching a technical course, for instance, the ones involving more math. Such discrimination stems mostly from the evaluations by male students and have been tested causally in several developed countries. 

Our study proposes to test this hypothesis in a developing country context where the evidence on gender-bias against women instructors in academia is limited. Using a natural field experiment conducted with over 500 students of Principles of Microeconomics class at a large private university in India, we also test a behavioral intervention to mitigate the gender-bias, if any."
