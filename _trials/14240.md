abstract: "Across the world, women take on a larger share of childcare than men. This traditional division of labor may stifle maternal labor market opportunities while simultaneously limiting paternal attachment to their children. Increasing father involvement in childrearing is a pressing challenge for many families and policymakers alike. In this study, we conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) among new parents in China to study how encouraging father involvement affects paternal investment, family dynamics,  and  family well-being.
