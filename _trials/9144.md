abstract: "Assistance towards the poor in Western economies is often delivered in the form of in-kind transfers. This form is puzzling from the vantage point of standard microeconomic theory, according to which cash transfers are the most efficient means of raising recipients' welfare. To understand the motivations for such policies, we conduct a lab-in-the-field experiments in the US. General population respondents have the opportunity to place restrictions on a transfer we deliver to a welfare recipient who participates in the study. We examine the causes underlying the restrictions individuals impose. We quantify the importance of various motives including respect for the recipient's autonomy. We characterize how these motivations differ depending on whether the welfare recipient is black or white, male or female, and whether the recipient has children. In counterfactual simulations, we then examine whether and how approval of paternalistic constraints on welfare payments would change if individuals had accurate beliefs about the recipients' use of the funds as well as about the demographic composition of the recipient pool."
