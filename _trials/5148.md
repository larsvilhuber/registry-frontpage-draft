abstract: "This study experimentally compares two different interventions aimed at improving early grade reading in English as First Additional Language (EFAL)  in poor communities in South Africa. Both interventions are designed to improve and strengthen teachers’ enactment of the existing government curriculum, and consist of the same three components: (1) detailed lesson plans, (2) integrated learning and teaching support material and (3) instructional coaching and training. The main difference between the two intervention models is in the delivery model of the lesson plans and the coaching support. In Intervention 1, the teachers receive a paper-based version of the lesson plans and benefit from regular on-site coaching. In Intervention 2, the teachers receive a tablet with an electronic version of the lesson plans, including various audio-visual resources and are supported through an ICT coaching model that includes telephone calls and cell phone messaging. The electronic lesson plans are provided on an application which is specifically developed for the study. This application contains additional electronic resources such as short training videos, sound clips of the phonics sounds, songs and rhymes and examples of learners’ work.  

The program was implemented over a period of three years, tracking the same cohort of 20 students per school from the start of grade one (February, 2017) up to the end of grade three (November, 2019). Each year a different set of teachers were exposed to the program: grade one teachers in year one, grade two teachers in year two, and grade three teachers in year three. There were four rounds of data collection: once prior to the start of the program (January, 2017), and again at the end of every year of implementation (November 2017, 2018 and 2019). Another round of data collection is planned for the end of 2020. "
