abstract: "Although India has made tremendous progress in expanding access to primary and secondary school, a large number of children who are enrolled in Class 9 lack basic foundational skills. Previous work using a randomized controlled trial in Uttar Pradesh, India using specialized training periods—“camps”—demonstrated substantial increases in student learning for primary school students (Banerjee et al., 2016). These results suggest that remedial camps are a promising approach to improving overall educational attainment and transforming student outcomes.

The Secondary School Readiness Program (SSRP), developed by the Kusuma Trust (KT), consists of a series of camps that prepare students in class 9 with the skills that they need to pass their board exams. These camps occur in three phases depending upon student learning levels, and are tailored towards remedial learners. These camps operate within the typical school day and use existing teachers, making this approach potentially cost-effective as well as the program is planned to scale up across the state. 

As programs scale-up, tension emerges between harmonizing content to ensure uniform implementation and allowing flexibility to adapt to school-specific needs and conditions. On the one hand, monitoring teachers and enforcing a set schedule and lesson plan can ensure teachers follow best practices and implement programs as designed. On the other hand, teachers may be best informed on how to adapt a program to optimally meet the needs of their students and the school. We propose to measure the impact of implementing SSRP in two different ways: 1) Standard SSRP as currently designed, and 2) Flexible SSRP, where teachers choose which lessons to adopt in their classrooms. We will evaluate the SSRP Program using a randomized control trial.
