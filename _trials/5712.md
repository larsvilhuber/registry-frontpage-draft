abstract: "Many decisions (such as how much or what kind of education to get) are dynamic in nature, with individuals receiving feedback at one point in time and then making decisions much later. Zimmermann (2019) shows that individuals are less likely to recall negative feedback in the long run. Our project builds on this important work by asking whether there are gender differences in the propensity to incorporate positive and negative feedback in immediate and more long-term decision-making, and whether this gender difference depends upon the gender stereotype of the task. We also plan to explore the link between beliefs and choices about how to be compensated for performance, and whether the difficulty of the domain influences belief updating. "
