abstract: "Reciprocation of gifts is well understood in economics and gift-giving is popular in business relationships. However, it is not yet clear whether and how conditional and unconditional business gifts differ in their ability to elicit positive reciprocity. We narrow this gap and conduct a controlled field experiment in collaboration with a local start-up company to study the power of different kinds of small business gifts to acquire new customers. More precisely, in a 2x2 experimental design, we compare the effectiveness of conditional and unconditional gifts, as well as of gifts of money and gifts in kind for customer acquisition. We expect that unconditional gifts are more powerful than conditional gifts in eliciting positive reciprocity. That is, we hypothesize that the success of a customer acquisition campaign is higher if potential customers receive an unconditional business gift compared to receiving the same gift conditional on concluding a contract. Standard economic theory predicts that gifts in money (10 Swiss francs) are more powerful than equal value gifts in kind (box of chocolate). In addition, the unconventional nature of the gift could attract the attention of potential customers. However, monetary gifts can also be seen as a kind of bribery and can establish a market as opposed to a social relationship. In addition, there might be other positive effects of gifts in kind (e.g. personal touch, stronger signals oneâ€™s intention to invest in future relationship)."
