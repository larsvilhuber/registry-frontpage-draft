abstract: "Responses time often provide additional information in message exchanges. Most social media sites now allow users to observe an accurate response time. How does this feature affect userâ€™s responding behavior? To answer this question, we designed a two-stage game between a sender and a receiver. Using a series of experimental measures, we investigate if receivers use response times to make decisions, and if senders manipulate the revealed response times. Additionally, we examine the role of gender, creativity in the manipulative use of response times.
