abstract: "Algorithms based on enormous amounts of data enable new ways of supporting decision making by integrating and improving data-driven predictions. The present project investigates whether and how algorithmic assistance influences advice-giving in ethical dilemmas. The current project is based on outcomes of a prior RCT pre-registered under the file AEARCTR-0003529."
