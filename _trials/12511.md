abstract: "This is an experimental study eliciting beliefs on sleep and bedtime behavior. The study will investigate how randomized information on sleep distribution in a population may affect individuals beliefs about sleep duration and bedtime. The subjects will be divided in three main groups: a control group that will not receive any information, and two groups which will receive different information on sleep duration and bedtime in a reference population. Subjects will be guessing summary statistics of other participants' answers and they will receive bonus amounts based on the accuracy of these guesses."
