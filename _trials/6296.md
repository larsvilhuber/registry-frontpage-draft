abstract: "The proposed study employs survey and experimental methods to: 1) assess the current social, economic and psychological status of formerly abducted women in Northern Uganda as compared to never abducted comparable women; and 2) scientifically test the effectiveness of womenâ€™s support groups in facilitating the reintegration of formerly abducted women, raising their aspirations, creating economic opportunities and increasing their overall well-being.
