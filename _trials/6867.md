abstract: "We study how people evaluate voting procedures that are subject to a voting fee, voting bribes, or the exclusion of poor voters relative to a standard majority vote. Using 10 different questions, participants evaluate these voting procedures according to how democratic/non-democratic most people would judge the procedure to be. Participants are incentivized to match the most common answer in their treatment group. We hypothesize that compared to a standard majority vote, the democracy ratings of voting procedures that are subject to a voting fee, voting bribes, or the exclusion of poor voters are significantly lower.
