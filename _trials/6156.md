abstract: "We partnered with a cataract surgery clinic serving mostly low-income elderly patients in Mexico City to evaluate a randomized price experiment to study how take-up of cataract surgery may be influenced by the provision of amenities in early stages of the patient-provider interaction. The clinic with which we partnered for the experiment offers substantial benefits over the public sector (care meeting international standards and substantially reduced wait times), and is relatively attractive to patients seeking care in the private market because the price of the most basic surgery is set well below competitors’ prices. While consultations represent a large fraction of physicians’ time, surgeries represent a considerably larger fraction of the clinic’s profits. When we were first approached by the clinic, they were particularly interested in maximizing surgery take-up among patients with a positive diagnosis of cataracts. The monetary price of the basic consultation was 50 pesos (roughly 4 USD), and patients had the option to pay a fee to reduce the time spent in the waiting room before being seen by the physician. Clinic management was under the impression that patients that paid the fee to reduce waiting during the first consultation were significantly more likely to take-up the surgery, and believed this pattern may be attributable to the fact that these patients’ first interaction with the clinic was (relatively) pleasant. Accordingly, clinic management decided to experiment with the price of the premium consultation to see if greater take-up could be achieved. The experiment would consist of offering the premium consultation at randomized, promotional prices, subject to some constraints.
