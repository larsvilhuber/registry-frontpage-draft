abstract: "Potentially harmful misinformation runs rampant on social media in many countries. We explore whether repeated exposure to fact-checks can inoculate citizens against misinformation by increasing their social media literacy. In the initial phase of this study, we partnered with Africa Check to deliver variants of a fact-checking podcast or text messages to around 4,500 recruited participants in South Africa twice a month for six months. This study follows up with the same set of participants to examine the longer term effects of this intervention, between 6 months and one year after the initial study had concluded. This follow-up study seeks to understand the longevity of fact-checking and inoculation efforts, with significant policy implications for combating misinformation. It also estimates the dynamic effects over three periods: after three months of exposure to treatment, after six months of exposure to treatment, and around nine months after treatment concluded."
