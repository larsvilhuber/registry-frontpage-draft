abstract: "The proposed experiment investigates the role that credit and access to early commitment mechanisms can have in increasing fertilizer adoption. The context in West Africa - and especially the Sahel - is one with large market inefficiency between agricultural input dealers, agricultural credit providers and farmers. In the seminal Duflo et al. (2012) study of commitment mechanism and fertilizer adoption, early offers of hard commitment mechanism (full payment at commitment) to adopt fertilizer with guaranteed delivery during the planting season were found to induce higher take-up of fertilizer than subsidized or market-priced offers at planting season. Two mechanisms potentially explain these results:  time inconsistent preferences by farmers or the effect of credit constraints during the planting season, when farmers may have exhausted agricultural income from the previous yearâ€™s harvest. The proposed experiment will disentangle the relative importance of commitment mechanisms and credit in increasing fertilizer adoption in rural Mali by partnering with a national microcredit provider and a national network of agro-input dealers to provide agricultural credit on different commitment terms via agricultural input fairs organized throughout the agricultural season."
