abstract: "Insufficient knowledge of appropriate use can hamper technology adoption. In the agricultural context, if farmers do not observe each others' inputs, diffusion of both information on the optimal input mix and of the technology itself may be slow. In a large-scale field experiment, we introduced a simple and salient tool, a blue measuring spoon, to help farmers remember how much fertilizer to use. A randomly selected subset of farmers received the technology for free, and the remaining farmers could purchase it at fertilizer stores at a nominal price. Farmers who were randomly assigned to receive a measuring spoon subsequently improved knowledge of how much fertilizer to use, and were more likely to use fertilizer. Unlike fertilizer adoption itself, purchase and use of measuring spoons diffused rapidly through social networks. We find that the formation of farmers' cooperatives sped the diffusion of the spoons. Finally, a time-limited discount coupon for fertilizer increased fertilizer use in the season of the program."
