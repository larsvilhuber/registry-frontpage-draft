abstract: "The Ultra Poor Graduation Pilot in Honduras is a part of the CGAP/Ford Foundation global initiative, currently being implemented in eight countries, that combines safety net programs with entrepreneurial activities to develop a graduation model for the poorest households. The model incorporates a comprehensive package of services delivered over two years: a productive asset (such as chickens or goats), consumption support, livelihood trainings, healthcare, and financial services. By investing in this multifaceted approach, the program strives to eliminate the need for long-term safety net services. A baseline survey was conducted for 2,400 households in October 2008, followed by the intervention. Two follow-up surveys were conducted in March-May 2012 and March-May 2013."
