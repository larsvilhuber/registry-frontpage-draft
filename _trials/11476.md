abstract: "Low-educated adults are underrepresented in adult education. At the same time, the current high-paced technological change shapes and stimulates demand for a labor force capable of constantly updating its skill set, which can result in a wedge between labor supply and demand if the supplied and demanded skill profiles grow apart. In a large-scale field experiment, we study if a financial incentive in the form of a scholarship increases enrollment in education among skilled adult workers."
