abstract: "Being resource scarce often leads to behaviors that reinforce and prolong the status of scarcity. Prior studies explained such suboptimal behavior under the hypothesis that scarcity directly impedes individualsâ€™ cognitive ability, leaving them with less capacity to make optimal economic decisions. To test the effects of cognitive load under states of scarcity and abundance, we conducted a controlled online experiment that separates scarcity (vs. abundance) and cognitive load (high vs. low) inducements using a real-incentivized 2 x 2 between-subject design. We evaluate the treatment effects on four economic decisions: propensity to cheat, risk preferences, time preferences, and monetary allocations. "
