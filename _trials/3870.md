abstract: "We will work with a population that is composed of Syrian refugees  and  Jordanian nationals residing in urban areas of Jordan. Jordan offers a unique opportunity to study refugees' integration in the labour market. While in many countries refugees do not have the right to work, or have to clear long bureaucratic hurdles before being granted such right,  Jordan has recently passed a series of reforms -- known as the Jordan Compact -- which give refugees the right to work in low-skilled formal jobs. However, since the introduction of the reform, formal employment rates among refugees have failed to grow as rapidly as expected. In this project, we will evaluate interventions that are tailored to removing the main obstacles refugees may encounter in the formal labour market."
