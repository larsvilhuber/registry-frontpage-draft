abstract: "Improving agricultural productivity remains a central challenge in many developing countries. Working together with a local NGO in northern India, this project seeks to study obstacles to the adoption of a novel vertical farming model, which enables the simultaneous cultivation of multiple crops. Despite its potential to significantly boost farm incomes, the baseline rate of adoption is low. An experiment over three years is designed to study the roles of financial frictions, as well as market access, in shaping adoption decisions, both in the cross section and over time."
