abstract: "Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of an Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM)  program conducted in Jordan on private providers' knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward an injectable contraceptive, Depot Medroxy Progesterone Acetate (DMPA).  
Design: A stratified randomized controlled study by region and gender. Computer generated random assignments allocated treatment and control groups.
Setting: Provider misconceptions and biases about contraceptive methods are major barriers to family planning access for women in low- and middle-income countries, including Jordan. Evidence-Based Medicine programs aim to reduce biases and misconceptions by providing doctors with the most up-to-date scientific evidence on contraceptive methods. Study was conducted December 2011 to January 2013. 
Participants: 267 private doctors providing family planning services in Amman and Zarqa regions in Jordan. 
Intervention: The treatment group was invited to attend a roundtable seminar on the injectable contraceptive DMPA, and to receive two 15 minute one-on-one educational visits that reinforce the messages from the seminar. The control group received two educational visits on the previous year's material on Combined Oral Contraception pills and no information on DMPA. 
Main outcome measures: Providers' knowledge of DMPA, attitudes towards DMPA, self-perceived confidence level, and reported clinical practice.
Results: 267 providers randomized (treatment group n= 135; control group n= 132). 38 providers excluded because they did not complete an endline survey leaving 229 doctors (treatment group n = 117 ; control group n = 112) for intention to treat analysis. No significant impact of the EBM program on knowledge of DMPA's side effects (point estimates -0.02) or on reported clinical practices (point estimates -0.01). Attitude and Confidence Scores of providers in the treatment group are 0.14 and 0.21 standard deviations higher (respectively) compared to the control group, but not statistically significant. Evidence shows positive selection into program participation.  
Conclusions: EBM may not be effective as a stand-alone program targeting a family planning method with a high level of provider and consumer bias. Evidence of positive selection into program participation underscores the importance of randomization to avoid overestimating the true effects of interventions.
