abstract: "This study investigates the impact of feedback-associated experience on motivated memory in the context of an IQ test. Previous research has shown that individuals tend to remember favorable feedback better and unfavorable feedback worse, which may give rise to self-serving biases. However, little is known about how personal experiences with feedback affect false memory formation. In my experiment, I compare the incidence of memory errors between two treatments: one with feedback-associated experience and one without. The study aims to identify the pure effect of feedback-associated experience on motivated false memory and explore individual heterogeneity in the impact of feedback-associated experience. The findings contribute to the understanding of the motivational value of feedback-associated experience and its influence on strategic memory management."
