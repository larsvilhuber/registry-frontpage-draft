abstract: "Background and aims
Digital technologies have the potential to address some challenges in providing high-quality and equitable health care services. In particular, telemedicine service can overcome geographical barriers and provide health service/training to residents/healthcare workers in remote and undeveloped areas. Previous studies have documented poor quality of primary health care in rural areas of China. This study aims to assess whether a telemedicine-based training program could improve the quality of care delivered by primary healthcare providers in rural areas and what influences rural primary healthcare providers’ engagement in the program.

Who can participate?
First, we identified rural primary healthcare providers who were practicing Western medicine in the 40 sample townships. In each township, we randomly selected 3 doctors in the township health center and included all of the doctors from 3 randomly selected villages. These doctors were included in our trial and are hereafter referred to as “sample primary healthcare providers”.

In addition, for each selected village, we randomly selected 5 households. Residents aged 18 or older in these households (hereafter, “sample rural residents”) were surveyed. Thus, a total of 15 households was selected in each township for investigation.

What does the study involve?
Following a baseline survey, 40 townships in our trial were randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group. In the intervention group, sample primary healthcare providers were offered the opportunity to participate in a telemedicine-based training program for 7 months (see descriptions in the Intervention section below). Sample primary healthcare providers in the control group did not receive any intervention. Within three months after the training program ended, sample primary healthcare providers were followed up to assess their clinical knowledge and practices, and sample rural residents were followed up to assess patient satisfaction, utilization of primary medical services, their own health behavior and knowledge, as well as health services provided by doctors in their village clinic and township health center.

What are the possible benefits and risks of participating? 
This study is expected to benefit rural primary healthcare providers and residents in the townships randomly assigned to the intervention group. Potential benefits to primary healthcare providers include improved clinical knowledge. Rural residents served by primary healthcare providers in the intervention group may benefit from improved care. There are no risks involved in participating in this study."
