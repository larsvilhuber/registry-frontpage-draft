abstract: "To increase service membersâ€™ awareness of well-matched, affordable colleges and universities and to support them to make informed decisions about whether and where to pursue postsecondary education, we designed and tested a large-scale experiment to provide service members separating from the U.S. Army with personalized and simplified information, reminders, and advising about their college and university options."
