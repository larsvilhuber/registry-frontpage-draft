abstract: "We recruit local politicians in Nepal for a phone survey to test whether their personal experiences, and especially participation in the Nepal People’s War, affect their political views and policy priorities. First, participants are randomized into three groups: i) participants in the control group are not asked to reflect on the link between their personal experiences and policy priorities; ii) participants in the “personal experiences prime” treatment group are asked to reflect on how their personal experiences affect their policy priorities, without any specific mention of the civil war; and finally, iii) participants in the “civil war prime” treatment group are asked to reflect on their personal experiences during the civil war and how these affect their policy priorities. We then measure participants’ policy goals, preferences for redistribution, opinions over targeting strategies related to social protection (avoiding exclusion or inclusion errors, and use of in-kind versus cash transfers), support for federalism, and opinions about political inclusion, and test whether their political views and policy priorities are affected by the control recollection of past personal experiences."
