abstract: "We propose a complete decomposition of the trust game keeping the measurement context of the underlying behavioural drivers of trust constant. We field this design with a large sample representative of the German population. We analyze the data using both non-paramatric approaches, and structural models using Bayesian hierarchical mothods.
