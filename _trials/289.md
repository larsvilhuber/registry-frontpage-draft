abstract: "This project explores how workers respond to information about their position in the wage distribution of peers in the economy. We work together with a nationwide survey website in the Netherlands to implement a survey experiment. We ask all respondents about where they think they are in the wage distribution of peers in the economy. Next, we provide a random half of the respondents information about their 'true' position in the relevant wage distribution (using data recently gathered by the survey website). We compare job satisfaction, intention to quit current job, and willingness to exert effort of employees who are informed by us with those who are not. Moreover, we investigate how an employee's reciprocal inclinations and the presence of efficiency wage policies in the employee's workplace influence the treatment effects. Lastly, we examine one possible framing effect. "
