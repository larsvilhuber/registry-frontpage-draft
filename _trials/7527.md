abstract: "The aim of this research project is to examine the impact of negative future priming on individual pro-environmental behavior (PEB). Priming can temporarily make a particular context more salient, causing a personâ€™s behavior to lean more toward the norms associated with the salient context. We will examine whether participants who have been primed on a negative future behave more pro-environmentally friendly in a new incentivized decision task. In addition, we aim to investigate how observed priming effects persist. "
