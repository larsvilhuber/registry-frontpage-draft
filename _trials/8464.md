abstract: "ideas42 is partnering with the World Bank and Government of Ghana to introduce behavioral designs into the Complementary Livelihood and Asset Support Scheme (CLASS). The objective of CLASS is to support productive inclusion activities for extremely poor households. Under CLASS, beneficiaries are provided with life skills, microenterprise, business management and vocational skills training, as well as microenterprise coaching and mentoring. They are also given start up cash grants up to a maximum of $200 to set up their own microenterprises. CLASS beneficiaries are selected from either the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) cash transfer program, or from the Labor-Intensive Public Works (LIPW) public works program. All three programs are run as components of the Ghana Productive Safety Net Program (GPSNP), aimed at supporting the government to strengthen safety net systems and improve the productive inclusion of the poor. 

ideas42 is working closely with the World Bank and the Government of Ghana to co-design behaviorally-informed interventions aimed at aiding beneficiaries in translating their intention to start and grow successful income generating activities into action. Furthermore, ideas42 will work with the Government of Ghana to implement a rigorous impact assessment of the behaviorally-informed designs with the aim of improving the effectiveness of the behavioral interventions, and informing their incorporation into the GPSNP at scale."
