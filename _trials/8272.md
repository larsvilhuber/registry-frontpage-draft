abstract: "We conduct an online survey experiment providing information about vaccines from different manufacturers of COVID-19 to subjects below 20 years old in Taiwan. We provide the subjects information sheets about the vaccines from different manufacturers, which include information such as efficacy, safety, and the platform that the vaccines use. Then we see how the subjects update their beliefs about the vaccines and how their preferences on different vaccines change. In order to identify the effect in belief updating of following two factors (1) the self-selection in consumption of information and (2) the motivated updating from information, we designed 3 treatments: (A) allowing subject to freely choose which and how many information sheet to read, (B) allow subjects to choose a fixed amount of information to read, and (C) assign a fixed amount of information sheets for subjects to read.
