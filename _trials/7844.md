abstract: "We conducted a mask promotion program to reduce the spread of SARS-Cov-2 in Uganda that was implemented in partnership with the Office of Prime Minister and the Ministry of Health in Uganda. The study involves evaluation of a national program that aimed to provide a free mask to all citizens 6 years or older in Uganda. We combined provision of free masks with educational and behavioral interventions informed by behavioral economics insights. The goal of this pilot program is to understand reasons for low mask adoption, and to help guide policy makers in Uganda and beyond in pursuit of potential scale-ups. This pre-analysis plan outlines the study design and intervention, the main outcomes of interest and the primary methods of analysis for evaluating this program."
