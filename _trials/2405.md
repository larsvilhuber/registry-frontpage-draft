abstract: "Can employment and entrepreneurship in poorly developed nations be fostered using educational training programs? Do such programs foster the psychological well-being of participants? And, finally, does an increase in employment and entrepreneurship change the willingness of individuals to voice political dissent in an authoritarian regime? We approach these questions by evaluating a large-scale educational youth employment program implemented by the International Youth Foundation (IYF) in Zimbabwe."
