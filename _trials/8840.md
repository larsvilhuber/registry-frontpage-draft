abstract: "Policy makers around the world have revised and aligned their education systems to better prepare students with the necessary skills required in the 21st century. These skills go beyond traditional subjects such as reading and mathematics and include creativity, communication, collaboration, entrepreneurship, grit and resilience, among others. Music education has gained attention for fostering skills and attitudes different from musical areas of cognition, aligned with 21st century skills. Several studies have identified the positive impact of music education on empathy, neuroplasticity, intelligence, development of spatial–temporal abilities and socio-emotional skills.  The study “Experimental Evaluation of Pilot Program for Universal Music Education in Colombia”, has the purpose of  conducting an experimental assessment of a pilot music program in Colombia (Producción y Emprendimiento Musical) on how music principals (fundamentals), music production (use of technologies and free software to create music) and the business of music (the role of entrepreneurship in the music and creative industries) could lead to enhance and improve 21st century skills in young participants. A second arm of the program will have a soft-skills training curriculum called DecidoSer Campeón, in addition to the music program and we will evaluate how the music training is enhanced by life skills education. IRB application is was submitted in January 2022 and is pending approval."
