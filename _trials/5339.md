abstract: "The prisoner’s dilemma game has the deeply discouraging implication that cooperation will be impossible to achieve in one-time encounters. Fortunately, players in the real world have found ways to engage in cooperative endeavors in just such situations. Here we argue that parties can solve this dilemma through a two-step tatonnement process where they first pledge their intentions. A deal is reached if there is reciprocal agreement on the pledges and breaking one’s word is more costly than merely not cooperating. 
Our analysis accomplishes two goals: First, using traditional game-theoretic tools, we demonstrate that cooperation emerges naturally as a subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) in a pledge-and-agree framework. Often it is the only SPE; in other contexts, its properties make it the logical choice among SPEs. Second, this analysis employs experiments to test whether parties actually reach cooperative outcomes when allowed to pledge and agree before taking action."
