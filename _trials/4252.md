abstract: "We seek to identify the effects of providing district-level average student achievement information and/or average student growth information on participants’ attitudes towards the public schools in their community. By achievement, we refer to students’ average academic performance at the end of one period of time. By growth, we refer to students’ average rate of improvement in academic performance over the same period of time. This project consists of an online experiment embedded in a nationally representative survey of Americans' attitudes towards education issues."
