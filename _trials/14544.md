abstract: "This project aims to understand how people form beliefs about the macroeconomy, particularly developments in inflation and house prices. We propose that memories of past experiences, both relevant and potentially irrelevant, shape these beliefs. Suppose an individual is forecasting whether the inflation rate over the next twelve months will be high (i.e., above a certain threshold). We argue that the individual will rely, in part, on past experiences that have some similarity to the hypothesis they are trying to imagine (elevated levels of inflation). Our theory proposes that individuals who have personal experience with very similar things – for instance, financial struggles – will have an easier time imagining a future with higher levels of inflation, boosting their estimates of the likelihood of it occurring. We will run a controlled experiment that investigates these memory mechanisms, exploring how exogenously varying which past (similar but objectively irrelevant) experiences “come to mind” impacts beliefs about the likelihood of future macroeconomic events. We are also interested in whether elicited similarity ranks are stable over time, both at the individual and aggregate levels. Moreover, we want to analyze whether priming the same experience in this second survey complements (reinforces) or substitutes (weakens) the original intervention on beliefs.  This will shed light on the relative strength of different memory forces. We will also examine recall errors by comparing recollections of primed experiences in the second survey with their corresponding recollections from the first survey."
