abstract: "This project investigates the causes of under-reporting for college sexual assault by examining the impacts of both a survey technique designed to provide plausible deniability and the salience of social norms on reporting rates. I designed a 2x2 online survey experiment in which subjects complete two primary tasks on social norms and experience with sexual assault. In the social norm task, subjects complete an incentivized social norm elicitation exercise, where they predict the percentage of previous survey respondents (men and women) who agree with statements suggesting that women reporting sexual assault are partly responsible for what happened or are lying about the assault. In the experience task, subjects complete binary questions on their experience with either sexual assault perpetration or victimization. I vary: 1) whether survey responses on victimization and perpetration are recorded using direct elicitation or “hard-garbling,” and 2) the order in which subjects complete the two tasks. I assess the impacts of the survey technique and of the salience of social norms, as proxied by whether subjects complete the social norm task first or second, on reporting rates and investigate the level of misperception of social norms."
