abstract: "This study constitutes the second wave of our panel study on the role of social identity and ``groupiness'' in the demand for and processing of information using an online experiment with a representative sample of the US population. The first wave was deployed the week before the 2020 US presidential election, where 1,004 participants played a set of games and predicted both the outcomes of the 2020 presidential election and policy-sensitive statistics a year after the election conditional on its outcome. In Wave 2, we will explore the mechanisms behind participants' biased information demand and processing uncovered in Wave 1. Specifically, participants will again play the other-other allocation games as well as a variant of ``guessing which cup is used'', which measures the individual ingroup bias in information demand and processing in a neutral domain. We also administer a short survey to evaluate whether the election outcomes have led to any perceptions of status change among the Democrats and Republicans. In a treatment variation, we test whether informing participants that the quality of information is independent of party labels causes a reduction of ingroup bias in information demand and processing."
