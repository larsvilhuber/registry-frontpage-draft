abstract: "When the means to an end are scarce, decisions makers focus their attention, using available resources most effectively. However, this increased focus comes at a cost. Decision makers lose oversight and neglect important but less pressing long-term projects. They borrow too much and overall performance decreases as a consequence. Until now, this research has concentrated on individual decision makers. We study how scarcity affects borrowing decisions in groups. Do groups also neglect long-term projects under scarcity? Do groups borrow to meet the needs of the present, and thereby compromise the ability to meet their needs in the future, to the same extent as individuals do? Our experimental design builds directly on the 4th experiment of Shah et al (Science, 338 (6107): 682-685, 2012). We replicate their experiment and add three treatments where one player can borrow time from another player."
