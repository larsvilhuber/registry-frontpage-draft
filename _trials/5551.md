abstract: "This study examines the relationship between mobility and women's female labor force participation and empowerment in Saudi Arabia.  The researchers use a Randomized Controlled Trial to examine the impact of treatments designed to increase mobility, including subsidies for ride-sharing and assistance with obtaining a driving license.  This will allow the team to quantify how female mobility affects labor market outcomes for female employees and jobseekers, and ultimately womenâ€™s empowerment.
