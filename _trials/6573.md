abstract: "The use of cryptocurrencies involves specific risks including high volatility, cybertheft, and lack of regulation. Considering their potential to destabilize the financial system, authorities have an interest in efficient regulation of cryptocurrencies. Official warnings form the lowest threshold in the spectrum of possible regulatory procedures. At the same time, central banks around the world consider the issuance of their own cryptocurrencies – called central bank digital currency (CBDC) – which may combine the advantages of blockchain technology and legal tender. The success of any currency strongly depends on the adoption by consumers. Using a survey experiment, we investigate the impact of official warnings on the attitudes towards Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, and central bank digital money."
