abstract: "To study idea evaluation and selection within firms, we conduct a field experiment in cooperation with a large multinational company in the information and communication technology (ICT) sector. The field experiment aims to provide causal evidence on how the relationship between idea proposers and idea evaluators affects evaluation and ultimately innovation outcomes. To do so, we manipulate the idea evaluation process where innovation managers rate ideas proposed by their colleagues. Specifically, we experimentally vary the amount of information that innovation managers receive on the idea proposer. There are two conditions: (1) non-blind evaluation, where innovation managers receive information on the name, organizational unit, and location of the idea proposer, and (2) blind evaluation, where innovation managers receive no information on the idea proposer. We intend to analyze how blind evaluation changes evaluation scores (H1 - Rating) and how the effect depends on order (H2 - Order). Moreover, we want to test how blind evaluation changes evaluation scores when the idea proposer is female (H3 - Gender), when the idea proposer comes from the same organizational unit as the evaluator (H4 - Subunit), and when the idea proposer is located in the same country as the evaluator (H5 - Location)."
