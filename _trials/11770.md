abstract: "We set out to determine if self-directed learning with Twitter improves point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) image interpretation competency by conducting a multicentered, randomized controlled trial. Participants are randomized to either follow generic medical accounts or POCUS education accounts on Twitter. They complete a baseline multiple-choice assessment, log their Twitter use every 3 weeks for 3 months, then complete a post-intervention assessment. Data is logged by digital survey. The primary outcome is the change in assessment scores pre and post which we will compare between the control (generic medical accounts) and intervention (POCUS accounts) groups. Educational content is widely available on social media networks, but this study will be the first randomized controlled trial analyzing whether social media medical education translates to improvements in POCUS competency."
