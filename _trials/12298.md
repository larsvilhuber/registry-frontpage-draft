abstract: "Our study will conduct a number of survey experiments to investigate the accuracy of different approaches widely used to estimate the prevalence of sensitive behavior in the social sciences.The context of the study is tax compliance in a sample of small- to mid-sized enterprises in Kampala, Uganda. By combining survey data with administrative tax records for the same firms, we assess the performance of different measurement approaches, benchmarked against the administrative data, within the same survey. This allows us to quantify measurement error in different self-reported measures of tax compliance and make recommendations for policy and research based on our findings."
