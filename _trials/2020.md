abstract: "Although peer effects have been documented in a variety of contexts, little is known about the role played by peer characteristics in mediating those effects. Are people more likely to follow those most similar to them? If so, along what dimensions does similarity matter most? We study this question in the context of peer mentoring for smoking cessation, delivered by former smokers through a text-messaging platform. The platform serves as the basis for a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness and appeal of peer mentoring for smoking cessation. The experiment will include about 200 U.S. adult smokers who will be randomly assigned to a peer mentor or not. Participants in the control group will receive automated text messages used in SmokefreeTXT, a nationwide text-messaging service sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in which users receive one to five automated messages per day for up to eight weeks. Smokers in the treatment group will receive a modified version of the same automated messages, but with additional personalized messages from a randomly assigned peer mentor. Mentors will provide responses to specific questions or comments a smoker may have after receiving the automated messages. The intervention will last 8 weeks. Our study has two aims. First, we analyze smokersâ€™ preferences for peer mentors to understand which mentor characteristics matter most to them and to investigate the role played by similarity in shaping their preferences. Second, we study whether having a peer mentor similar to themselves and/or close to their own preferences affects (i) their engagement; and (ii) their performance as measured by their quit status."
