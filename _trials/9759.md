abstract: " Most food consumed in developing countries is transacted in informal markets. While these markets provide an important source of low cost food for the poor, they can also present food safety hazards. In Ghana and throughout West Africa, kulikuli is a popular snack food made from groundnuts. Because kulikuli is fried and spiced, it hides the morphology and taste of groundnuts likely to be contaminated with aflatoxin. Thus, poor quality and potentially hazard groundnuts (also traded informally) frequently end up in kulikuli. In this study we implement and evaluate a training program to teach kulikuli producers how to avoid and sort out potentially hazardous groundnuts before making kulikuli. As part of the program, we will test and rate producers' kulikuli and provide marketing materials for producers to signal that they have been trained and the safety of their kulikuli. The program will be complemented by an information intervention targeting local consumers. To evaluate the intervention we will conduct a market-level cluster randomized control trial with 720 kulikuli producers and 1440 consumers. We will evaluate the intervention's impact on producer and consumer behavior, as well as on food safety of locally available kulikuli."
