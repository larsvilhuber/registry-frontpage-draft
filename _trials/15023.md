abstract: "The goal of the field experiment is to create a data-generating process to structurally identify students' decision-making processes, which include preferences, production, and cost functions modeled as a function of peer learning in a competitive environment. Thus, the ultimate goal is to provide counterfactual simulations for an optimal design of competitive forces interacting with peer matching and learning. The data-generating process is inspired by Cotton et al. (2024) in that I use a website tool that includes a novel feature allowing student collaboration. Students are asked to use this website during an interim period, starting with a baseline exam and survey, followed by an endline exam and survey. The website usage allows data collection on effort choices, both individual and collaborative, in response to the competitive forces imposed by the prize structure in the final exam. I aim to use baseline and endline exams, as well as student-reported academic backgrounds, to estimate the model where the input comes from the website data, including the number of quizzes solved, daily time spent, and the number of chat messages exchanged within a pair."
