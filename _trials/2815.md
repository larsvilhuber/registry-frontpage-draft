abstract: "Pakistan has low student learning levels and educator motivation, and accountability is a pervasive problem. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Elementary and Secondary Education (E&SE) Department wants to improve learning by increasing teacher accountability through the reform of two dysfunctional accountability systems. The first is the system of ‘annual confidential reports’ for teachers. These evaluations were conducted at the end of the calendar year (overlapping two school years), performed by head teachers who find it difficult to criticize colleagues, and did not include teaching-specific measures known to improve learning. Moreover, although in theory evaluation scores should be tied to promotion, in practice promotions have been based on seniority, educational qualifications, and/or political connections. The second source of dysfunction is the system of school inspections. Head teachers face school inspections, but they are irregular, unstructured, and results are often unreported. Thus, neither system currently motivates effort. 

During the 2017/8 school year, the research team, alongside the KP E&SE Department, is introducing two new accountability systems with the aim of motivating educator effort and improving student learning outcomes. The first is the Annual Teacher Evaluation (ATE), which aims to address previous shortcomings in a number of ways. It covers the school rather than calendar year, and so a single cohort of students. It focuses on teaching-specific outcomes—presence of the teacher and his/her students, the teacher’s pedagogy, and test scores of the teacher’s students. It is conducted by relatively more independent, district-level inspectors rather than colleagues from the same school. Finally, and crucially, teachers’ ATE scores are explicitly linked to career progression via promotion tournaments within districts; teachers who perform well relative to peers in similar schools are fast-tracked for promotion, while those who perform poorly are held back. 

The second new accountability system is the School Inspection Report (SIR). This school-level report is also undertaken by independent district inspectors and, in contrast to the previous system, is based on regular, structured site visits. Similar information is collected as for ATEs—presence of the head teacher, staff, and students within the school, and teacher pedagogy. The main difference compared to the ATE is that it is the head teacher’s career progression that is on the line; head teachers of schools that perform favourably compared to other schools in their circle (the equivalent of school district) are fast-tracked for promotion, while head teachers of schools that perform relatively poorly are held back. 

The study team is collaborating with the KP E&SE Department to undertake a randomized controlled trial of these two new accountability systems. The trial is funded by the International Growth Centre (IGC), the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the University of Oxford, and involves 240 rural, public primary schools in three districts in KP: Charsadda, Mardan, and Nowshera. There are three study arms, each with 80 schools: new ATE (teacher incentives), new SIR (head teacher incentives) and a ‘business-as-usual’ control. Both the ATE and SIR will be tied to promotion tournaments within circles (the equivalent of school districts). Twelve schools in each circle will participate in the study, 4 in each study arm. The study will provide the KP E&SE Department with an evidence base to assess whether strengthening of career incentives is an effective policy to motivate teacher effort and improve student learning outcomes.
