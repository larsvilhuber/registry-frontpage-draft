abstract: "Research on the effects of mindfulness – the awareness that arises from paying attention, on purpose, in the present moment and adopting a deliberately open, non-judgmental and impartial view toward one’s thoughts and feelings – suggests that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have the potential to increase individual well-being. At the same time, the cognitive effects of MBIs are less clear. This study investigates whether the effect of a short MBI influences the magnitude of priming and anchoring on a judgement task. "
