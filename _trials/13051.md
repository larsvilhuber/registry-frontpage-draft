abstract: "Does a training program for factory managers, supervisors, and workers lead to better performance and worker outcomes in factories that are planning to introduce a pay incentive system? We will also test whether any performance or worker outcomes are moderated by social norms deterring sexual harassment, rehumanization of workers, power dynamics, incentive pay, and accountability. We first looked at this question in a study of a management training program in Vietnam. Now we are looking at effects of both the manager training and a whole-workforce rehumanization training in factories in Bangladesh. We also plan to look at whether rehumanization of workers affects supervisors' information processing.
