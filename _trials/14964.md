abstract: "Through their ability to govern behaviour rules can foster large scale cooperation by promoting socially beneficial behaviour. The CRISP (Gaechter, Molleman and Nosenzo, 2024) framework captures key psychological factors (Respect for Rules, Incentives, Social Expectations, Social Preferences) underpinning rule compliance and cooperation. We conduct within-subject experiments to study the relationships between these fundamental psychological underpinnings of cooperation and rule compliance. We focus primarily on the role respect for rules, social expectations, and social preferences play in driving personally costly rule following and voluntary cooperation."
