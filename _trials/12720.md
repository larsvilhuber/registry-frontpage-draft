abstract: "Why women underperform relative to men in high-stakes exams while excelling under lower stakes remains a puzzle. Previous research suggests differential responses to pressure as an explanation. We evaluate the impact of a unique intervention assigning STEM program applicants in Uruguay to in-exam stress management exercises involving positive stress interpretation and a brief meditation. The 2023 intervention was implemented by Ceibal, the agency in charge of the program. In 2024, we partner with Ceibal to collect a new wave of data. We will evaluate the impact of the same intervention with the population of applicants to the program, who will be women only in 2024. The  2024 intervention contains three treatment arms, randomly assigned within the 4 versions of the online test that applicants take to be considered for admission. The treatment arms, including the order of the test subjects, are as follows: T1 (Stress reappraisal exercise, verbal, math, meditation, concentration, logic); T2 (Stress reappraisal exercise, math, verbal, meditation, concentration, logic), C (Verbal, math, concentration, logic). We collect a series of survey questions at the end of the test to shed light on mechanisms."
