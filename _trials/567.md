abstract: "How to stimulate demand for HIV prevention at relatively low costs and how to target those at high risk of getting infected by the disease are common concerns in most HIV prevention programs. We present evidence from a two-year field experiment in which individuals were offered relatively low monetary incentives (in expectations) conditional on testing negative for two curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs), but where the transfer were given in the form of a lottery ticket with a chance of winning a high price. The intervention resulted in a large reduction in HIV incidence and prevalence in the treatment as compared to the control group. Lottery incentives appear to be particularly effective in targeting individuals with ex ante risky sexual behavior, consistent with the hypothesis that lotteries are more valued by risk-willing individuals and these individuals are also more likely to engage in risky sex.
