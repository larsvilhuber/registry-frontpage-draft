abstract: "Strong future-time reference (=strong-FTR) languages (e.g. English) require a dedicated marking of the future (e.g. in English with “will” or “going to”), while weak future-time reference (=weak-FTR) languages (e.g. German) do not require to mark the future. Previous research suggests that strong-FTR languages make the future feel more distant than the present, implying that more short-term-oriented behavior occurs in areas such as saving and health. The aim of this research project is to examine the causal effect of the linguistic structure on individual pro-environmental behavior (PEB) within a weak-FTR language (German). More specifically, we will take advantage of the German language in which speakers can freely choose whether or not to use the future tense when talking about future events. In a between-subject online experiment, we will manipulate the use of future time referencing (weak-FTR vs. strong-FTR, respectively present tense vs. future tense marking) in order to examine its effect on pro-environmental behavior. We will elicit subjects’ pro-environmental behavior using a new incentivized decision task in which individuals can decide whether to invest money to plant trees or keep it for themselves. "
