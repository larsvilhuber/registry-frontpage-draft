abstract: "In this study, we evaluated the impact of the introduction of Artificial Intelligence technology in the correction of Portuguese essays on students' writing skills. To do so, teachers in three municipalities in the state of Alagoas, a poor state in Brazil, were randomly assigned to access an online platform for three months.  This platform allows teachers to upload essay texts produced by students, giving back to the teachers the students' performance in four aspects of writing skills: formal writing register, cohesion, thematic coherence, and textual typology. The objective of the experiment is to verify whether there has been an improvement in the quality of textual production of primary school students.
