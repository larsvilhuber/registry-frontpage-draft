abstract: "Default selections are effective at encouraging desired choices among respondents, but may restrict autonomy if respondents are unaware of the default selection or its purpose. Transparency when deploying default selections may be a solution. Evidence suggests that transparent defaults may increase the effectiveness of default selections by increasing the perception that the endorser is fair and trustworthy or providing justification for the preferred choice. This study will test whether presenting a transparent default choice increases survey respondent sign-up for future surveys. The goal of this study is to learn whether disclosing the purpose of a default selection affects the choice to be contacted for future surveys."
