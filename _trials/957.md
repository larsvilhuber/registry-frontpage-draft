abstract: "This study aims to evaluate the impact of the Human Development Cash Transfer (HDCT) program in Madagascar. The program will be implemented as a randomized control trial (RCT) beginning in December 2015 and will provide cash transfers to eligible poor households for three years.  Households will be eligible for a conditional cash transfer if they have primary school aged children and eligible for an unconditional cash transfer if they have children who are not yet eligible to enroll in primary school. Additionally the program incorporates a “Mother Leader” (ML) component, in which beneficiaries democratically elect a group member to lead monthly health, child development and citizenship training sessions. Behaviorally-informed nudges are designed to enhance the effects of the program. The program is designed as a multi-level RCT with the cash transfer being randomized at an aggregate level, the commune (third-level administrative divisions of Madagascar), and the ML and nudges being randomized at a lower level of the village unit, the fokontany. We seek to measure effects of the treatments on household economic well-being, child health, and educational outcomes."
