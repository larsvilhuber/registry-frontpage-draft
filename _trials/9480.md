abstract: "In this study, we ask whether structural transformation in the form of movement from agriculture into non-agriculture can be incentivized and study the consequences for the demand for agricultural land – the primary cause of natural habitat and biodiversity loss worldwide. Specifically, we ask whether we can persistently draw young farmers out of agriculture in areas in North Kivu where agricultural activity conflicts with biodiversity conservation led by the Virunga National Park (VNP) and study the possible implications for land use. In a randomised control trial, we test whether offering young farmers a guaranteed fixed-term urban job can induce them to migrate and take up non-agricultural work. We compare the effects of this policy incentive to a short-term daily work scheme, which does not require farmers to move away from their villages. A third group of farmers receive nothing in the study. We also cross-randomise a short environmental education session across all three arms. We measure whether these incentives increase non-agricultural employment and reduce demand for agricultural land. "
