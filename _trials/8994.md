abstract: "In a field experiment with a mobile digital lender in southern Africa, we offer repayment plans (breaking down a full repayment into four equal installments) and future loan eligibility (conditional on repayment) to delinquent borrowers. Using a 2x2 experimental design and administrative data from the lender, we identify the causal impact of each intervention, along with their interactive impact, on repayment rates
and future credit-seeking and repayment behavior. Using baseline and endline phone surveys, we also identify impacts on borrower well-being, beliefs about the value of credit, and overall financial inclusion."
