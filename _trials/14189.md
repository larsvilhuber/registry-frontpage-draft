abstract: "Children with incarcerated parents are much more likely to underperform in school and experience poverty. Children who move to communities with higher incarceration rates are at much greater risk of being convicted of a felony themselves upon becoming an adult. In short, the children of adults that have so recently been incarcerated at scale will soon be the ones at risk. Effective programming for children of incarcerated parents could potentially short-circuit this cycle, but rigorous research on such programs is very limited.

This study will measure the causal effect of intensive, multi-dimensional services for children with incarcerated parents. We focus on the programming of Kidz2Leaders (K2L), an Atlanta-area program that provides multiple years of faith-based summer camp, internship placements, and holistic family support. The program is intense and of lengthy duration: The median participant attends camp for 6 years. Even outside of camp, K2L spends over a thousand dollars on family support services per camper per year. To measure the effectiveness of this programming, we will implement a prospective randomized controlled trial. The randomized controlled trial relies on the fact that K2L’s initial summer camp has excess demand for spots that are limited by bed space and staffing.

We will enroll 600 participants through K2L’s existing summer camp application process. We will use administrative records to measure educational outcomes and, eventually, contact with the criminal justice system as adults. We will supplement administrative data with sub-sample surveys covering school districts not represented in the available records. Using this combination of outcome data, we expect to be able to detect a 12 percentage point decrease in the likelihood of a school behavior incident within 3 years, a 24% decrease relative to a base rate of 51%.
