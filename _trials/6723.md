abstract: "Though sustainable food consumption plays a key role for a responsible management of the resources of the earth and global society, consumers do not increase the consumption thereof. In the literature consumers’ characteristics influencing the purchasing intentions of sustainable products have been widely examined. However, the role of information content and sources as catalysts to increase valuation of sustainable foods is not well established. Thus, the objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of information provision for consumers’ valuation of sustainable foods, here ethical labeled products. We will conduct an online survey with a sample of 2500 consumers representative to the German population in terms of gender, age, income, and education starting in November 2020. Within the online survey, respondents are randomly assigned to either one of the five information treatments or to the control group. We use the contingent valuation approach to measure the willingness-to-pay premium for a chocolate bar with the Fairtrade label compared to a similar conventional chocolate bar. Related outcomes capture the purchasing intentions of the participants as well as perception of source and information of the provided information treatment. "
