abstract: "We designed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) where we integrate a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to estimate the causal effects of providing information on students’ preferences for higher education (HE). This new approach illuminates not only which HE attributes are more likely to play a role in students’ decisions, but also whether it is possible to modify students´ choices by means of information. Schools are randomized in one control and two treatment groups. The intervention consisted of providing information on general facts regarding HE. In addition, the information provided to treatment group 1 emphasized financial returns and enrollment rates in accredited universities, whereas for treatment group 2 emphasized financial aid and university costs in accredited universities.
