abstract: "Introducing more advanced technologies into firms holds the promise of elevating job quality and productivity, fostering higher wages and more efficient societal outputs. However, in developing countries, data on how technology adoption influences factors such as employment rates and wages remain sparse. To bridge this gap, our study focuses on the textile sector in Burundi, where most small firms rely solely on manual
sewing machines. Through a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we will equip selected firms with automatic sewing machines and offer operation training. Our analysis will track short-term (3 months) and long-term (9 months) effects on three key variables: employment, productivity, and real wages.
