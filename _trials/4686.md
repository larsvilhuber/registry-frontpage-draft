abstract: "This analysis, part of a broader study called Building Evidence on Employment Strategies (BEES), is an extension of the Breaking Barriers San Diego evaluation.  Breaking Barriers is a San Diego-based program that provided employment services to low-income individuals with a range of disabilities and conditions, using the Individual Placement and Support approach. The program operated in four locations in San Diego county from January 2016 through June 2018. MDRC used a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the program. Between January 2016 and early November 2017, individuals eligible for and interested in receiving Breaking Barriers services were assigned at random to a treatment group, which was offered Breaking Barriers services, or to a control group, which was referred to other publicly available supports. A total of 1,061 individuals enrolled in the study. The initial analysis used data collected through a 15-month follow-up survey administered to the study sample.  The main outcomes to be measured as part of the study extension include number of quarters employed and total earnings in the two years following random assignment.  "
