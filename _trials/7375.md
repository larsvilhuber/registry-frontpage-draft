abstract: "What incentive mechanism can effectively encourage people to establish good habits? We use the method of field experiment, and take exercise habits as the point of departure to study this issue. In particular, our subjects are university students, and we explore the influence of different incentive mechanisms on the frequency of students participating in sports. We mainly focus on non-monetary incentives.
