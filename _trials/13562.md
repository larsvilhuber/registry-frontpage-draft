abstract: "This study aims to expand the knowledge into the efficacy of light touch interventions as tools for promoting more pro-social attitudes towards migrants framed in a long-term goal of cultural change. Specifically, two interventions in video format are tested: one focused on the perspective-taking approach, which posits that individuals envisioning themselves from others' standpoints can reduce negative attitudes towards the other group, and social categorization, which argues that people tend to hold more positive attitudes towards other groups when perceiving them as less heterogeneous.
