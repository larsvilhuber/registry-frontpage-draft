abstract: "The purpose of the present study is to estimate the effect of a low-cost intervention (either one of two versions of a digitally disseminated message) on the subsequent tax compliance of Swedish taxpayers. The population consists of taxpayers who, according to automatically exchanged data from tax agencies abroad (CRS-data), had foreign dividends or interest from any of the three neighbouring countries Norway, Finland, or Denmark, during the tax year 2020. Within the CRS, tax authorities obtain information from financial institutions in their own jurisdiction and automatically exchange that information with other jurisdictions on an annual basis."
