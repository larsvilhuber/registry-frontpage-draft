abstract: "This randomized controlled trial (RCT) randomizes middle school students to watch one of the video-recorded interviews with two role models.  A growing body of literature has focused on the impact of role models and their underlying mechanisms. The aim of this RCT is to study the marginal effects of different content shared by the role models or the marginal effects of disclosing information about the role models on their role aspirants. 

Besides student test scores, this study collects student beliefs about gender and ability, aspirations, behaviors (efforts spent on study, school absence, confidence in achieving goals), and subjective well-being. This study also invites students' parents and head teachers to participate in a baseline survey. Therefore, this study aims to explore the changes in mechanisms due to different content shared by role models, or different information revealed about role models. "
