abstract: "The education system in Pakistan is characterized by low average learning and high learning inequality, both of which have been aggravated by COVID-19 related school closures. In other contexts, targeted instruction programs that tailor teaching content to students' actual learning levels have proven effective in raising learning, however these programs have often required costly additional teaching resources. To better scale targeted instruction, we test whether a low cost technology support tool can assist teachers in implementing the program without extra human inputs. We also explore whether the benefit of this technology is heterogeneous across teachers, and whether teachers who can benefit most from the tool self-select into using it immediately or after a trial period."
