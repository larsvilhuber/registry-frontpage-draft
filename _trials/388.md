abstract: "The Ultra Poor Graduation Pilot in Yemen is a part of the CGAP/Ford Foundation graduation initiative, implemented in eight countries, that combines safety net programs with livelihood activities as a pathway for the poorest households to move out of extreme poverty. In 2010, we conducted a baseline survey on 1009 ultra-poor households in 50 communities in the Governorates of Taiz, Lahj, and Aden in Yemen. The households were identified by our local partner, the Social Fund for Development (SFD), working with the Social Welfare Fund. After administration of the baseline survey, public lotteries were held to randomly select households to receive the intervention. The treatment households received an intensive support package including: livelihood training, productive asset transfer, consumption support (stipend), training on savings, and visits by field workers. By investing in this multifaceted approach, the program strives to eliminate the need for long-term safety net services. The endline survey for this project is scheduled for summer 2014."
