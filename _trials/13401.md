abstract: "When mean beliefs about men and women are elicited, often there is very little difference. But in line with previous literature on perceived variance of men vs. women, we aim to investigate whether the extremes of belief distributions over performance inform hiring decisions. Our laboratory experiment is designed to first test whether men and women are hired disproportionately for jobs with different expectations of performance. Additionally, we elicit beliefs about the variance of men and women's performance in order to determine whether the shape of belief distributions gives insight into why we might see a gender gap in hiring."
