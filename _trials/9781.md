abstract: "In this study, we estimate the effect of information disclosure on credit choices. In an online survey experiment, participants must choose whether they want to borrow using a consumer loan. For each hypothetical choice, the interest rate can take one of three possible values and the borrowing amount can take four possible values. We have three treatments: i) participants are shown the borrowing amount and interest rate only, ii) in addition, participants are shown the euro value of the interest they would pay if they do not pay off their debt for one month, or iii) in addition, they are shown the annual interest amount if they do not make any payments for one year."
