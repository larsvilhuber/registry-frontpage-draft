abstract: "Women face many challenges in conflict affected regions to maintaining economically sustainable self-employment activities. This evaluation builds off an existing yearlong womenâ€™s empowerment program that provides small business training and a monthly stipend to women in two conflict affected states of Nigeria.  We test the impacts of additional interventions: a six-month mentorship intervention (individually and group based) and support in forming and maintaining village level savings and loan groups (VSLAs).  Through random assignment of the interventions, we test whether they are able to boost economic outcomes for women in the program.  Due to delays in data collection as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we also explore whether the impacts from these interventions can be sustained over a challenging year of pandemic hardship.  "
