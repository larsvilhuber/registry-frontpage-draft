abstract: "Affect labelling, the process of putting feelings into words, has been shown to have a calming effect on the brain. This study examines the impact of affect labelling on political polarization over Covid-mitigation measures, an emotionally-charged topic that led to large differences of opinion. We conducted an online experiment in which participants in a treatment group, randomly assigned, underwent a questionnaire to label their feelings before reporting their opinions.  We found that affect labeling reduced polarization for young individuals, up to the age of 29, a demographic characterized by intense emotional responses due to increased activity in the amygdala, the region of the brain whose activity is reduced by affect labeling.
