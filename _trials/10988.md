abstract: "This study focuses on so called status-seeking behavior, characterized as behavior that maximizes the position in a non-monetary social hierarchy. Previous studies find that individuals have a fundamental intrinsic desire for social status and are willing to spend considerable resources (such as effort or money) in the competition for social status (Kosfeld, Neckermann, 2011; Gill et al., 2019; Hett et al. 2020). While status-seeking behavior is well-documented in a broad range of contexts where social status is assigned on the individual level, status-seeking behavior where social status is assigned to the group level has received far less attention.

The study design seeks to tackle two motivations why one could expect a change in prevalence and intensity of status-seeking behavior when social status is assigned to the group level and not on the individual level. First of all, group-structures and their inherently connected social identities might be inducing additional incentives for individuals to seek status in order to derive positive self-esteem from the group's status. This concern for group status might be of different quality than the concern for individual status, that might vary by the strength of identification with the in-group/out-group. Similarly, individual's status-seeking behavior in groups might be fostered by the group's inherent decision-making processes. For this, consider, e.g., situations where the concern for high social status is in conflict with the concern for a positive self-image. Status-seeking behavior in the form of unethical behavior is usually seen as immoral and, thus, might harm the individual's self-image. However, certain group decision-making processes have been found to induce a lack of feeling pivotal or responsible for the group decision (Falk et al., 2020). Thus, deciding within groups instead of as an isolated individual can provide excuses to behave immorally and such moral wiggle rooms might allow individuals within groups to break the mentioned trade-off between self-image and status concerns. In sum, this study seeks to investigate the effect of social identity and the trade-off between self-image and status concerns on status-seeking behavior.
