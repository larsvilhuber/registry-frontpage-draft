abstract: "Some 24 percent of children under the age of five in Ecuador are stunted, according to World Bank figures, and reversing this in the early years is critical to building human capital so all children can thrive and succeed. The Government of Ecuador is seeking to improve child development and nutrition during the first 1000 days of life, by revamping existing nationwide programs where program staff discuss prenatal care, early child development, healthy nutrition, breastfeeding, and hygiene. Due to COVID-19 these services are being provided virtually or in hybrid modalities. Previous evidence from Chimborazo, Ecuador shows that families can be unaware of their childâ€™s under nutrition and they lack information about behaviors that can improve their child's health and development. This evaluation will test whether sending text messages to caregivers increase their knowledge about early childhood development, nutrition, and healthy behaviors and leads to improved health and development outcomes for their children.
