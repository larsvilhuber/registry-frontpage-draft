abstract: "Do policies combining long-term environmentalism with short-term compensation for lower-income households influence concern about climate change and climate action? Building on previous literature that looks at support for climate change policies (Maestre-Andrés et al., 2019), this research posits that the inequality and fairness perceptions of environmental policies influence the prioritisation of climate change amongst voters, as well as the willingness to act for climate through political participation. In other words, ‘just transition’ policy programmes combining environmentalism with economic compensation should promote climate change politics, making climate change action more likely. The research tests this argument by designing two hypothetical climate policy packages. People who are presented with information on how environmental policy can protect the incomes and jobs of lower-income households should be more supportive of political action in favour of climate change policy compared to people presented with generic long-term climate policies. When environmental policy is combined with short-term compensation, the likelihood of conflict between economic hardship/growth and climate change policy costs is potentially reduced. This should lead to a more optimistic view of climate change action. In the absence of climate economic compensation policies, perceptions about climate change and climate change action are influenced by the need for economic prosperity and fewer government economic regulations (Benegal and Scruggs, 2016). The research design involves an information-provision treatment in Italy to test whether job and income compensation measures affect the climate change preferences of Italian voters. The treatment manipulation provides some people with information on environmental policies and redistributive measures, while the control group is presented with an environmental policy package without any reference to the distribution of its costs. The research looks at how different information changes the prioritisation of climate change policy, as well as attitudes towards climate change protests, environmentalist associations, and political participation. Furthermore, the experiment tests whether the treatment effect varies depending on the respondents’ perception of economic status and their previous information about climate change science. "
