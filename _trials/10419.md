abstract: "Covert payments from state officials to their super visors (supervisor kickbacks) are a frequently overlooked phenomenon, yet they can reveal fundamental features of collusion between officials and their supervisors. Supervisor kickbacks are particularly important in Sub-Saharan African societies, where a “moral economy” of corruption with re-distributive norms has been documented. We conduct a randomized unconditional cash transfer on traffic police agents in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to characterize the ways in which state officers' income is paid in kickbacks to their supervisors, and the role of income distribution on the kickbacks."
