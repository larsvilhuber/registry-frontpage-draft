abstract: "GiveDirectly aims to understand the role of unconditional cash transfers as one possible route to improving the self-reliance of refugees in protected displacement contexts. The program intends to provide around USD$1000 in unconditional cash transfers to all of the ~10,000 refugee households in Kiryandongo Refugee Settlement and about 5,000 host community households in Kiryandongo district, Uganda.

GiveDirectly recently conducted a pilot in Kyaka II Settlement in Uganda. Cash transfers were provided to 4,371 refugee and host community households. An internal evaluation of the pilot concluded that the transfer had positive indicative results and was operationally feasible. The project in Kiryandongo will build on the pilot by conducting a larger and more rigorous independent study. The impact evaluation of the transfer will be conducted by IDinsight and consists of a randomized control trial (RCT) with refugee households, a cross-sectional study with host recipients, and a longitudinal qualitative study with both refugee and host community households. The mixed methods approach will examine the impact of the cash transfers by carefully identifying what changed as well as why and how the change happened. Results of the program will inform future decision-making regarding cash transfers by donors and implementing organizations.

IDinsight will answer the following research questions in this evaluation: 
1) What is the impact of large, unconditional cash transfers on refugee households for outcomes such as income, assets, consumption, enterprise, food security and psychological well-being?
2) What do any changes caused by the cash transfers mean for the lives of refugee households and how did those changes come about?
3) What is the effect of cash transfers on host communities, and the relationship between host and refugee communities?
