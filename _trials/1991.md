abstract: "In this pre-analysis plan we describe the evaluation plans for “Mobile Phone Technology Based Nutrition Advisory Services” in Ghana (mNutrition). The mNutrition intervention is part of a global initiative supported by DFID to use mobile technology to improve the health and nutritional status of children and adults across the developing world. The objective of mNutrition in mAgri is to create and scale commercially sustainable mobile services enabling smallholder farmers to improve their nutrition, yields and incomes. The product to be delivered and evaluated is Ghana’s Vodafone Farmer Club. The service is a bundled solution offering agricultural and nutrition information in addition to voice and SMS services. The primary research questions are 1) What is the impact of the Farmer club product on agriculture income, agriculture production, and household and women’s dietary diversity (primary outcomes)?; 2) What is the impact of the Farmer club product on behaviors, knowledge, and practices (secondary outcomes); 3) What are the impacts of targeting women on primary and secondary outcomes?; 4) What is the demand for the Farmer Club product and can framing and targeting affect household’s willingness to pay?"
