abstract: "This study examines barriers to adjustments in intra-household resource allocation that are driven not by conflicting preferences but by miscoordination of actions due to an interplay of conventional roles and information asymmetry.

I study household production responses to a school-based agricultural extension program in Liberia. Conventionally, students (aged 12-20) work as assistants to their elders on farms. Students' agency is critical in catalyzing program impact but might be hindered if permission from their elders in changing farm resource allocation is required. Given descriptive evidence on costs in bargaining over resource allocation and social norms that discourage the reversal of conventional roles, I hypothesize that household responses to the program are hindered by two issues. First, elders have incomplete information about the potential effects of the program. Second, holding elders' preferences and expectations constant, students' actions are hindered by uncertainty about elders' expectations about their learning progress. I test the hypotheses in a two-year field experiment.

This experiment is embedded in a general randomized evaluation of the school-based agricultural education program (AEARCTR-0006671)."
