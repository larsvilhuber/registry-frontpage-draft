abstract: "Pastoralist households in northern and eastern Kenya face weather-related shocks due to drought and lack of forage which lead to low livestock productivity, loss of household wealth, higher food prices and increasing intercommunal conflicts. Women within these households often bear a disproportionate share of that risk, with their assets and even their own food consumption being the first things sacrificed as households cope with the devastation of drought. While there has been innovation of insurance contracts for this region (index-based livestock insurance, or IBLI), uptake remains low in part because the contracts have been built around what are culturally typed in the area as male activities, and in part because of the high upfront cost of a product that can only be purchased during a short sales window at the beginning of each rainy season. The purpose of this research is to learn how to make IBLI fully available to women so that they may benefit from it. We will focus on women who are currently members of a savings group, the ubiquitous social support structures that encourage members to save and invest while often also providing informal insurance against idiosyncratic shocks. Taking a sample of nearly 6,500 women belonging to 410 distinct savings groups located across 5 counties in northeastern Kenya, we will implement a randomized controlled trial to measure the effect on insurance uptake and subsequent asset protection of: i) reshaping the existing IBLI contract so that it speaks directly to the risks and needs that are most central to women, and ii) promoting the adoption of a ‘village insurance savings (VISA) account’ within each treated savings group as a way for women to save money in advance for insurance purchases."
