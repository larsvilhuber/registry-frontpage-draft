abstract: "The Laboratory Efficiency Assessment Framework (LEAF) is an environmental accreditation scheme designed to reduce the environmental impact of university research labs. It is key to achieve Imperial College London’s target of becoming a sustainable net-zero carbon institution by 2040. This paper analyses its effect on saved costs, including energy, and carbon emissions leveraging a randomized controlled trial (RCT), the gold standard methodology on the Maryland Scale  of impact evaluation. By randomizing the LEAF programme roll-out to a select number of laboratory buildings, we isolate its causal treatment effect from potential confounders. Further, we analyze whether a top down vis-a-vis a bottom-up implementation is more effective in increasing uptake. By providing rigorous evidence on the program’s average treatment effect of 3,000 pounds total cost and 8,5 tons of CO2 savings per lab space, this study seeks to inform potential replications in other higher education institutions in Great Britain and beyond."
