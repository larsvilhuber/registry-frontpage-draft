abstract: "This study investigates hiring practices in Ugandan sectors that employ higher educated youth, addressing the mismatch between educated youth and employer needs in a context where university educated youth face the highest unemployment rates. Through a randomized controlled trial with private firms, we examine the impact of better defining job requirements on two key aspects of the hiring process: creating applicant pools and candidate assessment. The research aims to (1) understand how firms hire higher educated workers, (2) determine how enhanced job postings affect applicant pool quality and hiring decisions, and (3) assess how making job requirements more salient after job posting impacts candidate evaluation and final hiring decisions. By examining the effects of job analysis at different stages of the hiring process - providing support either before posting jobs or after receiving applications - the study can identify whether improved matches come from attracting better candidates or from helping firms better evaluate existing applicant pools. This approach, focusing on the firm side of the labor market, complements existing research on job seekers and aims to identify constraints and potential interventions to enhance employer-employee match quality in sectors employing higher educated youth."
