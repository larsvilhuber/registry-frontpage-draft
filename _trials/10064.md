abstract: "This paper studies whether opposite opinions about an important, yet payoff-irrelevant topic deteriorate trust and offset the well-documented positive effect of communication. In an experimental setting, we exogenously vary the importance of the topic, and the subjectsâ€™ ability to communicate. We hypothesize that disagreeing on an important topic can counteract the trust-enhancing effect of communication. Furthermore, we argue that communication gets unfriendlier and trust becomes less likely if subjects have opposite opinions about a topic of higher importance. "
