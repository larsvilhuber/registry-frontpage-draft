abstract: "Lack of information about energy usage inhibits efficiency in energy conservation but can be overcome by providing simple, low-cost information. This study uses a randomized control trial to test the effect of knowledge information on the peak-avoidance behaviour of electricity consumption, with a design of various rounds of household-level message sending to test the mechanism for persistence in behaviour and habit formation process. We anticipate that our design and findings will help develop low-cost and long-lasting interventions for guiding households to choose peak-avoidance behaviour."
