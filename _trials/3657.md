abstract: "Standardized tests comparing educational achievements are an important policy tool.  U.S. students often rank poorly on such assessments. We propose that this is due not only to differences in ability but also to differences in effort on the test itself. We experimentally show that offering U.S. students incentives to put forth effort improves test performance substantially. In contrast, Shanghai students, who are top performers on assessments, are not affected by incentives. Our findings suggest that ranking countries based on low-stakes assessments does not reflect only differences in ability, but also intrinsic motivation to perform well on the test."
