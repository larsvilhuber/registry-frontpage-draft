abstract: "The international trade literature has shown a strong relationship between exporting and firms’ productivity and profitability. Despite that, the share of exporting firms in several developed and developing countries is relatively low. 

The goal of this project is twofold. First, we want to identify the main barriers preventing firms from exporting. Are they related to a misperception of firms’ managers about the true benefit of exporting? Alternatively, do the costs of exporting (red tape, credit constraints, difficulties to reach foreign consumers, etc.) outweigh its benefits? Second, we will evaluate whether low-cost informational interventions can induce firms to engage in exporting activities, and how this decision affects firms’ outcomes. 

To achieve these objectives, we will implement a firm-level Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) that involves manufacturing non-exporting firms in Brazil. The RCT will test how online courses about exporting-related procedures can affect firms’ decisions to export and their employment dynamics. The firms in the treatment group will be involved in distinct online training sessions providing information on export impediments: red tape, financial frictions and demand uncertainty. We will also provide consultancy services about how to export for a smaller group of firms. The ultimate goal is to evaluate policies that could promote international trade and economic development.
