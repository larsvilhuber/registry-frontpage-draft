abstract: "As the frequency and severity of extreme weather events increase, smallholder farmers face growing vulnerability. Crop diversification can act as insurance against climate variability, but the presence of correlation neglect in farmers' decision making could lead to suboptimal risk management. Our study examines the relationship between income diversification and correlation neglect among smallholder farmers.  Firstly, we assess the extent of correlation neglect and its effects on investments and land use decisions.  Next, we examine methods for reducing correlation neglect by comparing different ways of presenting historical information on the profitability of two crops.  We propose that integrating information, such as presenting the returns of both crops together, may facilitate the comparison of investment options and reduce cognitive limitations that contribute to correlation neglect. To test this hypothesis, we assess investment decisions based on different information-providing treatments in a framed field experiment with farmers in rural Brazil. Moreover, we investigate whether the treatments improve the accuracy of beliefs about the returns of the two crops. We contribute to the empirical literature on correlation neglect by applying the framework to the specific context of agricultural decision-making in a developing country and by investigating a potential mechanism to reduce this bias."
