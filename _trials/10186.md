abstract: "This project aims to investigate how people manage multiple debts. In particular, how they make repayment with limited cash flow. Previous studies indicate that some people prefer paying off smaller debts first when bigger debts have higher interest rates. It may lead to the loss of financial benefits when bigger debts are costly. This project not only attempts to identify such preference but also to investigate whether it is influenced by income, number of debts, and types of debts, and whether the costs of paying off lower higher interest debts are exacerbated if distinct debt products such as BNPL schemes are introduced vs. only credit card debts."
