abstract: "We will use an audit study and standardized patients to measure quality of care in China. Specifically, 32 research assistants will be trained to present themselves as patients of common conditions (e.g., chest pain) using standardized scripts. They will then visit multiple hospitals in China. They will record the treating healthcare providers' diagnostic and prescription behaviors during the visits. These behaviors will then be compared to clinical guidelines or pre-specified expert consensus to assess quality of care. The scenarios will be selected based on a pilot test in a way that minimize disruption to healthcare operations and incur no harm on the auditors."
