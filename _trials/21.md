abstract: "Despite ongoing efforts from both the Government of Uganda and the international donor community, many children in Uganda still are not acquiring literacy skills at a satisfactory level. This project evaluates an innovative new educational paradigm, the Northern Uganda Literacy Project (NULP), which currently focuses on P1 to P3 (first- to third-grade) students, employing a mother-tongue-first instructional approach and extensive teacher support and training. Using a randomized controlled trial this study measures the effects of the NULP on learning outcomes. We study 128 schools, which were randomly assigned to either the full NULP, a half-program that includes the materials from the NULP but where the training is provided through government-employed coordinating centre tutors (CCTs), or a control group. Outcomes are to be measured principally in terms of improvements in Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) and Early Grade Writing Assessment (EGWA) scores. The results of this study will be used to further improve the NULP, helping to maximize both its academic benefits and cost-effectiveness; we also conduct classroom observations (using rubrics and/or videos), surveys of teachers and surveys of parents in order to capture additional outcomes.

The trial was revised to account for a substantial expansion in its length and scope. The original study followed 38 schools for one year, 2013, focusing solely on P1. In the expanded study, we follow 128 schools (including the first 38) for up to five years, 2013 to 2017, following students from P1 all the way up to P3. We have an additional sample of 30 pure control schools originally sampled that we plan on collecting outcomes near the end of the study.

This study will also include a longitudinal subsample of students from the evaluation, followed from grade one in 2014, to ~age 18 in 2024, and ~age 21 in 2027. The study will examine the long-term effects of improved literacy on subsequent educational, holistic skills, and life outcomes. We will further study how these impacts vary across students, providing critical evidence on how early reading impacts transition to adulthood."
