abstract: "The Becoming One program is a skills-based curriculum designed for faith leaders to use with couples in their congregation seeking counseling prior to or following a wedding. The curriculum uses a biblical framework to communicate about practical skills for improving communication, emotional regulation, shared control over financial resources, financial planning, and sexual consent and pleasure. Faith leaders lead the participatory sessions with groups of couples, asking both members of the couples to attend together. The 12 total sessions are intended to be delivered once a week with each session lasting approximately 90 min. At the heart of the Becoming One intervention is the idea that individuals and couples will change their behavior when they are already self-motivated to do so, and when the source of advice or counsel is a person of social, religious, or political significance for them.

This study measures the effect of the Becoming One (B1) program through a block-randomized control trial. There are three waves of measurement: a pre-randomization baseline, a midline survey approximately five weeks after the "intervention" group has completed the couples counseling program, and an endline survey approximately one year after the "intervention" group has completed the program, but before the "comparison" group has gone through couples' counseling.

The random assignment works by forming couples into pairs within congregations (groups organized by the faith leaders) by matching on their baseline levels of physical violence, and then randomizing one couple in each pair to the intervention group, and one couple to the comparison group. The baseline levels of physical violence include an average of six binary indicators (standardized to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1) for whether the woman in the couple reports having been pushed, slapped, arm-twisted / hair-pulled, punched, kicked, or choked over the preceding 12 months. 

The main analyses of the experiment take place at the couple-level. We will construct non-parametric p-values calculated using randomization inference. Using simulation, we will report the alphas (type 1 error risks) one would need to apply at the test-level in order to reject at least one test in the family of main analyses only 5% and 10% of the time, under the global null of no effect on any outcome for any unit.

Our main estimator is a covariate-adjusted estimator below, which, in addition to conditioning on an indicator for the treatment assignment and block-level fixed effects, adjusts for  predictive covariates using a mean-centering and interaction approach described in Lin (2013). For each outcome, we use a cross-validated Lasso estimator to select only those covariates that are predictive of the outcome, irrespective of whether those covariates are imbalanced. We justify this approach through a simulation study.

We expect to encounter two-sided non-compliance in this study. For our main analyses, our estimand is an intent-to-treat (ITT) effect.

To reduce the number of tests we are running, our main analyses focus on four outcomes that combine many theoretically-related measures:

  1. Intimate Partner Violence: a binary indicator that is 1 if the female partner has experienced any of ten types of physical or sexual violence over the five months preceding the midline survey, and 0 otherwise. We expect that the ITT effect is negative and so will conduct a one-sided test of the null hypothesis of zero or positive effects.
  
  2. Control and Decision-Making: an index of several groups of items, each of which is coded to vary between 0 and 1. The groups include decision-making about household finances and purchasing decisions, financial control, and social control. When at 0, this implies the female experiences all forms of financial and social control, and both partners perceive her to be excluded from all decision-making. When it is at 1, this implies the female partner does not report experiencing any forms of financial or social control, and is involved in all aspects of decision-making. We expect that the ITT effect is positive, and will conduct an upper-tailed test of the null hypothesis of zero or negative effects.

  3. Sexual Consent and Autonomy: an index of items, mostly answered by the female partner but one answered by the male partner, about whether the male takes a non-coercive strategy when his partner refuses sex, and how the female partner feels about her control over decisions about and initiation of sex. The responses are coded to vary between 0 and 1. When the index is at 0, this implies that the female partner reports sexual coercion across all of the domains, and that the male partner reports coercive behavior. When it is at 1, this implies the absence of coercion.
  
  4. Communication and conflict management techniques. An index of items addressing a broad range of domains of communication, answered by both female and male partners. The domains include communication about sex, about daily events and companionship, and techniques for de-escalation when arguing about difficult topics. When the index is at 0, this implies that the partners agree that they have had no supportive or open communication or techniques for peaceful or de-escalating communication across many domains. When it is at 1, this implies the partners agree that they communicate with supportive or open communication or techniques for peaceful or de-escalating communication across all the domains.

We will base our main confirmatory inferences on these four outcomes, which also constitute the family of tests for which we will construct multiple comparison-adjusted alphas as above. 

In order to explain why these outcomes move, we will report and describe treatment effects graphically by plotting point estimates on the underlying items. We also have a range of secondary analyses that target either variables that we expect mediate the effect of B1 on these four outcomes, or other outcomes that are not of primary interest. All of these will be reported as analyzed, possibly in an appendix. We will note departures from the analysis plan, and label tests as pre-registered or not.
