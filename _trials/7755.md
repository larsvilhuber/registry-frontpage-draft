abstract: "In response to the broad and devastating economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on households, the national government of Colombia developed and implemented a new cash transfer program, Ingreso Solidario, to provide consumption support to vulnerable households that were not beneficiaries of any program in the Colombian safety net. To lower transaction costs and avoid personal contact that could contribute to the spread of the coronavirus, the government is turning to mobile money or electronic transfers to bank accounts or digital wallets as safe, secure, and efficient modes of payment. In addition to these logistical benefits and lower transaction costs, the large-scale usage of digital modes of delivering cash transfers may lead to benefits for households. Many households without prior access to a formal financial institution will be introduced to formal digital payments and interact with a formal financial institution for the first time.

This study uses a randomized control trial to study the impact of outreach from a financial institution as part of a public-private partnership on take up of simplified digital accounts and digital receipts of cash transfers. Additionally, we will study the impact of financial inclusion on householdsâ€™ financial outcomes, formal employment, time use and usage of health services using a combination of administrative records and survey data.
