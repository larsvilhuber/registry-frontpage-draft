abstract: "Students’ second-order beliefs about their parents and peers could affect their major educational decisions, particularly when they are uncertain about the potential returns of each option. We are conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with around 1000 Grade 10 students at one Chinese senior high school. By the end of Grade 10, these students will choose between pursuing a science or arts track for the remaining two years of senior high school – a decision that crucially influences their eligibility for specific college majors and future career paths. This RCT investigates how students’ second-order beliefs regarding their parents’ and peers’ biased views about gender and science aptitude influence this decision and their academic performance. The study begins with baseline surveys of students and their parents to assess the formation of students' perceived beliefs and to identify any misconceptions between students, their peers, and their parents. Following this, the study implements an intervention wherein accurate information about peer and parental beliefs, as well as potential returns of each option, is provided to students in the treatment group. The RCT will evaluate whether this intervention influences students' academic performance and their subsequent academic decisions.
