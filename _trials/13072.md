abstract: "Previous research shows that men tend to outperform women during negotiations. Societal expectations about how women and men should behave during negotiations may help explain this outcome. Research has also found that individual behavior is influenced by the embodiment of a gender different from ones own identity. Specifically, women embodying a male avatar were found to be more sensitive to immediate rewards, which may translate into more aggressive negotiation behavior than when embodying a female avatar. To determine the influence of gender avatar embodiment in negotiations, we create an online laboratory experiment where individuals choose their gender avatar to be displayed to a negotiation partner. We test whether those individuals who choose an avatar that is different from their true identity have different negotiation behavior and outcomes than those that choose their true gender avatar. "
