abstract: "We conduct two large-scale, randomized controlled field experiments for movie tickets sold on smartphones. Subjects are randomly assigned to one of several promotion campaigns with price discounts and/or charitable donations. Discount-only and charity-only campaigns increase demand. However, campaigns with both discounts and donations can decrease ticket demand. The findings are consistent with a self-signaling theory, whereby the discount crowds out the consumer’s self-inference from the charitable donation. Subjects also self-report lower ratings of “feeling good about themselves” for campaigns with both large discounts and donations. A structural model of self-signaling is fit to the data to quantify the role of self-signaling on purchases."
