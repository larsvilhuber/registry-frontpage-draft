abstract: "Times of economic crises raise questions about how to distribute burdens and support, evoking a debate about what is fair. While previous research has shown that, even in economically stable times, there exists a plurality of fairness views, it is less clear how and whether the latter react to a changing economic environment. In this project, we use a series of experiments to explore whether negative income shocks affect individual preferences for redistribution. The experiment consists of two parts: a production and a redistribution stage. After having earned an endowment, participants are paired in groups of two and given the opportunity to redistribute income. We then explore the effect of negative income shocks, varying both who is affected and what is known about the experiences of others. Finally, in a separate treatment, we introduce information about experiences of real world economic shocks into our set-up and investigate the impact of these on behaviour in the laboratory."
