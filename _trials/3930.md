abstract: "Community-driven development interventions blend multiple components difficult to identify separately. The literature reports mixed impacts of these interventions. We designed and conducted a field experiment in 126 schools of the Angolan province of Kwanza Sul, aiming to distinguish the impact of the information and the collective action components of a scorecard system. Specifically, we explore a design with three treatments: (i) decentralized information to parents on the performance of schools, (ii) organization of meetings with parents without pre-set information on performance, and (iii) centralized information on performance through meetings with parents. Our measurement of outcomes includes: parent, school, teacher, and school principal surveys, as well as lab games and test scores. In the games, apart from standard lab games (trust, public-good), we develop a novel dictator game where teachers individually decide about sharing their endowments with multiple parents."
