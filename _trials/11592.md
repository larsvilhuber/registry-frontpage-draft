abstract: "How well informed are job seekers about the wages and other amenities offered by different jobs? When deciding which jobs to apply for, how do they weigh wages against other characteristics of the applied-for jobs?  Does poor information distort job seekers’ search and application behavior? To answer these questions, we conduct a survey with an embedded randomized treatment among recent graduates from education programs in Denmark. We tailor the survey to each education program, so that respondents are asked about three specific types of jobs that are relevant, given their educational background. 

The first part of the survey elicits beliefs about average i) entry-level wages at the job type level, ii) success rates of applications, iii) wages five years after starting a career in a given job type.  By comparing elicited beliefs to ground truth measures from administrative registers, we determine the extent of workers’ misperceptions about potential jobs. 

Second, we expose respondents to a randomized information provision experiment in which we inform them about the true average entry-level wages in each of the three relevant education-specific jobs. 

Third, we elicit each respondent’s beliefs about several specific job characteristics she would expect for herself if she was to start her job in each of the three relevant job types. The dimensions we cover are i), ii) and iii) above, as well as expected hours worked in the first and in the fifth year after starting a job, and expected likelihoods of getting along well with colleagues and of performing well on the job. 

Fourth, we use stylized scenarios in order to assess respondents’ intentions for job search. Specifically, we ask about the probability of accepting a job offer in each of the three job types conditional on receiving one, and about the likelihood of sending one’s next application to each of the three job types. 

Finally, we plan to link the survey data to registry data on background characteristics on e.g. sex and parental background (for example, parent’s field of study and job type), actual job search behavior, on final job matches.
