abstract: "Salience theory and Regret Theory predicts that choices between two lotteries are driven not only by the marginal distributions of the lotteries, but also by the correlation between the two lotteries. In particular, both theories predict a preference for relative skewness. Our previous work has documented a precisely estimated null effect of relative skewness on non-repeated lottery choices. Based on suggestive evidence from this past experiment, we hypothesize that experienced outcomes feedback will induce participants to express preferences over relative skewness. We test this conjecture in an exploratory experiment.
