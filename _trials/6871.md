abstract: "In this project, we are partnering with state and county courts from around the country to help improve decision-making and reduce racial disparities at the pretrial justice stage. We plan to tackle racial disparities driven by bias and inaccurate stereotypes through a combination of three interventions that are low cost and have shown tremendous efficacy in other settings. The first intervention provides objective information on the pretrial risk of white and non-white defendants to judges to correct inaccurate stereotypes that exaggerate the relative danger of non-white defendants. The second intervention provides a simple benchcard to judges to slow down and systematize their decision-making. The third intervention provides detailed feedback to judges on their own outcomes over time, giving them the motivation, information, and tools necessary to reduce racial disparities in their pretrial decisions. We will estimate both (i) the impact of the full set of interventions on long-run outcomes and (ii) the impact of each individual intervention on medium-run outcomes. Our key outcomes of interest are overall pretrial detention rates as well as the racial gap in detention rates for white and non-white defendants. "
