abstract: "What factors lead CEOs to take political stances as part of a business strategy? Prior research has found that CEO political stances have strategic implications for stakeholders (such as workers and consumers), while politically motivated social agitation from outside groups can impact board departures. In this study, I plan on running a lab-in-the-field experiment examining the role of personal profits, cause-CEO value alignment, and sustained stakeholder pushback on participantsâ€™ willingness to take a costly political stand as part of a business strategy. This project aims to contribute causal antecedents to literature on the strategic implications of CEO sociopolitical stances."
