abstract: "We study the preferences of adults for their hypothetical child’s educational and career paths. For that purpose, we implement a discrete choice experiment among a representative survey of 6000 adults aged between 25 and 60 in Switzerland where we ask them in multiple choice situations which of two “careers” they would prefer for their child. These careers are defined by the highest educational attainment, wage, the hierarchical position in their job, and the risk that their job will be substituted within the next 10 years. We ask half of the survey sample about their preferences for their hypothetical daughter, and the other half about preferences for their hypothetical son. We investigate how career attributes affect the likelihood of a career being chosen, how these preferences for career attributes vary depending on whether respondents are asked about their hypothetical daughter or son, and whether preferences depend on respondent characteristics.
