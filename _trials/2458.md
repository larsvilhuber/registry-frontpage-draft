abstract: "The present paper offers a concise plan for analyzing several related field experiment to be conducted during the 2017 federal election campaign in Germany. Given time constraints, I merely focus on the analysis I plan to conduct once the outcome data is available. Theoretical considerations will only be touched upon briefly. In case of any inconsistencies or shortcomings, I will rely on the standard operating procedures presented in Green and Lin (2016)."
