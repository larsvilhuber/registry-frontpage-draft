abstract: "For the hundreds of millions of pastoralists, loss of livestock due to shocks is a primary concern because livestock can represent a large portion of household wealth and productive capital. In sub-Saharan Africa, drought is a main cause of livestock losses and has been shown to drive pastoral households into poverty, and in some cases, trap them there. Insurance is a promising financial tool that is used in many agricultural settings to mitigate the impacts of drought but had not been available to most pastoralists because these had yet to be a cost-effective model for offering it. The Index Based Livestock Insurance (IBLI) product was piloted in northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia starting in 2010 and 2012, respectively. Since then, the product has grown in scale, offering access to formal insurance coverage to millions of pastoralists. Consistent with the literature on insurance coverage, studies of the pilots have shown that IBLI coverage benefits clients in several ways, but there have been no studies on the long-term impacts of access to IBLI. In this study, we aim to determine the impacts that IBLI has had on its clients over the 10 + years that is has been available in the Horn of Africa. Specifically, we will test if the impacts identified during project activities in the study region between 2010 and 2015 have persisted. Our empirical approach to causal identification relies on variation in IBLI purchases caused by an intervention that was both randomized at the household level and increased IBLI uptake during the pilot period.
