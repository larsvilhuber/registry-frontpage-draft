abstract: "This study plans to examine whether people express different risk and time preferences when: a) offered payment in cash or by mobile money, and b) when options are offered in either whole/round numbers or exact numbers. We expect our findings will be of methodological interest to experimental economists, but we also expect that our findings can speak to the broader question of behavioral biases that govern human behavior. This is important because studies in the literature often differ in these choices; it is unclear whether measured risk and time preferences differ across studies due to differences in context, innate preferences, or due to these often overlooked experimental design choices. If we find differences in elicited measured preferences due to form of payment or denomination, we can also explore the behavioral biases that govern how people think about money. "
