abstract: "Education systems around the world face a “learning crisis” of low average learning and high learning inequality. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these problems, and threatens lasting consequences for a generation of students. In this project, we conduct a randomized control trial in around 500 public primary schools in the Islamabad Capital Territory in Pakistan to explore how low cost technology can empower home-based and school-based actors to boost student learning in foundational math. We use phone-based technology (a novel smartphone app, messaging, and automated call services) to alleviate constraints relating to information about children's learning and potential learning activities, guidance about how to connect learning activities to a given learning level, and teacher monitoring structures that may inhibit learning. We explore whether alleviating these constraints can empower actors at school and at home to provide children with more personalized learning and overall improved learning outcomes.
