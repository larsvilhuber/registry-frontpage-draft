abstract: "We run an experimental study on the online labour market Prolific. Allowing for one-sided earnings choices after joint production in pairs, we investigate drivers of giving behaviour by varying the level of hierarchy and connectedness stakeholders experience in the experiment. To measure the effect of hierarchy for giving, we compare choices under boss-assisstant to co-worker vignettes. We also compare co-worker vs. neutral vignettes to measure the effect of connectedness on giving.
