abstract: "From existing literature, we assume that when participants choose to follow the distribution rules in a bargaining problem, the rules represent their norms and entitlements. At the beginning of the experiment, participants will be asked to select their preferred distribution among three rules: equal division (the two bargainers share the total pie equally), equal surplus (the bargainers share equally the surplus, the difference between the total pie and their disagreement payoffs) and proportional distribution (the bargainers get a part of the pie proportional to their disagreement payoffs). The disagreement payoffs are determined by their performance in a real-effort task. We then have 3 scenarios: (1) when the bargainers choose the same distribution rule and both agree to follow it, subjects will automatically earn according to the rule, (2) when the bargainers choose the same distribution rule but did not agree to follow it, a bargaining stage will proceed, and (3) when the bargainers choose different distribution rules, a bargaining stage will also proceed. Scenario (2) is our next focus, as we will examine when this rule switching occurs. Lastly, during bargaining, we will also analyze proposals and agreement rates. We will investigate these research topics in a Nash demand game and an unstructured bargaining game.
