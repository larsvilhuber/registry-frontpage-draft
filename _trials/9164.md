abstract: "This study examines the willingness to take COVID-19 treatments, in a context where treatments are new and in short supply. When treatments are in short supply, people will often have difficulties accessing treatments, and even more difficulties accessing their preferred treatment. We examine how people's willingness to take a COVID-19 treatment is affected by there being multiple treatments on the market, but only one of the treatments (which may or may not be the most effective treatment) is available for a person to take. Further, COVID-19 treatments (as opposed to the vaccines) need to be prescribed by providers. Providers will, however, often lack experience with the treatments, due to their novelty, and therefore may be more reluctant to prescribe them. Given family physicians are generally a highly trusted source of health information, we are particularly interested in knowing the impact on people's willingness to take a COVID-19 treatment from the treatment being prescribed by their family physician, versus another physician."
