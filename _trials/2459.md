abstract: "There is mounting evidence indicating that schoolchildren in many developing countries lag far behind their expected grade-level performance. Remedial education can help these low-performing students, but it does not address the needs of their high-performing peers. Ability-based grouping can benefit both types of students, but it may be too coarse to address students' individual learning needs. We will conduct an experiment in 14 public "model" schools in Rajasthan, India to evaluate the impact of personalized instruction for 3,331 students in grades 6 to 8, as delivered by a computer-assisted learning software. We will compare a version of the software that provides students with only grade-appropriate activities (the typical approach used by most software products) with a fully and a partially customized version of the program, as well as with a remedial  version of the program. We plan to use these comparisons to understand what type of personalization is most (cost-)effective in improving student learning."
