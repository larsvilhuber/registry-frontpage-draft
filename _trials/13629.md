abstract: "This study builds on our results from the project "Debunking “fake news” on social media: short-term, long-term, and spillover effects of fact check and media literacy interventions", which was pre-registered under the RCT ID AEARCTR-0008199. In our original study we analyzed the effectiveness of fact-checking and media literacy interventions in the context of Covid-19- and other health-related posts on social media. With this follow-up study we aim to better understand the external validity of our findings by taking the interventions to a new context (replacing the fake news and facts about Covid-19 with fake news and facts about environmental topics). Additionally, we want to understand if and how the degree of the credibility of a certain fake is related to the effectiveness of an intervention."
