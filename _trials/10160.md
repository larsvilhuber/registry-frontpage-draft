abstract: "Focusing on the 2022 Brazilian presidential election, I study how an election result can affect people's views, attitudes, and preferences. I collect more than 5,000 respondents during a 6-weeks window that goes from before the elections' first-round to after the elections' second-round. The 2022 Brazilian elections are being very polarizing and uncertain. By exploiting respondents' expectations of the election results and recontacting them right after the final result, I will manage to identify how the election's results affect people views, attitudes, and preferences. More precisely, the main outcomes are going to be respondents' perceptions of what people think, their affective polarization, and their trust towards the government are affected, and then how these effects might translate in a shift in policy preferences, distinguishing between economic and moral policies. I also elicit respondents' exposure and belief of fake news to then explore how this might affect polarization levels. In an additional wave conducted one year after the election, I conduct an experiment to identify the effect of providing good or bad news about the economy on the expectations about the country and attitudes towards violence and democracy.
