abstract: "This trial evaluates the effects of three different and policy relevant child care conditions on children’s outcomes: (i) attending with improved quality, (ii) attending with regular quality, and (iii) not attending.

The improved quality condition is based on an improvement package that was applied to some of the early childhood centers in Panama, and includes teacher training sessions and monitoring and supervision from the central level. It also includes additional resources and important improvements in infrastructure for some of the centers. The improvement package was randomly assigned across centers.

To have the possibility of evaluating the three treatment conditions, we chose preschool centers that were located at a walkable distance from each other, in which one had been assigned to the improvement package and the other was part of a control group. Then, we recruited families in the same geographical area, that had a child of the proper age, and that were interested in applying to a preschool center. A total of 1900 children were surveyed. All of the families were included on the application lists for the centers, and then a lottery in each center defined the assignment of the slots.

The experiment will allow us to identify the impact of the three different treatment conditions on the children, including pairwise comparisons of the counterfactual scenarios. Our main variables of interest are related to (i) child development, (ii) labor force participation of the members of the family, and (iii) quality of time at home.
