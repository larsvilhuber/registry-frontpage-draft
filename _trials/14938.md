abstract: "The study aims to assess the impact of a mathematics teacher training program specifically designed for primary school teachers. The program will target grade 3 mathematics teachers in Piemonte and Campania, regions representing northern and southern Italy, respectively. Developed by researchers at the Department of Mathematics, University of Turin, the training is focused on enhancing teachers’ ability to foster numeracy skills in all children. It emphasizes active learning methods to boost student engagement, deepen their understanding, and support the construction of mathematical meaning. The program’s theory of change suggests that these activities will encourage active participation, alleviate anxiety, enhance critical thinking, and ultimately promote a deep understanding of mathematical concepts. The training will be conducted in small groups of approximately 10 teachers, with nine sessions (four in-person and five online). The evaluation will employ a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, with randomization at the school-building level. All teachers enrolled in the trial within a participating school building will be randomly assigned to either the treatment group, receiving the training, or the control group."
