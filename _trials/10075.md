abstract: "It is often suggested that religion shapes social preferences. It may contribute to both pro-social behavior among church members, but also to a greater animosity and conflicts across religious boundaries. In this project, we will study what type of social preferences religious leaders try to instill among church members. Specifically, whether they aim to instill not only in-group altruism but also hostility to members of other churches or non-religious people. We will experimentally elicit measures of pro-social and anti-social preferences towards members of various churches among a sample of religious leaders and congregants of their churches."
