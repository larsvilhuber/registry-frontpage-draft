abstract: "We have run a randomised controlled trial to test variations on microfinance contracts.  This experiment was run in Jhelum, Khushab, Mandi Bahaudin and Rawalpindi from September 2015; we finished the endline questionnaire in September 2016. At the time of writing this plan, we have access to the administrative data on contract offers and take-up, which we have checked for general patterns and missing values; we have not yet run any substantive analysis on it. We are in the process of cleaning endline questionnaire data, and we anticipate beginning substantive analysis on this data in February 2017."
