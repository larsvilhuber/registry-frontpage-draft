abstract: "In order for utilities to provide high quality water and sanitation services to growing urban populations, they must have a sufficient and stable revenue stream. Utilities must price services to cover the cost of delivering services to existing customers and to invest in expanding the network to reach those who currently lack access to them. Even as utilities make progress in pricing services better, customer arrears – i.e., customers who do not pay their bills on time or in full – can undermine utilities’ financial sustainability. Currently, utilities in Kenya have substantial portions of customers with arrears on their accounts. In cooperation with a large utility in Kenya this project will implement a randomized control trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of electronic (mobile SMS) messages in improving customer bill payment.
