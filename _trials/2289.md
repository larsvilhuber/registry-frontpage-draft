abstract: "Since the launch of the World Wide Web project in the 90s, the development of internet has being constantly accelerating, modifying the way in which social relations are established and maintained, as well as the resources used by the population to develop day-to-day activities, like shopping or reading the news. This situation has led to the outbreak of a new phenomenon: the digital gap. A problem which refers to the inability of certain people to take advantage of this new tool, and that specially affects the elderly. This study looks at a program led by a local network of libraries in the province of Barcelona which offers  short courses of digital training to individuals aged 55 and over, to look at the impact of the digital training on the digital knowledge and the social network of participants.
