abstract: "Public education generates benefits that accrue both to the individual and to the community as a whole. By preparing students to compete for jobs and social positions, education acts as a private good with benefits that are enjoyed individually. By producing citizens and workers who strengthen our democracy and economy, education also acts a public good with benefits enjoyed by everyone in a society. This study asks how the framing of these benefits—education as a private good, a public good, or a combination of both—affect individuals' preferences for various school characteristics. If people think of education primarily as a private good, will they be willing to travel further for a school with higher academic performance? If people think of education primarily as a public good, will they place greater weight on racial/ethnic and economic diversity? How does thinking of education as a mixed public and private good affect school choices? We explore these questions by conducting a survey experiment using the Harvard Digital Lab for the Social Sciences (DLABSS). In the survey, participants are randomly assigned statements that depict education as a public, private, or mixed good. They then select their preferred schools from a series of head-to-head conjoint experiments in which the schools’ characteristics vary randomly. This research design allows us to identify the effects of these priming statements on participants’ school selections and the school characteristics that they prefer."
