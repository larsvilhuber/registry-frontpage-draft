abstract: "Modern welfare economics defers to revealed preference when assessing an individual's welfare, i.e., option A is deemed better than option B if, given the choice, the individual would choose A over B. However, in some cases, such choice data is difficult or even impossible to obtain. Consider, for example, the welfare of a taxpayer whose tax dollars may either go to what he considers a good or bad cause. Supposing there is no way for the taxpayer to learn where the tax dollars went, does the way the government spends them matter for the individual's welfare? Note that we cannot ask the taxpayer in an incentive-compatible way which cause he prefers while keeping him ignorant of which cause is ultimately chosen. 

In this experiment, we use a choosing-for-others framework to study the welfare consequences of satisfying someone's (call him Alex) preferences in a similar paradigm as in the example above. We study whether participants decrease Alex's surprise bonus for his preference to be satisfied (i.e., a willingness-to-pay measure using Alex's bonus). We do so for two cases: when Alex will learn whether his preference is satisfied and when Alex will not learn whether his preference is satisfied. We also vary Alex's expectation, whether he believes it is likely (or not) his preference is satisfied, and we tell the participants about this expectation. Assuming that participants choose for others as they would choose for themselves, this allows us to shed light on the welfare consequences of choice problems where preference satisfaction and beliefs do not move in tandem (i.e., where preferences can be satisfied while beliefs remain fixed)."
