abstract: "Access to timely market information can improve bargaining power in transactions. However, subscription services, requiring users to pay for accessing market information, reach only a small fraction of the potential market. Employing a randomised clustered control trial across 187 villages in Guinea-Bissau, we evaluate various models for disseminating market information. In about two-thirds of the villages, a focal point appointed by the village receives weekly market updates via phone-calls from a team of market analysts based in the capital. These focal points are encouraged to share this information with other producers in their respective villages. Additionally, we randomly allocate half of the focal points with a list of buyers' contacts to examine whether search barriers impede transactions in this market. In the remaining third of the villages, producers are offered direct access to weekly market updates via robocalls and an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system through a subscription service. Our study contributes to understanding the role of human intermediaries in facilitating market information access and provides insights for designing effective interventions to enhance market access for small-scale producers."
