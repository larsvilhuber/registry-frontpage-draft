abstract: "The ideas of a 4-day week and tax-free overtime are currently being widely discussed in Germany. We investigate the support for these measures depending on the level at which they are implemented, individually, company-wide or nationwide. A reduction (extension) in working hours means a lower relative income for the individual if working hours are reduced (extended) at an individual level, but not if working hours are reduced collectively. If social comparisons take place more via income/consumption than via leisure time, the approval of a reduction (extension) in working hours could be greater (smaller) if it takes place at a collective level than if it takes place at an individual level.

We conduct a survey experiment employing a between-subjects design with a representative sample of full- and part-time employees in Germany. Participants are randomly assigned to one of six treatment groups. Three groups were asked about support for a reduction in working hours and three groups about support for an increase in overtime hours. In the respective thematic groups, the questions differ in terms of the level at which the policy measure is to be introduced, individually, company-wide or nationwide. Next, we ask all participants to indicate to what extent they support the implementation on a five-point Likert scale.

Our experimental design allows us to identify the causal effects of the level of implementation on support for reducing or increasing working hours and to analyse heterogenous effects between socio-demographic groups and by attitudes.  "
