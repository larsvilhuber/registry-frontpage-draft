abstract: "We study the relationship between policy evidence and political accountability in Liberia. Specifically, we study 1) candidates for the Liberian House of Representatives in the October 2017 election and 2) households whose children were a part of the authors' previous evaluation of the Partnership Schools for Liberia (PSL) program. The study varies the provision of RCT results to candidates for the Liberian House of Representatives and bureaucrats, and varies the provision of information about candidates' public positions on PSL to households.  The primary outcomes of interest for candidates are stated public positions on PSL, codified in two ways: mentions of PSL in representative debates for a subset of the sample whose debates happened after the PSL report became public, and responses to our survey question asking which statement they would like us to publicly tell their voters they support). The primary outcomes of interest for households are self-reported voting intentions and candidate approval rates. We plan to examine heterogeneity in treatment effects along several dimensions, but the most important among candidates is the density of PSL schools in their district; among households, it is PSL treatment assignment status.
