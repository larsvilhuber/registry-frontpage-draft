abstract: "The state-sponsored Brazilian “Programa Fomento Rural”, created in 2011, aims to support poor smallholder farming households. Under the working hypothesis that farmers often cannot increase production due to lack of productive knowledge or resource constraints, this program couples rural extension services with non-reimbursable cash grants, which must be invested into agreed upon projects. The program strives to improve household welfare, including food security, by improving farmers’ production capacities. As of May 2018, nearly 200,000 families had enrolled. According to qualitative assessments, the program has been successful at increasing total farm investments and agricultural production as well as diversifying agricultural produce. 

The goal of this project is to evaluate the Fomento program using a multi-site randomized controlled trial to quantitatively assess Fomento's impact on production and wellbeing, and to uncover the channels through which it alleviates rural poverty.  The study takes place in three states of Brazil with different socioeconomic characteristics – Rio Grande do Sul, Minas Gerais, and Para. Ultimately, this study will test the effectiveness of a graduation-style program that couples productive asset grants to extension services on farm production and household wellbeing.
