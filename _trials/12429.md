abstract: "Different household members often have access to independent information through their personal experiences and social networks.  Recent field evidence shows that husbands and wives donâ€™t always learn from each other (Conlon et al., 2022; Fehr et al., 2022). Using a lab-in-the-field experiment in India, this project studies information diffusion between married couples when the information set is gendered and non-gendered. To study the consequences of (im)perfect information flow within married couples on household decision-making when deciding who to allocate decision-making power to, based on information aggregation. Gendered societies lead to gendered roles and decision-making power within households, leading to different comparative advantages. Thus this project also studies information diffusion when the information set is gendered i.e,  how individuals treat their own and their spouse's information in gendered domains, i.e., does one over-correct or under-correct depending on whether they have a comparative advantage in a domain.
