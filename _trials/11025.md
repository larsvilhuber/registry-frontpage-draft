abstract: "The youth and rural women entrepreneurship project is funded by the McGill University MasterCard Foundation Transitions Fund Project. This project is a partnership between McGill University, the Association of Ghana Industries (AGI), the University of Ghana Nutrition Research and Training Center (NRTC) and the University of Ghana Business School (UGBS) and seeks to promote the collaborative creation of agricultural enterprises between graduates and rural women entrepreneurs. The project leverages the business contest organized by AGI to create an entrepreneurship hub at the NRTC, which will serve as a location for capacity building, creativity, innovation, and business incubation for the jointly created start-ups of graduates and rural women entrepreneurs."
