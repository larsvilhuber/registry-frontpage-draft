abstract: "The promotion of insect farming as an agribusiness aims to enhance protein availability for animal feed and biofertilizers in crop production. While small-scale lab experiments indicate the significant economic potential of insect larvae for animal feed and frass fertilizer for crop production, there is a lack of empirical evidence on the impact of scaling these innovations at the farmers' level. This document outlines the pre-analysis plan for a clustered randomized controlled trial (RCT) that investigates the effects of scaling insect-based products within the context of village poultry and home gardens in Kenya. The study will involve 800 small-scale farmers (and 68 clusters) in Embu County who engage in poultry and vegetable production. These farmers will receive training on insect-based products, larvae for poultry feed, and insect-frass biofertilizer for vegetable farming. The primary scaling strategies involve educating farmers on the utilization of insect-based products in poultry and vegetable farming through formal training and partial subsidy for the insect-based products. While the training addresses technical know-how and information barriers, the subsidy aims to reduce risks and encourage subsequent adoption. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) design will be implemented to assess the impact of these interventions. All farmers will undergo training and then half of them will be randomly assigned to the subsidy treatment. A subset of farmers who will receive the subsidy treatment will also receive a nudging treatment using phone calls and SMS texts to address behavioural factors such as procrastination. The RCT design ensures a systematic and unbiased evaluation of the outcomes associated with each treatment, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of the implemented strategies. This protocol document elucidates the study design, outcomes of interest, and the statistical approach for studying the impact of the interventions."
