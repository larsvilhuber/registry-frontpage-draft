abstract: "This study aims to explore the potential of Islam to aid environmental protection in Indonesia. Indonesia faces severe environmental threats and more pro-environmental policies are needed to address them. However, awareness for environmental threats and public support for pro-environmental policies is low in Indonesia. Endorsement by Islamic leaders may increase support for pro-environmental policies, in particular in a country where religion plays such an important role in everyday life. This study therefore tests whether endorsement by Islamic leaders increases support for pro-environmental policies in Indonesia using a randomized survey experiment.  The study is conducted in two provinces in Java, Indonesia enrolling a sample of 1,159 Muslim respondents. Respondents in the treatment group are asked whether they support a pro-environmental policy proposed by Islamic leaders. Respondents in the control group are asked about their support for same pro-environmental policy but without reference to Islamic leaders. Within each village, treatment is randomized at the individual level. The study aims to provide religious institutions and policy makers with evidence on the potential of Islam for environmental protection in Indonesia."
