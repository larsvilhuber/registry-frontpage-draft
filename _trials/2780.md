abstract: "To foster job finding and avoid unemployment, German workers whose employment contract ends are in principle obliged to register as job seekers with the public employment service three months before their last day in employment. This project uses a randomized controlled trial to investigate the effects of meeting the caseworker before becoming unemployed on job search outcomes. To this end, newly registered job seekers are randomly assigned to two different treatments. Job seekers in group 1 are invited to their first meeting with their caseworker upon registering with the employment service to meet as early as possible. Job seekers in group 2, in contrast, are invited to a first meeting with their caseworker later in the job search process shortly before their last day in employment."
