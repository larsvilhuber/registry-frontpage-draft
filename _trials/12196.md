abstract: "In our earlier experiment, centered around social and AI scoring, we painted an optimistic picture of AI's introduction. Not only did we find that AI scoring systems enhance human cooperation, but individuals also demonstrated a growing acceptance of these systems, particularly as they gained more experience or encountered deteriorating cooperative environments.
However, concerns arise regarding the potential for excessive automation resulting from AI implementation. The replacement of humans by AI may lead to undesirable social consequences such as job loss, stagnant wages, and increased inequality. To address these concerns, we introduced a new treatment aimed at discussing the potential of AI restatement – a type of AI development that augments workers' productivity and creates new tasks for labor-intensive roles.
Our study delved into the dual functions of AI – replacement and reinstatement – and employed experimental methods to investigate individual preferences and their associated outcomes concerning these two AI applications."
