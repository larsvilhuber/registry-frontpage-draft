abstract: "Through a large-scale randomized experiment of approximately 5,500 water utility customers (landlords) we measure the direct impact of disconnection notices to non-paying customers, and the associated spillover effects on neighbors. We additionally provide tenants with information about account balances and payment behavior to test the effect of strengthening bottom-up accountability in low and high enforcement settings. The study builds on work exploring how to effectively expand the provision of basic services (water, electricity, sewerage) to low income areas when poor households are typically unable to bear the full costs of connection and use. Subsidies and/or lines of credit have been successful in increasing household-level access, but this can increase the debt burden of utilities and households if customers fail to pay. This, in turn, threatens the sustainability and incentives of utilities to expand access further. Combining limited ability/willingness to pay with weak and ad hoc enforcement mechanisms in informal settlements, where the majority of Kenya’s urban poor live, means that defaulting on monthly fees for water and sewer charges is the norm rather than the exception. The target population is customers of the utility - the Nairobi City Water and Sewer Company – who are typically landlords with properties that house multiple tenants where these landlords are primarily responsible for paying utility service charges.
