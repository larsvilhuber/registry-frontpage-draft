abstract: "Many Americans have a limited understanding or information about health insurance. Limited awareness of plan options, the availability of subsidies, and plan costs make enrolling and choosing plans difficult. The goal of the project is to assess whether a personalized information intervention can help health insurance marketplaces improve take-up and choice quality, and improve market stability. Specifically, the project will shed light on the following questions:
I.	What is the effect of personalized phone outreach on enrollment (take-up) and the risk mix of consumers in the marketplace?
II.	How do personalized phone calls affect consumersâ€™ decision of which plan to choose?
III.	Are personalized outbound calls particularly effective with certain hard-to-reach populations? 
IV.	Phone calls are resource intensive; what are the financial implications for the Marketplace and for the insurance market generally of a phone-based intervention to encourage take-up? "
