abstract: "As COVID-19 rapidly spreads across the world, developing countries and disadvantaged populations are at particular risk of infection and the adverse consequences associated with infection. Risk may be exacerbated by a lack of knowledge, positive attitudes and behaviors surrounding the pandemic. In this study, we propose a large-scale randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of educational interventions in addressing potential deficiencies in COVID-19 related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Approximately 8,400 low and lower-middle income youth ages 15-30 in urban areas of India are randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms: a 10-minute online, primarily information-based, educational intervention; a 22-minute online educational intervention which mostly provides the same information but includes further explanation of underlying scientific concepts; and a control group. Results are fundamental to understanding the role and nature of education in affecting behavior during the current and future pandemics."
