abstract: "The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of allowing teachers to use local context to make structured adaptations to an evidence-based online science content literacy curriculum, Model of Reading Engagement (MORE). The MORE lessons are an in-person based curriculum organized thematically to provide a framework for helping student connect new learning to a meaningful domain-specific schema. We adapt the in-person MORE curriculum to an online version to be delivered both synchronously and asynchronously. To support the students at-home learning we also provide print books and reading comprehension activities. Then within our 26 schools, we randomize teachers into two conditions: a condition where we devise a core set of implementation procedures based upon the in-person MORE and common-sense adaptation needed for an online setting, or a condition with structured adaptations.  In the adaptations condition, teachers can collaborate within their school or across schools to make practical improvements using their knowledge, experience, and local context. The randomized trial is designed to test the effectiveness of the adaptive implementation on third-graders' reading comprehension using researcher-developed transfer measures and standardized measures of broad reading comprehension."
