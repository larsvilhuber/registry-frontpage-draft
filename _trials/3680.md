abstract: "Following a recent measles outbreak, an INGO in partnership with a UN agency supported the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) launched an immunization program to vaccinate children under the age of 15 in low coverage areas.

The program employs a door-to-door outreach approach to: a) identify dropout children; b) educate and raise awareness of caretakers on the importance of immunization; c) collect and record data via an online application; and d) distribute vaccination vouchers and refer eligible children (dropout children under 15 years old) to the nearest primary healthcare center (PHC) or dispensary.

Despite the successful implementation of the program in 240 cadastres, reaching out to around 193,450 children, several challenges were identified, including ones that have strong behavioral roots (e.g. lack of trust in the quality of vaccines offered by the PHCs and dispensaries; neglect and/or forgetfulness of caretakers to vaccinate their children; lack of awareness that vaccination under the program is free, â€¦). These challenges, among others, have been inhibiting the uptake of vaccination among beneficiaries, even though the vaccination is being offered for free.

To complement this effort, our organisation partnered with the above parties to design, implement and evaluate a nudge to increase the uptake of vaccination. The intervention, which was piloted as a clustered Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) in seven urban cadastres for a period of two months , consisted of a behaviorally-informed calendar that combined several tools designed to address some of the most common challenges identified through in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and field observations."
