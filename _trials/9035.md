abstract: "Foundation Literacy and numeracy (FLN) is critical for a child's education. NEP recommends a set of basic literacy and numeracy skills to be acquired by Grade 3. These requirements are not met in many districts in India for various reasons. Here, in a field experiment, we plan to remotely test an intervention targeted at parents by providing them simple activities to do with their children that improve math and Hindi skills. Activities are presented either through a WhatsApp group of parents; or by providing them with a workbook with similar activities."
