abstract: "We study preference-aggregation and paternalistic-intervention decisions of elected politicians and how they compare to decisions of “the people” they represent. We make use of paradigms developed in laboratory research by Ambuehl et al. (2021) and Ambuehl and Bernheim (2021) in a survey with federal and state politicians in Germany and a population sample to observe how the two groups resolve these two common normative questions of welfare economics. Thereby, we plan to understand whether and why politicians differ in the way they aggregate others' preferences and choose paternalistically from "the people". If there are differences between the politicians' normative choices and those made by members of the electorate, a question is whether representative Germans are happy to delegate such choices to politicians, or whether they would instead prefer them to be made by less highly selected members of the German population. This question is addressed using delegation choices of the electorate. "
