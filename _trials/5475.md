abstract: "Violence against health workers is an important problem worldwide and in particular in developing countries. A number of recent studies describe this issue in Karachi, Pakistan, where the problem seems to be particularly large (Baig et al. 2018; Zafar et al. 2014, Nayyer-ul-Islam & Faroog, 2014)(L. A. Baig et al., 2018). Baseline data indicates that the main source of violence against health staff is patients’ attendants and their trust in the hospital staff. We use a commitment device to tackle the issue of violence. The psychological mechanism behind the commitment device is base on cognitive dissonance theory. Which says that commitments  set the stage for subsequent consistent behavior (Cialdini 2007, 67). Therefore, this research tests whether a mutual commitment from hospital staff and patients’ attendants is effective in preventing or reducing violence/aggressive behavior against health care staff."
