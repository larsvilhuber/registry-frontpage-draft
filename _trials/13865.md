abstract: "Despite extensive research on the impact of various bonus structures, little is known about why firms choose different structures and the extent to which they understand the implications of choosing different contracts in practice. This project aims to determine the optimal incentives for motivating workers and to assess whether the incentives that managers and workers believe to be effective are actually optimal in practice. 

We explore four key research questions: 
(1) Which incentive schemes do managers and workers perceive to work best and why? 
(2) What is the extent of disagreement between managers and workers about their preferred contracts? 
(3) What incentives work best in practice?
(4) How well do managers' and workers' predictions align with actual outcomes? What leads individuals to be able to better predict what contracts will work well?

The study will consist of two main parts: a baseline survey and a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The baseline survey will determine managers' and workers' preferred contracts and the extent of their agreement. The RCT will test the impact of different contract structures on worker output and the sophistication of managers and workers in understanding these impacts. The intervention will involve randomizing different contract schemes -- derived based on managers and workers preferences -- across retail mobile money agents in Ghana and evaluating their performance effects using detailed administrative transaction data.

We implement an at-scale nationwide randomized experiment in partnership with the largest mobile money service provider in Ghana that (i) provides mobile money financial services nationwide with 95 percent market share spanning both rural and urban areas, (ii) has a multi-layered management hierarchy, where managers at different levels are in charge of different tasks such as commercialization, sales, and incentives design across the country, and (iii) employs incentive contracts to motivate workers, who in this context are retail agents acting as representatives of the service provider to directly handle mobile money transactions with customers. Their operations are akin to tellers in retail banking branches more commonly seen in developed countries (Annan JPE Forthcoming). These retail agents are compensated according to a formula, which effectively stipulates the relationship between output and rewards for the agents. The service provider unilaterally determines the contract. Thus, agents take the contract as given and exert optimal efforts. "
