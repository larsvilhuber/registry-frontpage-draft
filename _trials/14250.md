abstract: "Access to credit is critical for business productivity and growth. Female entrepreneurs in Sub-Saharan Africa primarily access credit through small loans from microfinance institutions, and in Ethiopia, most women do so through group lending. Evidence suggests that the impact of these small loans on business outcomes has been limited. However, growing a business may require larger investments to address fixed costs.  Nearly all larger, individual liability loans require the borrower to pledge collateral, which most women are unable to provide. We evaluate a graduation program that allows women with successful repayment histories in group loans to access uncollateralized, individual-liability loans up to 10 times larger. We explore whether such programs can expand access to credit in a manner that is sustainable for microfinance institutions."
