abstract: "Understanding preferences for distribution and inequality acceptance in environments with uncertainty about the cause of inequality is key to designing redistributive policies. In this project, I will use a laboratory experiment to study how uncertainty about the role luck and effort play in determining income affects redistribution, and how people use this uncertainty to excuse behavior not aligned with their fairness views in favor of self-interest."
