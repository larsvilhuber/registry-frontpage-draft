abstract: "In the absence of complete information about individual characteristics, rational employers might systematically discriminate against workers from given identity groups. We develop a model in which employers are either bayesian updaters or conservatives. We theoretically show that, if the share of conservative employers is sufficiently high, minority workers might be more discriminated against than with bayesian updaters. The pre-registered experiment tests this hypothesis."
