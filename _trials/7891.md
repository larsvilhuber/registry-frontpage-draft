abstract: "In a multinational industrial company, we implement a nudge reminding supervisors that they can reward extraordinary performance with financial spot bonuses during the entire year, and not only at the end of the year. We investigate whether this nudge shifts the timing of financial spot bonuses in the second half of 2021. In particular, we are interested in whether nudged supervisors award more spot bonuses in the third quarter of 2021 compared to supervisors who have not been nudged."
