abstract: "We investigate the impact of central banks communicating uncertainty on investor expectation formation and on market price dynamics. In a lab experiment, we vary the type of and the source of uncertainty central banks communicated and form a 2 by 2 design, i.e., 2 types of communicated uncertainty (communicating risk vs. communicating ambiguity) X 2 sources of communicated uncertainty (communicating uncertainty from policy implementation source vs. policy intensity source). With this design, we are able to examine the difference of impact between communicating risk and communicating ambiguity within each source. Furthermore, between different sources of uncertainty, we are able to examine the difference of impact between communicating uncertainty from the policy implementation source and communicating uncertainty from the policy intensity source. Finally, we are also able to examine the difference between communicating risk and communicating ambiguity in different sources."
