abstract: "The adoption of AI in decision-making has seen rapid advances, especially in the context of the hiring process (Chalfin et al., 2016; Raghavan et al., 2020). Algorithms can accelerate the hiring process as well as improve the efficiency. However, ethical concerns have emerged due to potential bias and discrimination in hiring, posing more risks to vulnerable groups (Obermeyer et al., 2019; Giermindl et al., 2022). This project aims to comprehend how individuals adapt to and interact with algorithms in the labor market, focusing on how workers and HR managers interact with hiring algorithms. To achieve this goal, we will conduct several online, and lab experiments and collect data from the students population in the Netherlands as well as workers in online labor markets (i.e. Mturk, Prolifics) from the US and UK. In particular, this study serves as a pilot to initiate the previously mentioned project."
