abstract: "Improving the matching of students to schools has been the subject of much research in recent years. Since school choice can have a long-lasting educational impact on individualsâ€™ lives, the mechanism determining the matching should be chosen with care. One property that researchers and policymakers have agreed on being desirable is that the matching mechanism in an educational setting should be strategy-proof in order to give applicants fair chances to submit their preferences over schools. Faced with a strategy-proof matching mechanism, it is a (weakly) dominant strategy for applicants to submit their true preferences. However, empirical evidence has shown that people fail to understand strategy-proofness and instead try to strategically manipulate their preference submissions. 
Two common mechanisms that fulfill this property are the Deferred-Acceptance (DA) mechanism and the Top Trading Cycles (TTC) mechanism. The discussion around which mechanism is best to implement often favors the DA mechanism. Much of the research is concerned with making strategy-proofness clearer to applicants and to adjust the application procedure to facilitate truthful preference submission. What is less clear, however, is how good individuals are at learning how to participate in either mechanism. What if it turns out that individuals are much better at learning how to participate in the TTC than the DA mechanism? Since parents often have to make school choice decisions multiple times (e.g., for several levels of education such as kindergarten, primary school, secondary school, etc., or if they have more than one child), the comprehension of learning effects allows for a broader overall understanding of how people behave in these decisions.
This project aims to investigate learning effects in a laboratory experiment and to re-evaluate the DA and TTC mechanism in terms of comprehensibility and learning behavior. In 20 rounds, students are matched in groups of four and have to decide on their preference submissions in an artificial school choice setting where they compete over four schools. The matching outcome is determined by either the DA or the TTC mechanism. In addition to comparing learning effects in the DA versus TTC mechanism, measured as increases in truth-telling rates, in a second treatment variation advice is added on the dominant strategy (submitting preferences truthfully). This allows for an analysis of the extent to which improvements are due to learning versus advice. A subsequent survey on subjects' strategies, and economic and socio-economic preferences is intended to help deepen the understanding of the findings.
