abstract: "Absence of cold storage facilities can negatively impact farmers and traders through multiple channels - loss of produce, lower quality of produce, or being forced to sell any perishable produce that remains unsold during hotter times of the day at lower prices to avoid further losses. As temperatures get hotter, cooling solutions for storing produce at agricultural markets could enhance farmer income by increasing the price received and eliminating spoilage losses. Our randomized control evaluation will provide better access to cold-storage facilities to treated traders relative to the control group through a subsidy to use the facility, as well as weather forecasts that allow farmers to better make use of the coldroom access across markets in three districts of Odisha, India. We will measure how access to solar-powered cold-storage infrastructure and weather forecasts influences agricultural trade in terms of price and quantities sold, traders' profits, and any market-level aggregate effects."
