abstract: "A randomized experiment with 225 small and medium enterprises is used to test the impact of a program that has the main goal of helping firms to attract new customers, expand markets, adapt their business model, and bounce back from the COVID-19 pandemic by boosting demand for their products, thereby potentially making the firms more attractive to investors."
