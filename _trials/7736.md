abstract: "There is growing evidence that pretrial detention worsens both criminal justice and labor market outcomes: for those on the margin of being detained while awaiting trial, pretrial detention increases the likelihood of conviction and decreases both employment and the receipt of government benefits (Dobbie et al., 2018; Stevenson, 2018, Leslie and Pope, 2017). Many who are detained pretrial would be released if they could post bail; not being able to afford bail might then have detrimental long-term consequences that are costly to that individual and to society. As those detained are predominantly low-income individuals, posting bail becomes a significant financial shock. One possible solution to this is bail cost-sharing: for a monthly fee, individuals will be guaranteed that bail will be paid quickly upon arrest. We conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of bail cost-sharing on individual outcomes, such as incidence of arrest and days incarcerated."
