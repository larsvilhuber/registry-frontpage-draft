abstract: "We examined the impact of self-set goals on students' academic efforts and performance in a classroom intervention conducted at two European universities. Students were randomly assigned to a control group and two treatment groups. In the treatment groups, participants set a performance goal for their final course exam, and in one treatment, they could earn a monetary reward if they achieved their goals. Students in the control group did not set any performance goals.
