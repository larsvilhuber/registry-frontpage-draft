abstract: "The mNutrition intervention–described in more detail below–is part of a global initiative supported by DFID to use mobile technology to improve the health and nutritional status of children and adults across the developing world. The primary research goals are: (1) to measure the impacts and cost-effectiveness of mNutrition on women's and children's dietary diversity; (2) test whether mNutrition improves Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices; (3) explore whether mNutrition improves nutritional status for children under twelve months of age. In addition, the project will examine the following secondary research topics: (4) does mNutrition increase nutrition knowledge, including knowledge of IYCF practices, among pregnant women and caregivers of children under twelve months of age; (5) does sending mNutrition content to the mobile phones of both women–either pregnant women or the mothers of children under twelve months of age–and their spouses have any additional impact on the other primary and secondary research questions?"
