abstract: "We elicit voters’ beliefs about the closeness of the election and their ambiguity attitudes towards uncertainty of the outcomes of the 2020 presidential election in USA. We present different information to prime people’s perceived ambiguity of the election results. We provide the first test of the impact of pivotality in turnout by carefully controlling ambiguity attitudes at the same time. "
