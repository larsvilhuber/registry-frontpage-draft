abstract: "In this paper, we shed light on the causal effects of policy announcements in terms of information on planned transport policy measures that render driving less attractive. We expect that providing information on changing transportation policies (making driving less attractive or more expensive) will trigger a (hypothetical) behavioral change in mode choice toward less motorized individual transportation options.
Furthermore, we examine whether the effects of the policy announcements depend on trust in political institutions and (governing) parties.
