abstract: "The project aims to improve primary school students’ academic achievement by changing students’ troublesome behavior at school. We will carry out a pair-matched, cluster-randomized trial in which whole primary school classrooms (N=148) are randomized either to the treated or to the control condition. Both groups will receive an intervention that consists of two parts. Part one involves only information, while part two is participation in a 50-day campaign aimed at maintaining students’ awareness of the issue. Treated and control students differ in terms of the content of the intervention they will receive. Treated students will receive information about the negative consequences of troublesome school behavior. They will also participate in a 50-day campaign in which they will collect points (offline and online) if they avoid engaging in troublesome school behavior. Control students will receive information about the negative consequences of unhealthy food with the accompanying 50-day campaign. We will assess the treatment effect by comparing the change in students’ GPA and test scores (primary outcomes) across treated and control students. Our secondary outcomes are students’ self-reported and teacher-reported behavior, and students’ self-control as observed in real choice situations."
