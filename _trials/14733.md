abstract: "A large share of interventions in development, education, and workforce development organizations involve non-governmental organizations (NGOs) or civil society organizations. This project randomly assigns NGOs that share a common funder into community organizations to study the effect of networks on organizational performance. These NGOs will send representatives to monthly meetings wherein they will discuss  partnerships, how to best use volunteers, and monitoring/evaluation among other topics.  This project seeks to understand whether randomly induced peer-learning across NGOs can improve outcomes for both for the funder and for the funded NGOs. "
