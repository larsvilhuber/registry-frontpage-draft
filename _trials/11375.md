abstract: "European countries use a variety of strategies to deter irregular migration from Africa across the Mediterranean into Europe. This includes information campaigns directed at potential migrants, often funded by EU countries and implemented by government agencies in African countries of origin. A number of studies have analyzed the impact of such information campaigns on migration intentions. This study complements the existing literature on information campaigns by analyzing how this type of information affects attitudes towards migrants in transit communities in Africa."
