abstract: "Evidence from previous studies suggests that attitudes to inequality and preferences for redistribution are influenced by the perceived fairness of the source of inequality. Specifically, several studies have found that inequality resulting from differences in performance (or hard work) is more accepted than inequality due to luck or factors outside of individual control. This study uses an economic experiment to test whether varying the source of inequality affects how individuals make distribution decisions, thus addressing the question: ‘Does the source of inequality, in particular merit or luck, affect preferences for redistribution?’
Moreover, we extend the analysis to consider changes in behaviour due to strategic interaction with other participants. In line with previous studies showing that pro-social behaviour is affected by the observation of others behaving pro-socially, we ask a similar question in the context of preferences for redistribution: ‘Does exposure to peer preferences affect decisions to redistribute?’
We implement this economic experiment together with other games and a survey to collect background information on participants in both Mozambique and Vietnam.
More details are presented in the pre-analysis plan.
