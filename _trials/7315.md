abstract: "One of the key determinants of commitment demand is perceived present bias. The direction and magnitude of the effect of informing individuals of their present bias are ambiguous and remain an empirical question. The effect of correcting beliefs on present bias on commitment demand is an important determinant of whether commitment devices are an appropriate policy tool, and whether their success depends on improving self awareness of present bias. I will study the effect of updating beliefs about present bias on commitment demand in the setting of decisions to volunteer. Volunteering has been shown to be strongly associated with improved happiness and subjective well-being; however, the "warm glow" of prosocial behavior often comes after costly effort, making the decision to volunteer susceptible to present bias. This study will therefore also provide insight into how to improve both volunteerism rates and subjective well-being of individuals."
