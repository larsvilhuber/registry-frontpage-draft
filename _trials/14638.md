abstract: "The retail sector intermediates between the demands of consumers and the products of suppliers. This project will study whether the sourcing decisions of retailers—in particular, the efficiency of their search for cheaper suppliers—plays a quantitatively meaningful role in the allocation of resources across firms in upstream sectors. The final stage of the project is a randomized-controlled trial that will measure the impact of giving small retailers information about prices charged by suppliers. Treated shops will receive either general information about the distribution of prices, or specific price quotes and contact information for low-cost suppliers.  "
