abstract: "This is an experimental study of producer attitudes to output price risk and ambiguity. Strictly speaking, these are framed field experiments, or “lab-in-the-field” experiments, wherein we have farmers play games which we initially designed for a lab environment, and which cast experimental subjects in the role of agricultural producers. The experiments will be run in Peru, in rural areas surrounding Lima, the capital, in collaboration with Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA). We aim for a sample size of n=96 subjects split into two equal groups of 48 subjects who will be playing price risk games and price ambiguity games."
