abstract: "Access to the formal legal system is limited in developing countries, which affects investment and economic development. In this project, we test the effects of a “remote legal aid” initiative, whereby legal aid is offered online to small-scale farmers involved in property rights disputes. This program may improve legal knowledge, access to courts, the security of property rights, and investment. This note describes the pre-analysis plan for this intervention."
