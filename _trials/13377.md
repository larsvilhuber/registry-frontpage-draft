abstract: "In this project, we collaborate with a crop insurance consortium in Uganda and experimentally study the demand for multi-season insurance contracts among smallholder farmers in Uganda. We focus on insurance products with ex-post premiums (“Pay-at-Harvest Insurance”).  We investigate whether farmers demand multi-season insurance, whether they want to have the option to cancel after the first season or a commitment to take up for two seasons, and possible mechanisms for the commitment demand. In addition, we will study the effect on insurance demand of a randomized information intervention that aims to make farmers aware of the state-dependent nature of their farming activities and the possible state-dependency of their demand for insurance."
