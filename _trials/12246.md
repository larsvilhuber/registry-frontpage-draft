abstract: "We measure the impact of a large-scale, multi-faceted social protection program, the Social Support for Resilience Livelihoods Project (SSRLP) in Malawi, a government-led initiative implemented by the Community Savings and Investment Promotion (COMSIP). Using two distinct randomized controlled trials, we assess the effects of various livelihood support packages on households participating in either the government's Social Cash Transfer (SCT) program or the Climate-Smart Enhanced Public Works Program (CSEPWP). In Experiment 1, Savings and Loan Group clusters that have successfully completed a series of basic trainings are randomized to receive no additional support or one of three program versions: an "enhanced" program that includes skill training and a seed input subsidy; a "graduation" program with coaching, livelihood training, and an asset transfer; or both. In Experiment 2, we measure the impact of one element of the "enhanced" program—the Youth Skills Challenge (YSC)—which provides training and an asset transfer to support livelihood development—by randomly assigning top applicants to a treatment or control group. We evaluate the impacts of these sets of interventions on key outcomes such as income, consumption, food security, and resilience against economic shocks.
