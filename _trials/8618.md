abstract: "This impact evaluation will study changes in subsidy delivery modality for tree spraying pesticides in the cashew sector in Mozambique, measuring the change from quota-based distribution of pesticides to intermediaries (sprayers) to voucher-based distribution of pesticides to intermediaries, where farmers submit vouchers with intermediaries of their choice who in turn submit these vouchers to input distributors. While the subsidy was put in place by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MADER) to revitalize the Mozambican cashew sector, government budgetary constraints have motivated a gradual phase out of the current quota system. This IE evaluates the current proposed approach - shifting from free distribution to vouchers, and then slowly shrinking the rate of subsidy farmers receive from the voucher. However, the transition from quota-based distribution to vouchers introduces additional logistical challenges - this IE aims to isolate the resulting impact of the change in modality on the set of farmers covered."
