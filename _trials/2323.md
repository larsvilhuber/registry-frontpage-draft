abstract: "This study investigates recall error by comparing sales figures given by the farmers in a survey, with administrative data from agriculture marketing cooperatives (AMCOs). AMCOs that have complete records for cashew nuts with information about the date of the sale, how many kilograms each member sold and at what price, are selected. One AMCO can have several branches, and from each branch 16 farmers that are producing cashew nuts are randomly selected from the membership list. Our sample consist of 488 farmers from the Mtwara region in Tanzania."
