abstract: "Severe malnutrition, especially amongst children, is a persistent problem in India. Using a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) design, we propose to measure the efficacy of a kitchen garden based intervention in addressing the problem. We propose to train and incentivize
women in rural households to raise a small kitchen garden. If found effective, this intervention can easily be scaled up for implementation as a policy to improve nutritional outcomes, particularly in the event of an adverse shock to income."
