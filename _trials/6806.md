abstract: "With everything happening virtually, we are removed from the process through which goods and services are produced. To make matters worse, in most real-world situations, outcome is a noisy function of effort. Despite working hard, the person providing effort gets blamed because of bad luck. We believe that inducing empathy - the capacity to imagine oneself in someone else’s position  - may allow the principal to see the agent’s good intentions and separate agents’ intention from the outcome. If our experiment finds this to be true, it suggests that ways to add back the first person perspective to these no-touch goods and service delivery may be integral in economic and social activities that are supported by prosocial behavior.
