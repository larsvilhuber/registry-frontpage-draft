abstract: "Parents make many choices for their children throughout childhood and adolescence. Parents' choices may be important in shaping children's outcomes and personality, yet the topic has received little attention in prior research. I study parents' competitiveness choices for their adolescent children. I conduct experiments on parents and children (age 15), where parents make a real competitiveness choice for their child, and children also make their own competitiveness choices. The experimental data is combined with administrative data on parents' income and education, and children's education.
