abstract: "This project studies the impact of radio on information, misinformation, and preventive behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic in rural Burkina Faso. We use an experiment implemented in 2017 in which a random sample of women who had no radio were given a radio to identify the causal effect of additional exposure to radio content during the COVID-19 crisis. Our main outcomes will be measured using a phone survey planned for September 2020, arround 6 months after the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in Burkina Faso.
