abstract: "We examine the effects of government spending on household consumption and macroeconomic expectations through an information provision experiment. We experimentally shift expectations about the growth of government consumption and investment spending using forecasts from the Survey of Professional Forecasters. First, we examine the quality of households' fiscal expectations compared to professional forecasters and evaluate the extent to which households update their expectations upon receiving information about the expected fiscal stance. Second, we estimate the impact of the fiscal news shock on the intra-individual change between past household consumption in 2024 and expected household consumption in 2025. Additionally, we analyze qualitative changes in consumer behavior and income expectations. We then explore whether households associate the fiscal news shock with inflation and increased taxation in both the short and long run. Finally, we use open-ended questions to explore how individuals relate the fiscal stance to their own economic behavior and expectations. We use a follow-up survey to ascertain whether the effects persisted over time."
