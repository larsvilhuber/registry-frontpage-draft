abstract: "This study seeks to explore how people make decisions involving risk when it comes to two different types of goods: money and food. In particular, we are interested in understanding higher-order risk preferences, such as prudence (the tendency to be cautious about potential risks) and temperance (the ability to moderate risk-taking), when individuals are faced with choices that involve either monetary rewards or food items in a controlled laboratory setting.

In this study, participants are asked to make binary decisions between lotteries. We use the risk apportionment tasks of Deck et al. (2023) to measure prudence and temperance along with risk aversion. Subjects are asked to make lottery choices between either monetary rewards or food item rewards on a within-subjects basis. To study how risk preferences differ based on the type of food, participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group will make decisions in lotteries where the food rewards are healthy items (such as cheese), while the other group will face lotteries where the food rewards are unhealthy items (such as chocolates).

The results of this study will help us understand how people weigh risks when it comes to different types of goods, which could provide insights into economic and health-related decision-making.
