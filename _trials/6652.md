abstract: "We explore the underlying preferences and beliefs that contribute to the peer culture of misbehavior within a Youth Reformative Training Center (RTC). First, we assess individual preferences regarding the desirability of such offenses and perceptions of others' attitudes toward these behaviors. Next, we implement a population-level randomized control trial, providing youths with accurate information about actual attitudes toward offenses. Finally, we evaluate the effect of this informational intervention on the incidence of misbehavior within the RTC."
