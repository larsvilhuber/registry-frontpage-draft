abstract: "This project aims to promote effective parenting practices through the Jamaica Home Visiting program (Reach Up), and compare the effect with a monetary transfer.

This project will be implemented in 6 areas across the country, including Chiang Mai in the north, Khon Kean in the northeast, Mahasarakham and Kalasin in the northeast, Lop Buri in the central, Nakhon Nayok in the central, and Pattaluk and Songkla in the south. Note that the northeast is the poorest region while the south is where a significant fraction of the population is Muslim.

In each area, we will choose 12-15 subdistricts, each consisting of several villages. Each subdistrict has at least one childcare center, which usually consists of two levels of classes: (1) class of younger children (2-3 years of age at the beginning of the academic year, 16th of May) and (2) class of older children (4-3 years of age). Since the Reach Up program applies to children no older than 4 years old, we randomly chose our sample from the younger class only (except childcare centers with only mixed-age classrooms). 

The randomization unit is a subdistrict. We will first rank subdistricts by the number of potential samples in the subdistrict and then form groups of three based on the ranking. We randomly assigned each group to the control and two treatment groups. 

Research questions include: (i) Can the Jamaica Home Visiting program (Reach Up) improve child skills; (ii) can the Jamaica Home Visiting program (Reach Up) improve parenting quality/investment; (iii) can the monetary transfer improve child skills; (iv) can the monetary transfer increase parental investment.
