abstract: "Mathematical olympiads are widely recognized as an effective way to identify STEM
talent. However, many talented students do not participate, either because they are
unaware of the contests or because financial barriers (e.g., enrollment fees and travel
costs) prevent them from participating. As a result, many students with extraordinary
abilities are currently being overlooked. Colombia has a well-established math olympiad program with a track record of success
in international competitions. We propose a randomized controlled trial to study two
interventions expanding access to the program, aimed at students whose schools do
not currently offer the qualifying exam and those who cannot afford to travel for the
semifinals and finals. This experiment will allow us to study (1) the efficacy of cost
waivers and other low-cost interventions in expanding access to olympiads and their
associated education opportunities and (2) the effect of math contest participation on
outcomes, including college choice and intended major."
