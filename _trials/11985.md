abstract: "The unsafe level of arsenic contamination in drinking water is a global phenomenon. However, Bangladesh ranks first in terms of magnitude among the four major arsenic calamities reported so far. We conducted a randomized controlled trial in Bangladesh to examine the extent to which a public information campaign, similar to the one conducted by the Bangladesh Government, is effective at reducing households' exposure to arsenic.

The campaign involved the free examination of all tube wells (TWs), which are the primary sources of drinking water, for arsenic. The TWs were then labeled as either safe or unsafe based on the level of arsenic found in the water. We added an additional layer to the government campaign: in two-thirds of our study villages, we provided information at the household level regarding the effects of unsafe levels of arsenic in TW water on health and well-being.

In addition to the household-level information, approximately in half of the villages, we elicited households' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a water arsenic filter. To address liquidity constraints that may prevent upfront payments, in half of the randomly assigned villages where WTP was elicited, households were offered the option to purchase the filter on credit provided by local microfinance institutions (MFIs).

We measured households' health, including symptoms linked to arsenic poisoning, subjective well-being, and their WTP for a water arsenic filter. Additionally, we collected a comprehensive set of demographic and socio-economic measures, including poverty status."
