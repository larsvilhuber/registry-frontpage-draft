abstract: "Background: Injection of local anesthesia during dental procedures can induce metabolic changes. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the changes of blood glucose serum level after injection of lidocaein with vasoconstrictor during Tooth Extraction
Materials and Methods: In this clinical trial study, we enrolled 60 patients. We extracted mandibular teeth by using inferior alveolar nerve block. We took a finger blood sample test from each enrolled patient immediately before and 10 minutes after local anesthesia. Anesthetic solution (1.8 ml carpule) contained lidocaine and 1:80,000 epinephrine. It was injected through inferior alveolar nerve after negative aspiration. Only one carpule injected into all patients. This study is approved by ethics committee of the research center of Azad University of Medical Sciences
Results: Mean age in our study was 39.54 ± 15 years old. 35 patients were male and 25 were female. The blood glucose serum level was 111.6 ± 25.47 mg/dl before local anesthesia and 115.3 ± 24.39 mg/dl after tooth extraction (P = 0.418). 11 female patient’s and 4 male patients had blood glucose level reduction after injection. There was a significant difference between groups (P = 0.01).
Conclusion: according to our findings and previous reports, using local anesthesia during teeth extraction doesn’t induce hypoglycemia and it could increase the blood glucose serum level in individuals.
