abstract: "While psychological research demonstrated the prevalence of stereotypes and biases, no research so far has combined the context of information avoidance and inaccurate statistical discrimination into one framework to analyze these two phenomena one against another. Our objective is to fill this gap. We designed an experiment that tests whether providing information about previous performance (an indicator of an individualâ€™s productivity), affects the split of resources between female and male managers. The experiment is set in the context of the NGO involved in providing humanitarian aid."
