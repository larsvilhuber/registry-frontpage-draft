abstract: "We explored the potential benefits of digital financial education programs among Hispanic
populations, through the design and evaluation of a mobile phone delivered digital program
called Mind Your Money (MYM). This program sought to improve financial capability and
reduce financial stress among low-to-moderate income Hispanics residing in the Greater Los
Angeles area. We assessed the program through a randomized controlled trial with a wait-list
control group. Our digital financial education program had a high retention rate and a positive
statistical significant effect on financial capability. Participants who completed program
activities were more likely to have a budget/spending plan and felt more confident about their
ability to pay for unexpected expenses. We also find that those in the treatment group show
lower levels of financial stress than did those in the control group.
