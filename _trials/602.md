abstract: "The ability of the state to maintain trust with its citizens is a challenge in emerging economies. The proposed study examines how perceptions of relative state effectiveness determine a citizen's engagement with state and non-state actors. The first component of the study introduces a range of "exposure treatments" to individuals in Pakistan, a country that offers an excellent study context. The treatments vary from information provision about state and non-state initiatives versus a placebo information treatment. The study tests whether these interventions change a citizens' beliefs and attitudes towards state and non-state actors. 

The second component of the study will offer several levels of intensity of treatment -- from pure information, to demonstration, to facilitating access to state services. We will then measure the change in citizens' beliefs and attitudes along with impacts on the citizensâ€™ actual engagement with each actor. These ideas raise the possibility of a two-way feedback between the effectiveness of the state and citizens' attitudes towards it."
