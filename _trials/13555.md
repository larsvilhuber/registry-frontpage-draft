abstract: "Women worldwide face hurdles integrating into male-dominated professions, be it finance, technology, economics, or politics. Difficult work environments might prevent women from advancing in such workplaces, or even drop out. These problems are exacerbated in India, where women’s labor force participation rates are abysmally low to begin with (~20%), and even lower in professions like the police (~10%). Though the police constable position is considered to be an attractive job, many women drop out at various stages of the recruitment process, as well as after starting their first posting. Yet women’s role in the police is critical, as shown in multiple studies. In partnership with the Madhya Pradesh state police, we evaluate interventions designed to mitigate female constables’ social and professional isolation in a male-dominated work environment, and ideally improve retention and advancement. Using a mixed-methods approach – combining qualitative fieldwork, surveys, and randomized evaluation – we study the impacts of providing mentorship or peer support to new women recruits during their first posting."
