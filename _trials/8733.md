abstract: "We conduct a survey experiment for supermarkets consumers in China to measure individual's economic rationality in risk preference, social preference domain and food preference domains. Our prior research has shown the inconsistency between rationality in risk preference measured in the survey experiment and rationality stemmed from scanner data. Therefore, we design this survey experiment  to examine the underlying mechanism of such inconsistency and validate the cross validity of rationality measurements. "
