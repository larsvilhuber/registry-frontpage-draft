abstract: "This project concerns moral behavior and how observed choices relate to moral orientation. We study experimentally situations where the two most influential moral theories, consequentialism and deontological ethics, distinguish themselves sharply on their directives regarding the morally right action. By observing behavior in the different situations, we investigate how choices vary between the different situations, as well as how behavior in these situations relates to general economic preferences and judgment obtained from hypothetical questionnaires."
