abstract: "Researchers have extensively documented cognitive skill gaps by socioeconomic status in the early childhood years. The fact that these gaps emerge before formal schooling and are at their widest around age five suggests the importance of home environments, early investments, and parenting in fostering early skills. Rigorous evidence from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrates that Ready4K programming, a text message-based developmental curriculum for parents of young children, leads to changes in parent practices and student learning gains (York & Loeb 2014). A follow-up RCT study with kindergarten students documented larger learning gains when messages were tailored to studentsâ€™ instructional levels (Doss, Fahle, Loeb & York 2017). The current study builds on the previous research that shows text messaging to parents can support literacy and narrow early skills gaps, by investigating the impact of a new, supplemental summer program that will provide text messages to parents during the summer before their children enter kindergarten. The primary outcome measure will be school-entry assessment scores in the fall of the kindergarten year. In the future, we plan to follow the children in this study to quantify any long-term improvements in cognitive skills, as measured by performance on standardized reading and mathematics assessments in third grade."
