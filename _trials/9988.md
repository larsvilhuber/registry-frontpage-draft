abstract: "A non-negligible fraction of men in the US are non-custodial fathers, and pay child support to maintain their children who do not live in their households. This study investigates the preferences of these fathers over the consumption of the children that they pay support for. We field a vignette survey experiment to a sample of such fathers obtained through an online survey panel. The vignettes randomize the consumption amounts allocated to these children and their current family, to allow estimation of preferences over how much these children consume vis-a-vis their current families.
