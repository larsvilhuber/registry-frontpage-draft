abstract: "College and major choices have important implications for one’s labor market outcomes. These choices are often hampered by information friction. We conduct a randomized experiment in Southwest China on Grade-12 students before they apply for colleges in the centralized application procedure, which requires a student to apply for specific college-major pairs. The experiment provides treated students with information on expected wages or noncognitive skill requirements of jobs held by college workers of various majors. We investigate the extent to which students’ beliefs are biased and how information intervention can affect their college-major choices."
