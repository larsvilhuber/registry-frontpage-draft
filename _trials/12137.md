abstract: "The main objective of this experiment is to gain insights into the behaviours and choices of electric car owners when presented with different incentive schemes for utilising a workplace charging station. Specifically, we study various configurations of a system of credits for charging electric cars at the PRISM charging station at the European Commission's Joint Research Center (JRC) in Ispra. PRISM is an experimental platform with multiple charging points, allowing JRC employees to charge their vehicles for free in exchange for anonymised data about their behaviours. Within this context, incentives are necessary to ensure an efficient and fair use of the stations at the workplace. By exploring diverse credit configurations and observing user responses, this study aims to enhance our understanding of how such incentive structures impact EV charging behaviours, user preferences, and the overall integration of electric vehicles into the daily commute."
