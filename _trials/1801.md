abstract: "The objective of the research is to study the political participation of (international) migrants and we are particularly interested in the impact of messaging on voter registration and turnout. The GOTV literature has focused on testing rational choice and social psychological theories and finds that social pressure, pride, and shaming messages have large effects. However, much of this literature is US- and Europe-centric. On the other hand, there's an active literature that has studied the motivations for turnout in the Indian context but these havenâ€™t been experimentally evaluated. 

We hope that our study will lie at the intersection of these two literatures. We wish to empirically examine the causal impact of an informational campaign that not only emphasizes the messages noted in the academic literature but to also test for the effect of patriotism (by invoking the image of the national flag) on participation.
