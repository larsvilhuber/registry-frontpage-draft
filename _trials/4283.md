abstract: "In his seminal paper, Andreoni (1995) has shown in a laboratory experiment that framing the contribution to a public good as a positive externality leads to larger contributions to the public good than framing non-contribution as a negative externality.  He refers to the motivation to contribute under the positive externality frame as the “Warm-Glow from doing good”, while he refers to the motivation to contribute under the negative externality frame as the avoidance of the “Cold-Prickle from doing bad”. In this paper, we test the external validity of the Andreoni (1995) findings in the field."
