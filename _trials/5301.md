abstract: "We propose a randomised controlled trial to estimate a demand curve for native vs. migrant labour and, in doing so, obtain a monetary valuation of customer preferences for different types of workers. We will deliver leaflets advertising the services (e.g., house cleaning) of several workers who only differ in their origins (native vs. migrant, as signaled by their names) to a random sample of Danish households. The hourly rate charged by the workers will be randomly varied to generate a demand schedule. In addition, we will vary the workers’ skill levels to investigate potential biases in customers´ perceptions of migrant skills. Differences in callback rates between different types of workers will be our primary outcome of interest."
