abstract: "In digital markets business decisions are increasingly taken by artificial intelligence (AI). Especially in e-commerce, a growing share of retailers uses AI-driven algorithmic pricing, whereas remaining vendors rely on manual price setting. However, policymakers have raised concerns about anti-competitive tacit collusion between humans and AI that could allow firms to soften competition. Therefore, we empirically investigate outcomes that arise when humans and AI repeatedly interact in digital markets. Based on an economic laboratory experiment in near real-time, we compare the degree of tacit collusion in duopoly markets across settings with different decision makers and settings with different degrees of algorithmic decision support for human decision makers. In a between-subjects treatment design we systematically vary (i) the decision makers in a market between humans only, algorithms only and mixed market settings where humans and algorithms compete; and (ii) whether human participants receive decision support from an AI-driven pricing algorithm. Altogether, our study sheds light on competition in digital markets where AI plays an increasingly important role and thus bears timely policy and managerial implications."
