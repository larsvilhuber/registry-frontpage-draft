abstract: "This study aims to understand the effects on womenâ€™s financial inclusion and labor market decisions during COVID-19. We collect information on women working at markets in relevant wards in Tanzania. Our sample is a representative selection of female entrepreneurs in these markets because more than 96 percent of women in our baseline sample owned the business they were working at. This will enable us to gain a clear idea of the economic impact on these women during the COVID-19 crises.
