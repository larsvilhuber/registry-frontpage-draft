abstract: "This study aims to understand the effect of COVID-19 social isolation and lockdown measures on the academic performance of Azerbaijani higher education students. At the beginning of March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Azerbaijani universities had to transition to online delivery of all courses. This was an unprecedented experience both for higher education institutes and for the entire student body, as according to Azerbaijani laws, online courses cannot be listed in academic degree plans. Therefore, neither Azerbaijani universities nor students had previous experience in online academic degree-seeking education.

The online instruction also raised questions and concerns regarding the existence and effectiveness of the relevant infrastructure at Azerbaijani universities. The prevalence of unequal access to online educational resources and means among students also became the focus of debates. Some students experienced financial problems and consequently had to leave their dorms or rented apartments for living with their parents and relatives in smaller cities and provinces. Disruptions to living arrangements also increased the gap in access to educational resources among different student groups. The gap could be more pronounced for female students who would have to live with their parents, as based on local traditions, females are supposed to undertake the largest share of household chores. 

The researchers will conduct a survey among Azerbaijani undergraduate and master students at the University of Economics (UNEC) to understand how COVID-19 isolation and lockdown measures and online educational delivery affected their academic performance."
