abstract: "Repayment rigidity has been shown to be particularly unfavorable for microfinance borrowers, especially in terms of investment potential. This study proposes an innovative way for Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) to offer repayment flexibility in microfinance contracts, which uses contract price as a screening mechanism. The underlying intuition is that offering repayment flexibility as a more expensive contract option than the standard rigid contract can work as a screening instrument for lenders, with borrowers selecting into the contract that best suits their characteristics. This, in turn, can mitigate default rates. We design and set up a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) in Uttar Pradesh, India, to test this hypothesis: in treated branches, the lender offers a flexible repayment option along with the standard rigid contract, the former being more expensive than the latter. In control branches, only the standard, rigid contract is available.
Our experimental design allows us to study two things:
-	 By focusing on treatment branch only, we can look at borrowers’ selection into flexible vis-à-vis rigid contract by linking borrowers’ characteristics with contract choice
-	 By comparing treatment (contract choice) with control (only standard contract offered), we can study the impact of offering a flexibility option on business outcomes and repayment rates.
Our work specifically focuses on the design of microfinance contracts, and in particular on the introduction of flexible repayment schedules that can be profitable for both borrowers and the lenders. Second, it studies how borrowers select into different repayment schedules, based on their sensitivity to price and behavioral characteristics (time preferences, risk aversion, financial discipline), as well as on the value they give to continuing their relationship with the lender. In order to study borrowers’ selection, our experimental design does not “exogenously” assign borrowers to a flexible contract (as, for instance, in Field et al., 2013), but allows them to choose between a rigid and a flexible schedule, which are provided simultaneously by the lender.
