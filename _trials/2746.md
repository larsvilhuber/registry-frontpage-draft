abstract: "The READS Lab at the Harvard Graduate School of Education will conduct a Randomized Controlled Trial Design to replicate the effects of a Model of Reading Engagement (MORE) on Grade 1 students’ reading engagement, concept knowledge, expository writing, and reading comprehension outcomes. MORE is a literacy intervention that provides Grade 1 students with (1) access to complex and connected science concepts; (2) comprehension instruction that integrates reading and writing; (3) support for wide reading at home; and (4) motivational supports.  The RCT aims to test the efficacy of MORE and to identify key moderators and mediators of effects on student literacy outcomes."
