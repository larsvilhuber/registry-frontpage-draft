abstract: "We propose an experimental test to examine the predictions of a theoretical model we have developed (Hamilton and Ouvrard, 2023), which bridges the literature on fair pricing with that on boycotts and activism. In our case, fair prices refer to fair pricing practices in domestic markets (towards farmers or workers for instance) or to fair trade practices in international markets (fair trade coffee for instance).

We consider a monopoly retailer that jointly exercises market power in the upstream product market and downstream consumer market. The activist/certifier makes a demand to the retailer regarding the producer's dollar share (i.e., the proportion of each dollar that directly benefits producers, with the remainder retained by the retailer) subject to costly sanctions. 

The objective of the activist/certifier is to maximize his/her payoff, which is derived from a commission paid by the producer based on his/her revenues (calculated as wholesale price multiplied by market demand).

This experiment addresses two key questions:
1.	Is activism always beneficial for producers (e.g., farmers, workers)?
2.	Do activists revise their fair pricing standards when informed of the impact on producers’ surplus?

The first question stems directly from our theoretical model, which demonstrates that under certain conditions, a fair pricing standard proposed by the activist/certifier could harm producers’ surplus, due to excess supply. The second question is designed to explore whether informing the activist/certifier about these unintended consequences could lead to adjustments in their choices, mitigating negative impacts on producers’ welfare.
