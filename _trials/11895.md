abstract: "This lab experiment investigates how different types of communication between principals and agents affect cooperation and efficiency in a setting where actions not only affect payoffs for the pair within the agency relationship, but also the earnings for an external principal-agent pair. Communication is hypothesized to impact beliefs, which in turn affects the psychological costs (e.g., guilt and lying aversion) that principals and agents feel when choosing their actions. A baseline treatment allows no communication opportunities. Two communication treatments introduce (a) a single, private message from the agent to the principal in each pair; and (b) preliminary free-form chat between both agents and principals whose payoffs are affected by actions, in addition to the single, private message in (a). Complete first- and second-order beliefs are elicited from all subjects following action choices. The experiment also elicits subjectsâ€™ risk tolerance and social value orientation."
