abstract: "Securing access to welfare entitlements remains a difficult problem for disadvantaged or minority populations around the world. In India, the flagship workfare and social protection program– Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS)– continues to face implementation challenges, limiting its effectiveness as an anti-poverty program. Despite being a self-targeted scheme on paper, poor households often find themselves excluded. We study how collective action amongst low-caste households can (a) improve access to the MGNREGS; (b) improve economic well-being and empower participating members; and (c) generate spillover effects on non-participants and the private labor market. To do this, we partner with an organization in Bihar that mobilizes citizens into ‘member groups’ that collectively take action to access their allotted benefits. The organization has plans to expand to 127 locations in the next five years and we randomize collective action campaigns within this set. The organization will target the treatment locations first and delay targeting control locations until at least one year after they have finished all treatment locations. We measure impacts using publicly available MGNREGS administrative data and surveys with member and non-member households
