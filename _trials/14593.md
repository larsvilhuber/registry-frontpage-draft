abstract: "As social media (SM) usage continues to surge among youth,  concerns about its impact on their development and well-being are growing. This research investigates the crucial role parents play in shaping their children's SM experiences. Leveraging new data sources, we aim to provide a rich account of parents' beliefs about SM's effects, their strategies for guiding their children's usage, and how parental mediating practices are associated with family characteristics and child outcomes. Moreover, this project will provide novel evidence on how to foster better parenting practices to promote young people's emotional health and strengthen parent-child bonds in the digital age. Our findings will reveal inequalities stemming from varied parental approaches and inform policies to safeguard the next generation from SM's potential risks while harnessing its benefits. As regulation proves challenging, empowering parents emerges as a vital step towards ensuring SM positively impacts youth development. "
