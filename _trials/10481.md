abstract: "Using data from an online panel survey in Germany (collected via IPSOS), I study public attitudes towards migration and social policies. First, some of the migrant groups are perceived by the public as more deserving and others are perceived as less deserving. Second, some social policies are in-kind, and some are cash transfers. Third, for attitudes about some policies, I also assign additional treatments, i.e. different characteristics to these groups. The objective is to test heterogeneity in the overall impact of the treatment. I also want to test variations in treatment effects for different groups in Germany (e.g., natives vs migrants, lower educated vs higher educated). "
