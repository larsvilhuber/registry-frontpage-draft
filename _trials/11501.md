abstract: "How can we attract the most suitable candidates for jobs that require them to be both skilled and prosocial? Is there a trade-off between attracting talented individuals and those with a strong pro-social inclination, and does this vary depending on the applicant's gender?
To explore these questions, I will design an experiment in collaboration with a Ghanaian NGO that recruits recent university graduates for their fellowship program. These fellows are then trained to become teachers, and placed in remote rural areas to teach in secondary schools.

In this experiment, participants will be randomly assigned to different treatment groups, each receiving recruitment messages with varying content. The goal of the treatments is to understand how different types of messages impact the quantity and the composition of the applicant pool.
The main outcome variables I will examine include application submission rates, the quality and measures of prosocial motivation of the applicants. I will also conduct an additional online information experiment to shed some lights on the mechanisms.
