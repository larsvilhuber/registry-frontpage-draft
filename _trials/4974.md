abstract: "In an attempt to improve health and nutrition outcomes among both pregnant women and lactating mothers (PW&LM) and infant children, the Government of India (GoI) launched the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) in 2017 to provide a conditional cash transfer (CCT) of Rs. 5,000 (~77 USD) to first-time PW&LM. As of February 2019, PMMVY had enrolled over 7.3 million beneficiaries, with over 13% of these enrollments in the state of Madhya Pradesh (MP). Our study conducts micro-evaluations of pilot interventions to improve program efficiency and implementation. The study will provide valuable feedback on program design to improve implementation of a policy-relevant cash transfer program targeting maternal health and nutrition. "
