abstract: "We are collaborating with a restaurant chain in Germany. This company offers a diverse range of beverage and food products across its numerous restaurants throughout Germany. A significant challenge faced by the company is employee theft, specifically, waiters accepting payment from customers without properly recording the transaction in their cashier systems. In our field experiment, we will implement randomized monitoring measure within these restaurants. This entails the company's internal staff visiting the restaurants to conduct pre-announced inspections. The main aim of the intervention is to reduce theft and estimate the extent to which there is theft. Moreover, we conduct an employee-survey collecting data to identify the underlying behavioral mechanisms.
