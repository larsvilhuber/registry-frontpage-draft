abstract: "We investigate how middle students perceive information on the return of education. For each degree level, we provide students the average income, average income of male and female, and profession distribution in three treatments. In addition, we test whether the students memorize the information, and how it impacts their educational expectations in 10 minutes and 3 weeks after receiving the information. "
