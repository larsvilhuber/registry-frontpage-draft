abstract: "In many economic decision situations people are forced to make intertemporal trade-offs between costs and benefits occurring at different points in time. Numerous studies, both theoretically and empirically, have investigated these trade-offs in the context of individual decision making in which choices only affect oneself. The timing of when costs and benefits realize, however, is also important in strategic decision situations in which outcomes are interdependent. For instance, the challenges of climate change are not only characterized by a conflict of interest between individual and social efficiency, but also by the fact that the costs and benefits of the collective action occur at different points in time. Yet, so far relatively little is known about cooperative behavior in settings in which the social and the time dimension operate at the same time.
This study strives to gain insights into this question by investigating how delaying the benefits of cooperation affects collective action. It builds on a recent paper by Kölle and Lauer (2018) who find that delaying the costs (benefits) of cooperation by 12 months substantially reduces (increases) cooperation. The authors focus on a series of one-shot games to isolate the different underlying mechanisms. Many human interactions outside the lab, however, take place in repeated contexts, in which factors like reputational concerns or learning affect behavior, too. Previous evidence from static contexts shows that while cooperation typically starts out high at the beginning of repeated interactions, it typically decreases over time. If, however, people are given the opportunity to punish each other, cooperation can be stabilized as many cooperators are willing to punish free riders even at own material costs. The main aim of this study is to experimentally investigate the extent to which these insights from repeated public goods games with and without punishment translate into a context in which the benefits of cooperation are delayed into the future."
