abstract: "High crimes against women, in the form of sexual harassment (at home, workplace and public places), along with excessive under-reporting of these crimes lead to serious violation of human rights, vulnerability of girls and women and have its repercussion on female employment and overall wellbeing. Despite strict government laws in place and full-fledged departments dealing with such cases, such high incidence of crime against women necessitates making women self-dependent and equipping them with the required information regarding the various laws for women and teaching them about self-defense, which can help deter crimes against women to an extent.
