abstract: "With the advancement of AI technology, humans are beginning to converse with social AI-powered chatbots in their daily lives. Whether the interactions with the social AI-bot would replace social human connections is elusive. In this study, we would like to understand how different modes of interactions would affect human behavior and their attitudes. We also plan to investigate if the effect would vary across different situations. "
