abstract: "We partnered with the Rwandan governmental agency Energy Water Sanitation Authority (EWSA) in a study that pilots different dissemination strategies for the national cookstove program in Rwanda using a cluster randomized trial. The national cookstove program promotes improved cookstoves (ICS) that consume less firewood than traditional cookstoves. Drawing on a sample of households from treatment and control regions, we estimate the magnitude of the rebound effect, that is, the degree to which energy savings from an ICS are offset by an increase in demand for cooking services."
