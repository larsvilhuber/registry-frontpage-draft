abstract: " According to data from the United Nations Refugee Agency by 2021, more than 4.6 million Venezuelans had left their country and approximately 1.7 million were settled in Colombia—an equivalent shock of approximately 3 percent of Colombia’s total population. Colombia is currently the primary recipient of Venezuelan migrants fleeing from the Venezuelan humanitarian crisis. 

The Colombian government has maintained a generous policy towards Venezuelan migrants by granting them free mobility and access to labor markets. In 2018, the Colombian government gave approximately half a million irregular Venezuelan migrants in Colombia the opportunity to regularize their migratory situation in Colombia through the PEP-RAMV program. Interestingly, only roughly more than half of the eligible migrants applied for the regularization program. Ibáñez et al. (2020) document that migrant’s reasons for not registering include (i) lack of awareness about the program, (ii) lack of trust in the Colombian government explained by fears of deportation, and (iii) registration bottlenecks (or lack of information about how to apply). 

In 2021 the Colombian government announced that the migrant’s regularization program was going to be extended to any Venezuelan migrant who arrived in Colombia before February of 2021; the new migratory status is to be valid for 10 years and will grant migrants access to labor markets and social safety nets. Our research team is conducting a randomized control trial that evaluates the effectiveness of delivering information about the regularization program on the program’s take-up rates. Particularly, we will evaluate the effectiveness of information that aims to solve issues of information on the program’s (i) awareness, (ii) trust towards the government, and (iii) reducing registration bottlenecks.
