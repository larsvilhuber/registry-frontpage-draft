abstract: "In this study, we investigate the effect of leadership functions on team performance in non-routine, analytical team tasks. We use a field setup in which groups of teams work on a non-routine analytical team task to stimulate certain functions of leadership and compare it to situations in which these functions are not stressed. The task makes teams face complex and novel problems, it is analytical and cognitively demanding as teams need to collect and recombine information which requires to think outside the box to succeed, and it is interactive as team members have to collaborate, discuss possible actions, and develop ideas jointly with their team members."
