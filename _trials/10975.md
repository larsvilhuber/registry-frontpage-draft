abstract: "The present project is a follow-up to a randomized controlled trial investigating students’ misperceptions about their peers’ study time, and their impacts on students’ own schoolwork investments. The initial randomized controlled trial was pre-registered at the AEA RCT registry prior to data collection (AEARCTR-0005514). The present pre-analysis plan should be read as an addition to the former pre-analysis plan. The main goals of the second randomized controlled trial and of the additional data collection are (i) to strengthen the robustness of the initial findings, (ii) to investigate the mechanisms behind the main findings."
