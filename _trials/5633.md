abstract: "This study examines the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic and related policy orders on outcomes in three domains: (1) labor market outcomes, economic insecurity, and safety net utilization, (2) the risk avoidance response, and (3) mental health and substance use.  We rely on the Understanding America Study (UAS), a nationally-representative sample of of US adults.  We fielded a baseline survey of COVID-19 perceptions and avoidance behaviors in March 2020.  At the beginning of April we began a rolling panel survey of these outcomes that will continue as funding permits, at least through April.  Our studies rely on difference-in-difference and event study empirical strategies.
