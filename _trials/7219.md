abstract: "Experimental research in behavioral economics focuses on consumer behaviors. Similar research on profit-maximizing producers is rare. In three field experiments involving commercial agricultural producers in the US, we test whether anchoring affects producer bids in competitive auctions for conservation cost-share contracts worth thousands of dollars. In conservation cost-share contracts, the costs of implementing an on-farm conservation practice (an impure public good) are shared by the farmer and an external agent (e.g., government or non-profit). In the three field auctions in the study, the value of the starting cost-share bid was randomized to be either 0% or 100%.  We estimate the effect of the starting bid price on final bids and whether experience with conservation contracts attenuates the treatment effect."
