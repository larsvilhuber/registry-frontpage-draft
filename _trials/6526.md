abstract: "Much public management research uses data involving voluntary participation from public managers in surveys or interviews. To what extent may low-intensity text appeals promote public managers’ willingness to volunteer as respondents in research studies? Are particular types of text appeal more effective than others are? Using a between-subjects survey experimental design, this study examines the effects of various text appeals on public managers’ willingness to participate in a qualitative research interview. At the end of an electronic survey sent to about 10,000 public managers in Denmark, respondents are invited to participate in a follow-up interview study. Each respondent is randomly assigned to either a control group (basic text) or one of two treatment groups, TG1 or TG2. Respondents in TG1 are exposed to brief text serving “controlled extrinsic” forms of motivation, whereas respondents in TG2 are exposed to brief text appealing to prosocial forms of motivation. We examine and compare the effects of the treatments on the respondents’ survey-reported willingness to participate in the follow-up interview study."
