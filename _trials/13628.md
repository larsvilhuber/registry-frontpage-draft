abstract: "Over the last three decades, many developing countries have made tremendous progress in primary school enrollment. However, students in those countries exhibit very low learning outcomes. In Cote d’Ivoire, more than half the students at the end of primary school lack basic reading and mathematics skills. Solutions to address this learning crisis, such as remedial programs with targeted instructions, exist, but support to teachers beyond their initial training to these programs is often neglected. In particular, we lack knowledge about effective ways to support teachers during the implementation of these solutions. The present research project aims to test innovative ways that government-appointed mentors can support teachers when implementing the Teaching at the Right Level approach, one approach that Cote d’Ivoire has adopted to address its ongoing learning crisis. Informed by insights from our previous qualitative studies, we are testing a novel mentoring approach based on targeting schools for mentor in-person visits with data and on remote mentoring. "
