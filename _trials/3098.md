abstract: "Failure to appear for court dates for low-level offenses remains high, which results in legal consequences for defendants and costs for the criminal justice system. This randomized controlled trial evaluates the effects of several interventions to increase successful court date resolutions: postcard reminders, SMS reminders, and SMS reminders with an invitation to ask court staff questions. Reminders will include useful details such as case number and court location, as well as additional information about the court system, its rules, and amenities. The study sample includes all individuals in the Traffic Courts, Misdemeanor Courts or Municipal Violations Courts who had not already resolved their ticket two weeks ahead of their court date. The proposed analysis will evaluate the interventions and explore the groups for whom it was differentially helpful. In addition, the study design will allow us to understand whether human help in navigating the court system is helpful above and beyond the low-cost informational interventions."
