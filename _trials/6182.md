abstract: "
The aim of this study is to understand if crisis trigger discriminatory reactions towards migrants or individuals that form parts of an out-group. For this purpose, we will carry out a survey experiment in Colombia, a country with a recent large inflow of forced migrants from Venezuela. All respondents will be asked a set of questions to elicit prejudice towards immigrants and a set of questions about COVID-19. The order of the two sets of questions will be randomized such that half of respondents gets the COVID-19 module first and is therefore “primed” to think about the pandemic before answering the immigration module (treatment group). The rest of participants will answer the COVID-19 module last (control group). The survey experiment will be conducted online to a representative sample of the Colombian population.
