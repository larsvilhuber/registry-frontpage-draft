abstract: "Malnutrition is a pressing public health issue in Nigeria, particularly affecting children under five in hard-to-reach communities. The Gombe ANRiN project addresses this challenge through a comprehensive approach involving the delivery of a Basic Package of Nutrition Services (BPNS) and innovative mobile-nutrition units. These units aim to overcome geographical barriers and provide essential nutrition services, awareness, and education to underserved populations. The project employs a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) design to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. Communities in Gombe State are randomized into intervention and control arms, with data collected through structured questionnaires, anthropometric measurements, and qualitative interviews. Trained field enumerators administer surveys, while mobile units deliver services and collect data electronically using the Open Data Kit (ODK) tool."
