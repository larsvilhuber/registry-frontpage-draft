abstract: "We construct a simple model of preventive health behavior under present-biased time preferences, and show how beliefs about future time preferences (sophistication, partial naivete, and perfect naivete) affect how agents are predicted to use, under-use or misuse different types of commitment contracts. We propose a type of commitment contract that has the potential to benefit not just sophisticated present biased agents, but also naifs. We conduct a field experiment focused on increasing the share of patients who actively manage their hypertension by visiting a doctor periodically. The experiment is closely tied to the theory, allowing us to estimate key parameters of the model."
