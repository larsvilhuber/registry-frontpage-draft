abstract: "In our previous experiment (Chen and Guan, 2021), we find a significant detrimental effect of auditory descriptions on economic rationality relative to visual descriptions. This disparity may stem from the tendency of individuals to process auditory information sequentially, as opposed to the simultaneous processing of visual information. In this follow-up experiment, we investigate this potential underlying mechanism by prompting subjects to process auditory and visual information sequentially in a tightly controlled setting. By comparing the economic rationality of the two new treatments, we aim to determine the driving mechanism affecting economic rationality when information is presented either visually or auditorily. If the experiment finds no significant differences between the Visual and Auditory Treatments, it would suggest that the sequential processing of information is the primary factor that leads to lower economic rationality when dealing with auditory descriptions. This would imply that the way information is presented (sequentially or simultaneously) is more critical than the descriptions (audio or visual). Conversely, if the disparity between the two treatments persists, it would suggest that individuals may have a comparatively lower cognitive ability to process auditory information effectively. This would indicate that the description itself plays a significant role, with auditory processing potentially being less conducive to economic rationality than visual processing."
