abstract: "I study the effects of neighborhoods on inequality perceptions and demand for redistribution in the context of Barcelona. To that end, I combine rich administrative data with original survey data. The main approach to identification exploits the rise of new apartment buildings as a quasi-experiment, but the survey also contains two cross-randomized information experiments as alternative identification approaches. The first experiment gives respondents information about the level of inequality in Barcelona and is expected to influence perceived national-level inequality. The second experiment provides information about the respondent's position in the national income distribution and is expected to influence demand for redistribution. The main focus of the project is on perceived inequality, but the survey also elicits other kinds of perceptions related to the demand for redistribution (e.g., immigration, social mobility) that I plan to explore in different spin-off projects.
