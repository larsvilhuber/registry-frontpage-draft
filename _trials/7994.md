abstract: "Existing observational evidence and a nascent experimental literature suggest that women’s childcare responsibilities contribute to gender inequality in low-income countries and dampen economic growth. We contribute to this literature by conducting the first field experiment of rural childcare provision. We randomly select pairwise-matched villages in the Kongo Central province of the DRC to receive community-based childcare services for 12-14 months. Two follow-up surveys will be conducted to estimate impacts on women’s and households’ time-use, economic engagement, welfare outcomes and children’s development. "
