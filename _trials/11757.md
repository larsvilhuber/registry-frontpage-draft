abstract: "The impact of infrastructure development is difficult to measure because of its innate nature of non-randomness. We examine the impact of smallholder irrigation scheme by assigning farmer groups randomly to make a causal inference on livelihood of smallholder farmers. Moreover, a half of farmer groups which are randomized assigned among the treatment group receive market-oriented agricultural extension too. This study reveals the relative impact of infrastructure (hardware) and agricultural extension (software). This study stands out as an exceptionally rare evaluation of an infrastructure project based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). As far as we know, it's also the pioneering RCT conducted for an irrigation project."
