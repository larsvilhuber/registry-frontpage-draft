abstract: "Alaska's Permanent Fund Dividend Program is akin to a Universal Cash-Transfer program, paying (virtually) every Alaskan resident $2,000 per year. Yet, little is known about whether this program influences people's migration decisions. Whereas existing literature suggests people do move for financial gain (e.g., to receive a tax cut), cash transfers may create alternative behavioral responses. Herein we survey roughly 4000 people on Prolific to gauge their preference for - and stated willingness to move for -  equivalently-sized cash transfers and tax cuts. Conventional economic theory suggests people should view tax cuts and cash transfers similarly. However, we hypothesize that loss aversion, employment status, income, parenthood and political ideology may all cause people to view such programs differently. Any documented lack of fungibility will be explored using  the observed heterogeneity of the subject pool."
