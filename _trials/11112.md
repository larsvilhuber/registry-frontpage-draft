abstract: "The Sahel Women Empowerment and Demographic Dividend (SWEDD) Project was designed to empower girls and women to accelerate the demographic transition and build human capital in and around the Sahel, where most adolescent girls are at risk of child marriage, teenage pregnancy, and early school drop-out. As part of its second phase in Mauritania, a holistic school and community-based intervention to remove taboos, barriers, and constraints faced by adolescent girls in Mauritania to adequately manage their periods and improve their menstrual hygiene management (MHM) will be implemented, contributing to the project goal of improving girls’ schooling outcomes and addressing the objective to keep girls in school through at least secondary. 

This intervention will take advantage of the existing activities implemented in the Safe Spaces (SS) already in place through the SWEDD project, such as the training on basic MHM knowledge and practices and other sexual and reproductive health skills and life skills delivered through the SS curriculum, and the provision of hygiene kits. On top of that, based on formative research, a social and behavioral change, and communication (SBCC) intervention, targeted at adolescent girls, their parents, and other key community members, and designed to address the barriers and needs around MHM, will be put in place. The holistic school and community-based intervention will be implemented by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs and Education and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Promotion of Productive Sectors of Mauritania, with the technical assistance of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the World Bank (WB). 

Using a randomized controlled trial, with randomization at the school level, this study will test the impact of a holistic MHM approach, in which adolescent girls, their parents, and other key community members will be engaged through an SBCC intervention, and in which hygiene kits will be provided, on girls’ education, health, socio-emotional well-being, psycho-emotional skills and social and mobility restrictions. The study will assess whether this approach has the potential to be more effective than the basic MHM training provided in the SS. The results from this evaluation will inform the SWEDD activities on MHM not only in Mauritania but also in the other SWEDD countries.
