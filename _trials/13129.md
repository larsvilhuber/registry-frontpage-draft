abstract: "This study concerns the influence of information provision in boosting climate change adaptation behaviors. Specifically, we conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment among cocoa farmers in Ghana to compare the impact of different types and combinations of information regarding the benefits of shade trees on farmers’ shade management adoption decisions. We compare farmers’ responses to information on private benefits of shade trees with those to information emphasizing the social benefits; we explore whether providing social benefits in addition to private benefits can help or hurt tree planting based on farmers’ degree of altruism, intention of social signaling and free-riding incentives; we also ask whether providing private benefits on top of social benefits is valuable; lastly, we test whether cocoa farmers are more responsive when information includes both positive and downside aspects of growing shade trees, as opposed to cases where only the benefits of tree planting are highlighted. Our primary outcomes are farmers’ choice of the number of shade trees to grow on hypothetical lands in the game and sign-up decisions for free tree seedlings in the real Green Ghana Program."
