abstract: "Only half of Pakistani children receive all their basic vaccinations by their second birthday. Due to this lack of vaccination coverage, Pakistan is one of only three countries in the world where polio is still endemic, and other preventable diseases are still rampant. Improving and expanding routine immunization coverage can significantly reduce children malnutrition, morbidity and mortality. Moreover, by preventing illnesses, immunizations can improve a child's cognitive skills and performance at school, which can lead to increased productivity in the long term. We propose to design and implement interventions with mothers of young infants to increase the uptake of basic vaccinations by (1) alleviating maternal mental stress, and/or (2) improving knowledge about the costs, risks, and benefits of immunization. We further hypothesize that mothers may be preoccupied with other short-term concerns, and so the information interventions by themselves may have little impact even when individuals are misinformed. To investigate this, we propose to provide a brief psychological first aid (PFA) to some mothers, and a PFA combined with relevant information about vaccines to other mothers."
