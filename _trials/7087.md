abstract: "In this study we evaluate communication-based interventions to decrease doctorsâ€™ hesitancy in prescribing the HPV vaccine to adolescent girls. In a field survey experiment, we expose medical practitioners -- general physicians, pediatricians and gynaecologists --  to a video based stimulus and collect information on attitudes, intentions, before and after the intervention. We test for 5 different interventions -- endorsement from trusted medical experts, providing conversational tips, combining HPV vaccine prescription with other widely accepted medical prescriptions, poster-based nudges, and increasing salience of risk from HPV. We conduct our survey experiment with a sample of medical practitioners in West Bengal using self-administered computer assisted personal interviews."
