abstract: "In this study we aim to identify the effect of social influence interventions in motivating volunteering behavior, in the setting of blood donations. We develop a novel experimental design to disentangle social pressure from social recognition motives. We vary other aspects of the social influence intervention (communication channel and social proximity of peers) to inform theory as well as practical implementation challenges of behavioral interventions that are implemented at a large scale."
