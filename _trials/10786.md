abstract: "The Ultra Poor Graduation approach is designed to graduate households out of extreme poverty to a more stable state. The BOMA Project has adapted the graduation approach for the arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs) of Africa with their Rural Entrepreneur Access Project (REAP). In 2019 BOMA created “Green” REAP as a way for communities to minimize the negative environmental impact of business activities, spur positive engagement with the environment, adapt to the climate crisis and mitigate the impact of climate change on the community. Green REAP aims to simultaneously move households out of extreme poverty and create positive environmental impacts. Its three main pillars are greening livelihoods (using green enterprises to graduate the ultra-poor out of poverty), greening systems (advocating for policy and structural changes to create an enabling environment for sustainable resource management and climate-neutral micro, small, and medium enterprises) and greening values (changing social norms, attitudes, and practices regarding natural resource management). 

We are conducting a multi-arm clustered randomized evaluation of Green REAP with three arms; Standard REAP, Green REAP and control. The evaluation will establish whether: Green REAP is able to maintain (or increase) the poverty and welfare impacts of Standard REAP while achieving additional environmental benefits. Participation in Green REAP encourages households to: engage in environmentally friendly businesses such as beekeeping or gum and resin harvesting; reduce household dependence on charcoal production; improve livestock grazing practices; and fortify community resource management groups. 

The evaluation will be randomized at the community level. It will measure community-level outcomes (such as the intensity of observed activities in the forest) as well as individual household outcomes (such as income, food security, environmental attitudes, forest extraction activities, and participation in green value chains and community forest associations).
