abstract: "Affective polarization describes the phenomenon that the disagreement between people from different parties have spread from the ideological realm to other aspects of life. How to distinguish between preferences and beliefs remains an open question in the research of affective polarization. People's identification with a group is affected by group salience and group status. This study is based on Joe Biden's inauguration, which is expected to increase group salience for both Democrats and Republicans, and is expected to increase the social status of Democrats, while decreasing that of Republicans. We plan to run an experiment on CloudResearch. By comparing of people's behaviors before and after the inauguration, we hope to decompose people's political identity into preferences and beliefs, and explore whether the inauguration leads to more affective polarization of Democrats and Republicans."
