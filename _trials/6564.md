abstract: "While fake news spreading misinformation about COVID-19 is a global concern, it is a particular pervasive problem in India. In this paper, we study how to debunk fake news and combat misinformation in slums of India. While studies found that communication technologies and social media can be effective communication tools, we know little about what role the identity of the messenger plays. Our first research question adds to this knowledge gap, by providing evidence on: How effective are doctorsâ€™ messages to counter misinformation about ways to prevent COVID-19? Accompanying the pandemic, we also experienced globally riots and protests linked to discrimination events. Given religious tensions in India, we also address the question: How does religion identity moderate the processing of new information? We will do so making use of technologies of information through mobile phones. Yet, uptake of messages via phone technologies can be extremely low and hence, the effectiveness of these tools can be limited. Thus, we also study: Can higher financial rewards lead to higher uptake of messages? We will conduct a field experiment to study these research questions in the context of slums in Lucknow and Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. We rely on a recently collected census data of more than 30,000 households, and we will collect baseline and follow-up surveys through mobile phones for almost 4,000 randomly sampled households. "
