abstract: "The internet greatly facilitates sharing of course work in college. Students can send screen shots of their answers, copy homework and share files they turn in. However this behavior is counterproductive to learning skills required for productivity in the workforce. Using an online excel module, students learn required skills necessary for work in accounting, finance, management and computer science. We have the ability to detect when students share files using this module.  The course syllabus has a clear statement regarding cheating, but previous semesters suggest that 10 percent of students cheat on assignments by sharing all or part of their Excel files. To lessen cheating we propose to send a series of nudges to two randomized groups. We will test how nudging students via email effects subsequent cheating episodes and how sanctions will play a role in these episodes."
