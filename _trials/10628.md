abstract: "This study will survey property owners in the city of Quelimane, Mozambique. It will vary the information provided to survey respondents in a 2x2 matrix. 25% will hear a message about public good provision in the city in recent years; 25% will hear a message about how municipal tax receipts increase the fiscal and political autonomy of the municipality; 25% will hear both messages; and 25% will hear neither. Respondents will then be given the opportunity to participate in a public goods game mimicking tax payment, to send a text message requesting information and/or a visit from tax collectors, to vote in a simulated ballot box, and to provide survey measures of tax morale, civic and political attitudes."
