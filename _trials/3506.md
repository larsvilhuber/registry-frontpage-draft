abstract: "Social protection interventions in the Sahel have overwhelmingly consisted of emergency responses to rising international food and fuel prices or to droughts and other climate shocks. To meet long-term poverty reduction goals, governments are shifting towards a broader safety net approach to protect the chronically poor and invest in their human capital. In Mauritania, a nation-wide social cash transfer program (Tekavoul) is being rolled-out with the goal of reaching 100,000 extremely poor households by 2020. Beneficiaries receive 15,000 Ouguiyas (US$ 50) every three months for a period of five years, conditional on participation in social promotion activities addressing hygiene, nutrition, education, civil registration, and child development. 

The impact evaluation aims to measure the impact of Tekavoul, with and without the social promotion activities. Despite the emerging consensus among development policy-makers on the effectiveness of cash transfers in improving living conditions of extremely poor households, rigorous evidence in the Sahel region remains scarce. More information is also needed to understand what works to bring about behavioral change and human capital investments. In addition to economic outcomes, the present study will also measure the impact of unconditional cash transfers and an information campaign on hygiene, nutrition, and early childhood development outcomes. A separate, multi-country, evaluation is testing different variations of a productive measures package offered to a subset of Tekavoul beneficiaries. Together, the two studies are designed to fill critical knowledge gaps on productive safety nets and women’s empowerment not only in Mauritania, but also in the broader Sahel region."
