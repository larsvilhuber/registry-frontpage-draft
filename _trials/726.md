abstract: "Background: 
We evaluate whether health education integrated into microcredit lending groups reduces health risks by improving health knowledge and behaviors among urban and rural borrowers in eastern Benin. 

Methods:
In 2007, we randomly assigned 138 villages in the Plateau region of Benin to one of four variations of a group liability credit product, varying lending groups’ gender-composition and/or inclusion of health education using a 2x2 design. Groups 1 (female-only) and 2 (mixed-gender) included health education on malaria, childhood illness danger signs, and HIV/AIDS. Groups 3 (female-only) and 4 (mixed-gender) received the credit product without health education. In 2010, a follow-up survey in 121 of 138 villages (n=3,625) interviewed a random sample of women living near each village meeting site to measure respondents’ knowledge of malaria, childhood illness, and HIV/AIDS; prevention and treatment behaviors; and empowerment and social capital. We estimate treatment effects on indices of key outcome variables using ordinary least squares.

Findings:
Women in villages receiving health education showed improved knowledge of malaria and of HIV/AIDS, but not of childhood illness danger signs. No significant changes in health behavior were observed except an increase in HIV/AIDS prevention behavior, a result predominantly driven by an increase in respondents’ self-reported ability to procure a condom, likely an indicator of increased perceived access rather than improved preventative behavior. Women in villages assigned to mixed-gender groups had significantly lower levels of social capital, compared to villages assigned to female-only groups.

Interpretation:
Bundling health education with microcredit may not be an effective way to improve health behavior.
