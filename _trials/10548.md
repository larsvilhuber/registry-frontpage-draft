abstract: "In a randomized controlled study, we will investigate potential barriers in the application process for health insurance subsidies. For this purpose, all eligible individuals are randomly divided into seven groups. In each treatment group, a barrier in the application process will be addressed and reduced. In the control group, the same procedure as before is implemented. The aim of this study is to understand which measures are most effective in reducing the barrier to take-up of health insurance subsidies and the downstream consequences of these measures. "
