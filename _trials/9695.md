abstract: "This study investigates the effect of in-person versus remote work on worker voice and behavior. The pandemic has not only changed how we work, but also where we work from. Despite offices reopening across the globe, over 60% of workers choose to continue working from home. Remote work has changed the way in which workers interact, with face-to-face communication and water cooler talk being replaced entirely by virtual meetings and team chat groups. Given these circumstances, it is imperative to understand how worker voice might be affected by a general shift to remote work."
