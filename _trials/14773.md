abstract: "Existing literature shows that pre-paid metering can reduce electricity consumption by increasing the salience of marginal prices and therefore be welfare improving (Jack & Smith, 2020). Pre-paid metering is also the default charging method for electricity consumption in many developing areas including our study area, which may contribute to their low electric heating consumption in winter. This project builds on the understanding of the impacts of pre-paid metering by considering the design of subsidies when governments wish to increase electric heating consumption, for example, to increase access to homes heated to health standards. In this study, we plan to implement a field experiment linked to administrative data to explore whether low electric heating demand is due to credit constraints, income constraints, or simply a lack of knowledge and experience of electric heating and its health benefits."
