abstract: "We assess the impact of a social information program on the disposal of unsorted waste. We study a program implemented by an Italian multi-utility using an hybrid Pay-as-you-Throw collection system.  Households are assigned a maximum number of solid waste units yearly and pay a fixed amount when the quantities are below such limit. For each unit exceeding the cap, customers pay per unit. We randomize customers into a treatment group which receives quarterly reports including information over the volume of unsorted waste compared to the average waste of similar customers living in the city, and a control group which receives nothing. Within the group of treated households receiving the report, half receives the standard report. The other half receives the report along with a clear reference to the disposal cap.  This information allows treated customers to keep track of their performance against the cap, which is calculated on a yearly basis. We measure the main and heterogeneous treatment effects on the volume of unsorted waste and on the probability of passing the yearly threshold. "
