abstract: "How does scientific news about natural and social dimensions of climate science affect support for climate policy in the general population? We study this fundamental question with a large-scale survey experiment that exposes 8000 members from the general population in Germany to good and bad news about climate science, next to control treatments that contain no information or information but no good or bad news. Specifically, we consider news on the magnitude of equilibrium climate sensitivity, on the effectiveness of climate policy instruments, and on the plausibility of reaching the Paris temperature targets. We also examine the emotions evoked by different kinds of news and the effect of those emotions on support for climate policy."
