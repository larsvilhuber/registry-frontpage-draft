abstract: "The SPIR project supports delivery of the Fourth Phase of the Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP4) in Ethiopiaâ€™s Amhara and Oromia Regions while also delivering multisectoral programming to enhance livelihoods, increase resilience to shocks, improve food security and nutrition and strengthen gender equality for PSNP4 beneficiaries. The impact evaluation uses a clustered randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with four intervention arms (three treatments and a control group) to compare alternative graduation model program strategies to improve livelihoods, food security and nutrition of PSNP4 beneficiaries.
