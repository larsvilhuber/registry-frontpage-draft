abstract: "The Buurzorg healthcare organisation, created by Jos de Blok in 2006 with a dozen professionals, currently includes 10.000 employees. This success encouraged the adoption of this organisational model by other organizations, in France and around the world. By giving employees more autonomy to organize their schedule and the care plan of the patient, this model of self-managed teams is supposed to empower employees. The employees would be more motivated and satisfied, and the quality of their work would be improved for the beneficiaries.

In France, the long-term care sector is growing and suffering: the working conditions are difficult while wages and career prospects are low. The implementation of the "autonomous teams" model, inspired by Buurtzorg's principles, seems a promising avenue to limit job dissatisfaction and turnover, but the management of schedules and care plans implies developing new skills, and a high level of investment at work. A careful impact evaluation would ensure that this organisational model indeed improves workers satisfaction and the care received by beneficiaries. 

This project aims at evaluating the effects of the new working organisation called autonomous teams on the employees (absenteeism, turnover, psychosocial risks, job satisfaction) and on the beneficiaries (hospitalizations, deaths, medication, nursing home entry). It aims at informing public policies from the public health and the health at work standpoints.

To ensure that long-term care organisations, teams and employees that undergo the change in organisations are comparable to those that do not, we implement a randomized controlled trial. This means randomly choosing, among the teams of employees that are willing to adopt the new model, the ones that will actually change their work organisation. The causal impact of the program will be measured by comparing the treated and control employees and care beneficiaries."
