abstract: "This randomized control trial evaluates the impact of psychometric matching on student outcomes and student satisfaction. All students and tutors in the study are evaluated based on a psychometric assessment known as HEXACO. From there, half of the students are matched to tutors based on an algorithm which evaluates the HEXACO traits of the student and the tutor and half of the students are matched randomly. Student self-reported session ratings of tutors is used as a measure of satisfaction and student SAT score improvement is used as a measure of change in outcomes. This trial takes place in an online school environment in the context of 1-1 synchronous learning via video call. Randomization occurs through a random number generator function which assigns people below a certain cut-off value (0.5) to one trial and those at or above the cut-off value to the other trial. Blinding occurs as students and tutors do not know if they are matched through psychometrics or not. Additional blinding occurs as the data analysis of results will be conducted blind as well. "
