abstract: "This document provides a pre-analysis plan for a health intervention in the Northern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Our study is interested in better understanding how variation in age sets practices -- initiation rituals for young men -- affect the accountability of local leaders. Anthropologists hypothesized that age sets increase accountability of leaders by creating cohesive groups of young men. We test this with an intervention providing village chiefs with grants to purchase health products, which are provided at subsidized rates and delivered to the village. As part of the project, village oversight committees are formed to monitor the chief's management of the project and its resources. The primary experimental manipulation is varying the composition of the oversight committees; half are composed of a random selection of volunteers and the other half over-represent young men. We examine how the committee composition affects chief performance and how this effect differs depending on whether age sets are present."
