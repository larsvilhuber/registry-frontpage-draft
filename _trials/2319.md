abstract: "In this collaboration between the Greater Chesapeake & Potomac Region Blood Service Unit of the American Red Cross and researchers at Johns Hopkins University, we propose to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to improve our understanding of the causes of the low African American participation in blood donation, and to offer insights on how to increase it. We plan to test the effects of (a) information about the specific need for blood among African Americans (e.g., due to sickle cell disease), and (b) how the blood will be used in the local community. We will also evaluate the potential effect of personal testimonies of patients with sickle cell disease. We propose to deliver targeted messages to a set of blood drive sponsors in the Greater Chesapeake & Potomac Region. We will collect data on donors presenting and blood collected at subsequent blood drives at those sponsors, and compare them to outcomes at those sites in the past and at other sites in the region. Only drive-level aggregate outcomes will be recorded (no individual-level information or outcomes will be collected).
