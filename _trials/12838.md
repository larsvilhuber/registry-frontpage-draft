abstract: "Performance evaluations are a primary determinant of hiring and promotion decisions, and peer evaluations have become increasingly widespread in the workplace. Identifying bias in these evaluations is essential but challenging primarily for two reasons: sorting of evaluators and candidates and lack of an objective performance measure to serve as a benchmark. We overcome these challenges in peer performance evaluations setting in a large, introductory course at a flagship public university. Peer evaluators were randomly assigned to score essays using a rubric producing two subscores: content and writing. Evaluators were incentivized to match official grades using the same rubric, adding a monitoring effect. We exploit the random assignments of both peer evaluators and blinded official graders over several essay assignments. With this, we are able to analyze whether students with female-sounding names receive lower scores compared to students without female-sounding names in content and/or writing subscores. We also test whether gender bias show any variation when students are evaluated by female/male peer. "
