abstract: "This study aims to increase retention and job satisfaction of female workers (kindergarten teachers) in Karnataka, India, by engaging the family members who influence their employment decisions. The interventions involve (a) showing videos with testimonials about how working has raised women's self-esteem and has not caused social stigma or compromised personal safety and (b) spurring discussions between the teacher and her family members about the pros and cons of her working."
