abstract: "We conduct an experiment to study individual repeated risk-taking behavior, both under pre-commitment and sequentially. In particular, we elicit each subjectâ€™s unconstrained risk-taking strategy, that is, the completely contingent plan of taking a risk several times. In addition to time- and outcome-dependent risk-taking, we allow a subset of the subjects to make risk-taking path-dependent or conditional on an exogenous randomization device."
