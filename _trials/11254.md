abstract: "This study will explore the effectiveness of delivering climate change education in schools, using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Bangladesh. The primary objective is to examine the impact of two information interventions on students' and teachers' climate change knowledge, attitudes, and willingness to take action against climate change. Another goal is to investigate whether enhanced climate change awareness leads to greater interest in and pursuit of STEM fields. "
