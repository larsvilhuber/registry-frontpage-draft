abstract: "We use a field experiment to investigate the demand for agency within and outside the household.  We pair individuals either with their spouses or a stranger and ask them to make donation decisions from an individual and a joint budget.  Then they ask them whether they accept that to delegate the decision to the partner or would prefer to pay to regain the decision rights and implement their preferred donation.  The experimental conditions allow disentangling whether the demand for the agency is related to a preference for non-interference, preference for freedom, or demand for power.   The experiment takes place in rural areas of Antioquia, Colombia.  To understand the role of female (dis)empowerment on the values of decision rights we use exogenous variation in mining activities as predicted by metal deposits. 
This experiment contributes to understanding the drivers of gender differences in the intrinsic value of the demand for agency.
