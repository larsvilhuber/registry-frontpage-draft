abstract: "The experiment investigates the causal effect of social distancing on behavioral traits that are important in interpersonal relationships. We exploit the different timing of stay-at-home orders issued during the COVID-19 outbreak as a natural experiment that provides an exogenous manipulation of social distancing.  
The study analyses how social distancing affects trust, trustworthiness, and solidarity using incentivized tasks within a sample of Prolific participants. Given the huge uncertainty induced by the pandemic, we also elicit the individual level of risk aversion, both as a dependent variable and as a control for the (change in the) interpersonal behavioral traits.
We implement an incentivized longitudinal online study in two States (X and Y) in the US. The first wave has been administered on the same day the stay-at-home order took effect in State X, while in State Y the policy had already been introduced about two weeks earlier, thereby having the time to display its effects on agentsâ€™ behavior. The second wave will take place after two weeks. 
In addition to the natural experiment, our design also entails a RCT in order to disentangle in-group vs out-group effects of social distancing on trust and trustworthiness. We randomly assign subjects to the in-group (subjects from the same city) and the out-group treatment (subjects from another State in the US). 
Given that the stay-at-home policy will still be effective in both States at the time of wave 2, the design allows us to identify the effects of the increased social distancing using a Difference-in-Difference (DID) approach, allowing to get rid of time-constant observable and unobservable heterogeneity.
