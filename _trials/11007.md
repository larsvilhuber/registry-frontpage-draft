abstract: "This project examines the short- and medium-term effects of a literacy program for kindergarten-age children in Denmark, called Læseklar (meaning reading-ready in Danish). Læseklar is a multi-sensory tutoring program that targets the students most at risk of reading difficulties. The program combines components that have shown promising results in the international literature: one-to-one and small-group tutoring, a focus on phonemic awareness, phonics, decoding, and multi-sensory learning methods.

We evaluate the effectiveness of the program with a cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT). Approximately 80 schools will participate in the experiment, half will receive the treatment and the other half is the control group. The short-term primary outcome measure is a standardized test of decoding. Secondary outcomes are subscales from the Danish national survey of well-being. Both outcomes are measured at the end of kindergarten. The medium-term primary outcome is the Danish national test in reading conducted in the first semester of grade 2. Secondary outcomes are subscales from the second grade version of the well-being survey. All outcomes are measured for all students in participating classes in treatment and control schools, which enables us to examine peer effects of the intervention for each outcome."
