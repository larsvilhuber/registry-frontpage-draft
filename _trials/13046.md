abstract: "Despite rapid economic growth since 1990’s, declining fertility, and an increase in education of women in India over the past three decades, the workforce participation rate for women aged 25-60 in the country continues to remain low at 27%. One aspect that remains underexplored is the role of skills in explaining the persistent low female LFP in India. In 2020, around 15% women and 28% men aged 18-45 had undergone formal or informal vocational training. In addition, digital skills remain lower for women. For instance, internet usage among Indian women remains significantly below that of women in lower-middle income regions. These skills have the potential to benefit women by improving the job search process, allowing them to work remotely or in flexible jobs through participation in the gig economy, and starting their own businesses online. Low awareness about digital technology and related skills which are important in the recent world to gain access to job opportunities in the labor market can constrain women’s employment. To address the low skill acquisition by women in India and to exploit complementarities that acquiring digital skills might bring, we design an intervention in two cities, namely Delhi and Bangalore, to analyse the role of both hard skills and a combination of hard skills with digital and communication skills in enhancing women's employment."
