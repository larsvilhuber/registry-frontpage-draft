abstract: "The aim of this study is to explain why microcredit programs work to different extents  even when socioeconomic contexts are controlled for. We plan to estimate the causal impact of an official microcredit project – the village fund in rural China – on a number of economic well-being outcomes, and identify the reasons explaining the impact heterogeneity from perspectives of local political cycles.
