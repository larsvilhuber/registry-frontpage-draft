abstract: "This project is a Randomized Controlled Trial designed to measure the impact of alternative pricing models on access to improved sanitation services in peri-urban West Africa.

The market for improved sanitation services (mechanized desludging in particular) is important:  sanitation services have high externalities for the local communities. A government may want to intervene in the market for sanitation services but find it difficult to do so as they are unable to observe values for the consumers or costs for the service providers.  

In a first round survey, we measured the underlying values of services for customers and the cost of providing services for desludging operators.  We used this information to design two pricing treatment structures, one with fixed prices set based on household characteristics, and another with desludger bidding and negotiations with desludgers for lower prices.  The fixed prices are set based on household characteristics; this treatment is designed to allow governments to target subsidies to poor households while financing some of the subsidies through price discrimination toward wealthier households. We will test whether these pricing structures, developed based on the underlying factors in the economy, perform better than the control group which has no pricing intervention in terms of total take-up of mechanized desludging.  This project will describe and test how information on market structure can be used to help in designing interventions by governments to improve the market structure of sanitation services."
