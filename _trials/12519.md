abstract: "We study the effects of a new program for integrating unemployed immigrants into the labor market. A key part of this program is to create strong financial incentives for private service providers to place immigrants into gainful employment. Participation is randomized and service providers are compensated for the cost-savings to the public sector (measured by income taxes and unemployment benefits) relative to a control group participating in business-as-usual services. The new program provides a fast track to on-the-job training, while the business-as-usual services emphasize in-class language training. Thus, there is a potential trade-off between being employed in the short-run and accumulating general skills that can be beneficial in the long-run. We use the randomization and administrative data on participants' labor market outcomes, training participation and language skills to measure the effectiveness of the program both in the short- and long-run."
