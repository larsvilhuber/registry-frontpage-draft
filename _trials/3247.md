abstract: "We will conduct a survey-based choice experiment to estimate discount rates and the publicâ€™s willingness to pay (WTP) for groundwater management in the MRVA in Arkansas.  We will also estimate marginal WTP for groundwater services (certainty of irrigation supply known as buffer value, groundwater quality, jobs in agriculture, wildlife habitat, and avoidance of subsidence) and for two distinct management policies (surface water infrastructure and a cap and trade program for groundwater trading) relative to the status quo of subsidies for best management practices.  Individual respondents (n=2,000) will be randomly assigned to one of ten treatment conditions that vary in terms of the policy payment mechanism (lump sum or annual perpetually), the presence of a one-year delay before payments take effect, the presence of an individualist policy narrative text, and the presence of a textual reference to a recent California groundwater policy that was implemented."
