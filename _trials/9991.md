abstract: "Children in low-income countries often learn little from attending school (World Bank, 2018). The economics literature on how to improve education in developing countries is extensive but typically focuses on the school as an arena of learning (Glewwe and Muralidharan, 2016). So far, less attention has been paid to the role of parents. When school quality is low, the importance of the home as an arena for learning grows (Nye et al, 2006; Epstein, 1987; Niklas et al., 2021). While most parents care about their children’s education, they may not be able to provide sufficient support due to a lack of ability or motivation, a heavy discounting of the future, or a lack of information on either the educational production function or the returns to parental investment. Interventions seeking to stimulate parental engagement may thus be justified. 
One way to stimulate such engagement is to actively link parents to schools, through parental involvement programs. Barrera-Osorio et al. (2020) report from two field experiments in Mexico working through parent associations. They find that providing information to parents about ways to become involved in school activities was effective in increasing parents’ involvement with their children’s education at home, although this did not have any effect on the students’ test scores.
In this project, we analyze an intervention that more directly seeks to stimulate home learning, targeting families with primary school children (aged around 8-10) in Uganda. We evaluate it using a randomized controlled trial where families in the treatment arm are offered some learning material (exercise books).   
The learning intervention consists of exercise books in language (literacy and English) and mathematics as well as a short week-by-week progress plan, which specifies the relevant chapter for each week of the school term. Both the exercise books and the plan cover the duration of one school term (around 3 months). The content of the teaching material and the progress plan will harmonize with the regular content and plan at school. Hence, the teaching material will be selected by local experts from what already exists in the market, but which families typically cannot afford. The intervention, therefore, provides a valuable add-on to the regular teaching material, and an opportunity for the parents (and other family members) to get involved in the learning process.
