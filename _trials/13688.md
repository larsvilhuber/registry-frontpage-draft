abstract: "Ensuring a disease-free environment is a key challenge in shrimp farming, which has consequences on the levels of shrimp production. For an export-oriented product like Bagda, this may subsequently have an impact on the levels of exports. In this study, we study whether different levels of monetary incentive in the form of a discount voucher can reshape farmers' behavior regarding the adoption of a disease-free (Specific Pathogen Free--SPF PL) shrimp post-larvae (PL). We also test whether it can influence the experience of shrimp mortality and disease-related monetary losses, overall mortality rate, total shrimp harvest, and farmers' food security situation. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we will distribute discount vouchers among shrimp farmers in southern Bangladesh. We use an open lottery for each farmer to be included in each treatment group. 

Each farmer in the sample will receive a voucher for a range of discounts on one of two types of SPF-PL (Type A: sells at BDT 800 per 1,000 PL; Type B: sells at BDT 1,200 per 1,000 PL). Table 2 demonstrates the probable number of farmers by treatment group status. Treatment group 1 will receive a discount of BDT 100 for the type-A SPF-PL, while treatment group 2 will receive a discount of BDT 50 for the type-A SPF-PL. Treatment group 3, 4, 5 will receive a discount of BDT 500, BDT 400 and BDT 200, respectively, for the type-B SPF-PL. 

A farmer will be allowed to redeem their voucher for a MAXIMUM of 16,000 units of SPF-PL following the suggestions provided by the DoF for an acre of pond. Each voucher can be redeemed only once. If the treated farmers want to buy more than 16 thousand SPF-PL, they will have to buy the rest of the SPF-PL beyond 16 thousand at the regular market price. Those who will not receive any discount voucher (group 6) will be the control group. All the farmers will be provided with the same level of information on the technology and its source. The randomization is done at the individual level using a lottery for each individual farmer. The study will generate research and policy evidence on subsidy and technology adoption in agriculture and aquaculture space."
