abstract: "Smallholder farmers in India are increasingly exposed to climate change and extreme weather events. Timely and customized agricultural advice for specific crops grown by a farmer can improve management practices, productivity and profitability. However available services today do not incorporate potentially useful information on what farmers observe themselves, for instance crop color, texture and how the crop is growing over time. These features can potentially make advisories and loss monitoring more effective by providing information on crop growth stage, pests and diseases, and visible damage to the crops grown. We test the effectiveness of an extension model that provides personalized agro-advisory based on localized information and visible crop characteristics derived from a stream of farmersâ€™ own smartphone pictures for wheat crop in Haryana and Punjab regions of India. Pictures will be collected from farmers on a periodic basis through a freely available, easy-to-use mobile application. A first treatment arm will test the effects of this picture-based advisory model. A second treatment arm will test the added impact of providing a novel crop insurance that uses the stream of pictures to estimate plot-level crop loss in a cost-effective manner. We hypothesize that real-time crop data obtained from smartphone pictures can strengthen agricultural advisory and reduce basis risk in crop insurance. We will measure impact on take-up, productivity and profitability."
