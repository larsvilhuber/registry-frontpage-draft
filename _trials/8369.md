abstract: "In this online lab-experiment, we study the diffusion of rumors (uncertain information with no clear information on its source) in a social network. 
During the experiment, groups of 5 agents are structured in a line network. Some agents (4 out of 5 or 3 out of 5, depending on the treatment) are computerized agents, programmed to behave optimally. The other agents are real participants. 
One of the agents in the network receives a signal after a coin flip (Heads or Tails). Heads happens with a probability 0.3, while Tails happens with probability 0.7. This agent can create a message ("The outcome of the coin flip is Heads" or "The outcome of the coin flip is Tails") and transfer it to his direct neighbor(s). The message may then be diffused through the network. More precisely, each agent receiving the message may decide to transfer or block the message. At the end of the period, the group votes for a specific outcome (the outcome implemented by the group depends on a probability function).
There are two types of agents: biased and unbiased agents, with different payoff functions. Biased agents earn points only if the members of the network have implemented thanks to their votes the outcome "Heads", whatever the true outcome of the coin flip. Unbiased agents earn points if the outcome implemented by the group corresponds to the outcome of the coin flip. So while unbiased agents are willing to match the true outcome, biased agents try to enforce "Heads" by influencing the network. 
The game is repeated 48 times (varying distribution and location of biased and unbiased agents). 
We design two treatments: in the first treatment, only one agents out of five is a real participant, while in the second treatment, two agents out of five are real participants. The objective is to understand the social/human component in the spreading of rumors. "
