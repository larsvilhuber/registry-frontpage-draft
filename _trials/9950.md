abstract: "Emerging evidence suggests that bundling drought tolerant maize (DTM) and satellite-based index insurance (II) can foster resilience: the combined product not only helps farm households withstand shocks but allows them to deepen their investment in the wake of events that might otherwise prove crippling. These benefits, however, do not manifest themselves in all states of the world. The stochastic return on investment makes learning the value of the product challenging. This can delay the levels of sustained adoption necessary to generate large scale resilience. In this project, we will use a multi-armed randomized control trial to study subsidies to learning “through education” and “through experimentation”. Subsidy programs will be provided for two years and removed before the project’s final year. Removal of the subsidy will allow for a study of sustained adoption, both as it relates to the treatments and to the weather realizations experienced by households during the subsidy period. The project will generate additional evidence on the impact of DTM and II on maize yields, agricultural investment, and food security and builds on recent work by MRR Innovation Lab researchers and private sector partners, which led to the launch of Mozambique’s first commercial bundle of II and DTM."
