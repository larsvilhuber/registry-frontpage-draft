abstract: "This pre-registration analysis plan concerns the second wave of the study titled 'An online experiment on attitudes towards temporary protection of refugees and helping behaviours in the EU,' with initial registration in July 2022 (RCT ID: AEARCTR-0009682). As in the first wave, the second wave of this study investigates the Europeans’ attitudes towards temporary protection of refugees, evaluating how these attitudes vary with the demographic traits of the people displaced, reasons why they had to leave their country, and the rights covered under temporary protection (e.g., access to housing, medical care). It also evaluates the extent to which individuals can be persuaded to adopt more inclusionary attitudes towards refugees by being stimulated to take the perspective of a refugee or by reading narratives that give a refugee’s perspective. This document extends the analysis plan to the data from the second wave, including hypotheses and methods for analysing a new randomised belief-correction intervention and comparing results from the first and the second wave."
