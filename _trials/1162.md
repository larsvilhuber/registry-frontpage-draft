abstract: "Small-scale vendors in urban slums around the world face considerable inefficiencies in their value chains for inputs that result in high travel costs and higher input prices, and limited product diversity for consumers. For example, vendors in the slums of Bogota spend an average of 15 hours per week and 20 percent of their weekly revenue travelling to make inventory purchases, and because they purchase small quantities at any point in time, do not benefit from bulk discounts. There is a coordination failure amongst such firms, since competition and lack of trust between each other prevents them from banding together to share travel costs and combine discounts. A start-up based in Colombia, aims to overcome this problem by leveraging mobile phone technology to aggregate small vendorsâ€™ demand for produce, creating collective orders which add up to wholesale quantities, and delivering the goods directly to firms from farms, cutting out middlemen in the supply chain. This impact evaluation will test the effectiveness of this new technology.
This approach will be tested in a pilot program in Bogota. A census of 2,500 vegetable vendors in poor neighborhoods in the south of Bogota was conducted, and these firms were subdivided into 60 geographic blocks. Within each block, the baseline survey assesses whether or not firms would be interested in using the services . We then randomly assign 30 of these blocks to be treatment blocks, and 30 to be control. Within each treated block, those firms which indicated their interest in the  program will be marketed the service. High-frequency surveys will then measure the prices, unit costs, travel time, and profits and sales of both interested and uninterested firms in treatment and control blocks over time.
