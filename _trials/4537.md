abstract: "Disclosure rates for sexual orientation data are often lower than for other demographic data such as ethnicity. It is important to increase willing disclosure of sexual orientation data to ensure that employers can identify potential biases in their recruitment processes and implement appropriate adjustments to make them fairer. We are testing the impact of messaging on increasing willing disclosure rates of sexual orientation data during recruitment. In a 4-armed randomised controlled trial, applicants starting a job application see either the current form or three alternative simple messages that aim to address different key potential reasons for non-disclosure. These are 1) mistrust in the secure handling of their demographic data, 2) the belief that disclosure would harm the application, and 3) not understanding the purpose of providing such data. "
