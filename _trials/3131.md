abstract: "Economists have studied preferences for fairness over gains for decades, often using Dictator games in experimental laboratories. This body of literature suggests Dictators are altruistic, even towards strangers. In this experiment, we aim to examine preferences for fairness over losses. I.e., how do Dictators choose to split losses, as opposed to gains? "
