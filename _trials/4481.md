abstract: "A frequently observed behavior in online auctions is jump bidding: a strategy in which bidders place higher bids than what is necessary to become the current highest bidder. While multiple theories explaining jump bidding in ascending auctions exist (e.g. Avery, 1998; Isaac, Salmon & Zillante, 2007), there is hardly any consensus on the direction and size of the effect of jump bidding on the sellerâ€™s revenue. We therefore design an experiment to evaluate the effect of jump bidding behavior on the final price of an auctioned item, under controlled conditions. In randomized controlled trials, we either (i) do not bid (control), (ii) make an early jump bid far below the estimated value of the item, or (iii) make incremental bids up to the value of the jump bid made in condition (ii). We test whether the bidding behavior by others and the final price differ between experimental conditions. Understanding the effects of jump bidding behavior may help design more efficient online auctions and prevent market failure.
