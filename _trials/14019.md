abstract: "Curiosity and creativity are crucial for the accumulation of human capital and economic development, especially in the era of AI. At the same time, the integration of AI and education has become a significant driving force for educational reform. In this study, we aim to explore the following: Whether AI-generated praise and encouragement targeting students' curiosity in homework feedback is effective, that is, whether it can enhance students' curiosity and creativity? Whether students' responses to homework feedback differ based on the disclosure of the AI's identity? Whether there are differences in the effectiveness of AI-generated text-based and voice-based homework feedback?
