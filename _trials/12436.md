abstract: "Human trafficking in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) is believed to be widespread among youth and young adults (YYAs), but there has been no comprehensive study estimating the prevalence of trafficking in SADC countries. In the baseline phase of this project, we will first establish labor trafficking prevalence estimates among YYA aged 18-37 in 6 study districts. This will be followed by a randomized controlled trial (RCT) on a financial capability intervention"
