abstract: "The lack of adequate literacy preparation is a key risk factor for poor performance in primary school worldwide (Behrman et al, 2006). Even in Kenya, one of the best-educated populations in Sub-Saharan Africa, only 34% of preschool children meet language and numeracy development milestones (Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, 2013). The proposed research builds on a cluster-randomized evaluation of an early literacy intervention that combined dialogic reading training for parents of young children with mother tongue childrenâ€™s storybooks. Participation in the early literacy program was over 89% of targeted households under intensive researcher-managed recruitment, with 91% of participants being mothers and other female caregivers. Short-term results show that the intervention improved language development and school-readiness, particularly for children of illiterate primary caregivers. The present trial is aimed at identifying pathways for effective scale-up by testing 1) whether public pre-primary school teachers can improve participation by illiterate parents whose children would most benefit from the program, and 2) whether a bundled father encouragement recruitment strategy can increase participation of fathers and other male caregivers. The results of the trial will inform potential integration of the intervention into ongoing reforms of the pre-primary curriculum and come at the request of county-level government officials who are enthusiastic about the program.
