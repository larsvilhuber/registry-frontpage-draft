abstract: "The project aims to understand the impact of mentoring programs on high school students in Catalonia, Spain, with a focus on their performance and persistence in tertiary education. Additionally, it investigates the disparities in outcomes between being paired with a volunteer mentor versus an educational technician (ET). Employing randomized controlled trials at two levels – first at the school level and then within pairs of individuals – the project seeks to evaluate short and medium-term educational outcomes. These outcomes include persistence in tertiary education and career satisfaction. Volunteers, typically university students or graduates residing in Spain, offer firsthand experience, while ETs oversee pairs and provide mentorship. By assessing the effects of these interventions, the project aims to offer insights into effective strategies for improving educational equity and career outcomes. It considers varying approaches and resource allocations between volunteer and professional mentors."
