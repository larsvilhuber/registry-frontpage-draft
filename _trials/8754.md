abstract: "The recent expansion in digital financial service (DFS) and related technologies in developing countries has opened the door to many issues related to consumer protection, including fraud. Fraud creates direct costs for affected consumers and can erode trust in specific providers or entire markets. The project focuses on phone scams, the most prevalent form of fraud related to DFS in Kenya. Using mixed methods, we develop a measure of scam identification ability (SIA) and implement in a large-scale online survey in Kenya."
