abstract: "Welfare recipients in Spain often lack basic personal and digital skills. Training in those skills is not provided in the current welfare system in Ceuta. The intervention proposes training in these basic personal and digital skills. The IMVOLUCRA2 project aims to achieve two objectives. One is to verify that the training in basic personal skills has a differential effect on the employability and attitude of people in the Active Job Search (AJS). The second is to verify that the specific training in digital activities for employment has a differential and/or joint effect with basic personal skills on the employability and attitude of people in Active Job Search. These objectives will be achieved through a Randomized Control Trial with a control group and two treatment groups. The first treatment group receives training in personal skills, and the second treatment group receives personal and digital skills training. The treatment and main control group will have around 233 participants (approximately 700 participants in total)."
