abstract: "Misinformation abounds, particularly on the internet and social media. Previous studies have focused on the demand side of misinformation, but much less in known about the supply side: Who and under what circumstances are people willing to manipulate or fabricate data that can rapidly spread on social media? Our study will address these questions by studying workersâ€™ willingness to create misleading graphs about the current Covid-19 pandemic. Anecdotal evidence suggests misleading graphs about the Covid-19 pandemic are proliferating on social media, contributing to hostile protests and further jeopardizing public health. Leveraging an online field experiment, we plan to hire workers on MTurk and ask them to create misleading graphs about Covid-19 death rates. We will randomly assign workers to conditions that vary whether they are being asked to manipulate data. Our main outcome variables are (i) whether workers will complete the job, (ii) how strongly they will manipulate the data, and (iii) how misleading the public perceives the manipulated graphs. By examining the supply side of misinformation, this research contributes to stopping the spread of misinformation, broadly, and health misinformation, specifically, on social media and social technology platforms."
