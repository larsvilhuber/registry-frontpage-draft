abstract: "Lead poisoning, largely due to informal recycling of lead acid batteries from vehicles, causes widespread health problems, cognitive disabilities, violent crime and lost economic productivity. In Bangladesh, lead emissions are increasing with adoption of electric three wheelers powered by lead acid batteries. Our research shows that batteries in the market are very low quality with very short life, increasing the rate of informal recycling and associated lead emissions. To increase adoption of high quality long lasting lead and lithium batteries, we have developed new business models that we will tests in a randomized framework in partnership with a large microfinance organization and two leading battery manufacturers in Bangladesh.  Our study will aim to derive broader academic and policy insights to increase adoption of sustainable and durable goods in developing economies to improve the circular economy of durable goods and reduce toxic pollution from informal recycling of materials.
