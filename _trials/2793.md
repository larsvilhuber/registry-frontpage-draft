abstract: "Does the participation in co-innovation training activities influence industry participantsâ€™ intentions to engage in university-industry co-innovation projects?
The aim of this pilot study is to explore the motivations of industry players to engage, or not, in collaborative innovation (co-innovation) projects. Training activities which engage university and industry participants can be a determinant for formal innovation and entrepreneurial projects. The trial objective is to determine the effects of tailored training programmes focused on modifying the co-innovation intention and its cognitive antecedents. This trial will be run in the border region of Southern Denmark."
