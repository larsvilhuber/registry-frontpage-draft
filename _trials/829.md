abstract: "This experiment evaluates the effectiveness of using parental engagement to improve student attendance. We address three main research questions:
RQ1: Does contacting guardians and encouraging them to improve their students’ attendance reduce absences?
RQ2: Does communicating to guardians the total number of days their student missed reduce absences?
RQ3: Does communicating to guardians the total number of days their student missed as compared to the absences of a typical student reduce absences?

We also address the exploratory research question:
RQ4: Do these interventions also impact the attendance of other students in the household not explicitly mentioned in the mailings?

The three main research questions can be condensed into three behavioral-psychology-motivated components:
1. ENCOURAGE – Reaching out to guardians and encouraging them to improve student attendance
2. SELF – Informing guardians about their students’ absences
3. NORMS – Comparing students’ absences to what’s “normal”

This is conducted in a large urban district in the US and involves over 30,000 households. "
