abstract: "This analysis will estimate the effects of enumerators on wellbeing in Africa.  Based on an existing exploratory analysis, this second part of the paper serves as a replication to the initial analysis which looked to determine if there were enumerator effects.  The initial results indicate that there are enumerator effects. The purpose in this second round of replication is to see if there is a difference in responses to the question on wellbeing based on the nationality of enumerator (African versus American), and to test for manipulation checks.  Thus, this second round will specify a hypotheses based on the first round of data and then test that hypothesis with new data from a new cluster.  "
