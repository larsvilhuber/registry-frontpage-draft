abstract: "Approximately 75 percent of children aged 2 to 4 worldwide - close to 300 million - are regularly subjected to violent discipline (physical punishment and/or psychological aggression) by parents and/or caregivers at home (UNICEF, 2017). While parenting styles and decisions are crucial in driving human capital accumulation, violence against children is often rationalized as necessary or inevitable. The evidence about the effectiveness of violence prevention parenting programs is scarce. Moreover, the effects of shifting the delivery of a parenting program from an in-person to a digital format are scarce and ambiguous. Results from a global systematic review show that high-quality parenting programs at scale are needed globally.

This research project aims to measure the impact of a virtual intervention (IRIE Homes) that provides caregivers access to support and guidance by specialists regarding positive parenting skills. By conducting a randomized control trial with approximately 1,200 caregivers in Jamaica, we will measure the causal impacts of this intervention on caregiver attitudes to violence against children, child maltreatment or abuse, child emotional and conduct problems, and caregiversâ€™ mental health."
