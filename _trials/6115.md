abstract: "The nature of scientific uncertainty is that even the probability distribution is uncertain for someone to make a decision. This situation is called Knightian uncertainty (ambiguity) in economics, and it is widely known that people's behaviors in the presence of Knightian uncertainty have unique features. Under high ambiguity, when players are pessimistic (optimistic, resp.), the players come to think that the infection rate  is unlikely (likely, resp.) to be low independently of the amount of social distancing. As a result, higher ambiguity discourage both pessimistic and optimistic players to conduct social distancing. To test the prediction above, we design a survey experiment where respondents are presented statements of scientific knowledge with different degrees of uncertainty. "
