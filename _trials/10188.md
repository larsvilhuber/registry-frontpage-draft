abstract: "Foreign languages are increasingly important in this internationalized society, especially for immigrants, non-native students, and workers in multinational corporations. We examine whether being exposed to a non-native language environment would affect economic decision-making. To explore this effect, we give a reading and listening test to subjects in foreign/native language, then we elicit their individual preferences using their native language. This study aims to clarify the causes of irrational decision-making and provide language policy implications concerning immigrants."
