abstract: "This study is a market experiment, designed to measure whether and how mothers and other caregivers are likely to buy and use a variety of premixed, packaged fortified cereals for infant feeding.  Respondents are identified through market intercepts at times and places selected to reach respondents from a wide range of socioeconomic circumstances.  We then use a discrete choice experiment to test whether using a fortified cereal at home would displace plain starchy staples and thereby improve diet quality, or substitute for healthier family foods such as greens, beans and other nutrient-dense dishes. We also use a random-price auction to elicit each respondent's willingness to purchase at each price. 

As part of the market experiment we conduct a randomized trial to test whether alternative marketing messages and label claims affect whether fortified cereals displace nutrient-dense family foods, or just replace starchy staples.  In the control arm, the fortified cereal is described as "made especially for infants, with more nutrients than ordinary maize."  In the marketing treatment, the fortified cereal is described as "made especially for infants, with many of the nutrients in greens, beans, fruits & vegetables".  These statements correspond to marketing messages and product packages currently observed in a variety of fortified infant cereals sold around the world.  We hypothesize that respondents in both treatment arms will substitute the fortified porridge for plain maize rather than a nutrient-dense family food. Both statements are accurate descriptions, but if the second script is associated with significant substitution of the fortified porridge for greens and beans, that would provide suggestive evidence favoring policies that restrict this type of marketing message, for example by requiring labels to show only porridge and not include images of other nutrient-dense foods.  

Our market experiment is followed by a standard random-price auction to measure each respondent's willingness-to-pay for a variety of locally-available fortified infant foods, accompanied by demographic questions about the respondent, her child and her household, including standard 24-hour recall modules for infant feeding practices and maternal diet quality, as well as knowledge and experience with contaminants in food.  With these data we can characterize willingness-to-pay and marginal rates of substitution among different categories of respondents, to inform policies and programs relating to adoption and use of fortified infant cereals. These policies could have an important influence on infant feeding and child development.  The World Health Organization and other authorities recommend gradual introduction of nutrient-dense foods after six months of exclusive breastfeeding, with the quality, quantity and frequency of each feeding playing a key role in nutrient adequacy until the child can digest sufficient quantities of the family diet after two years of age. 

The trial is part of a larger study of food quality and child diets.  For that, the marketplace survey and field experiment is accompanied by key informant interviews with government officials, nutritionists, food manufacturers and retailers regarding the policy processes and market opportunities that drive availability and use of fortified cereals, aiming to inform the development of quality standards and marketing principles to improve child nutrition in low- and middle-income countries.
