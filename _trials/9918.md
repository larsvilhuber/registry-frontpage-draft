abstract: "We implement a field experiment on team diversity in an undergraduate class of introductory Economics. Small groups with random compositions are generated, and they are assigned several common tasks. We study the impact of a multidimensional measure of diversity based on gender, race, migration status and socio-economic background on collaboration, group dynamics and group performance, with a focus on in-group and out-group dynamics. We further analyse individual impacts such as individual performance in the class, aspirations, and general student well-being. Finally, we investigate optimal group composition according to performance and other welfare functions including non-cognitive outcomes."
