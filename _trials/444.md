abstract: "The "Boarding Schools Targetnig Excellence" initiative (Internats d’Excellence) aimed to promote equal opportunities in French schools by providing a supportive learning environment to middle and high school students from disadvantaged backgrounds in the form of a boarding schools. The first pilot boarding school opened in September 2009 at Sourdun (Seine-et-Marne local authority in the school district of Créteil). Researchers from J-PAL carried out a three-year randomized controlled trial, funded by the Fonds d’expérimentation pour la jeunesse (the French Experimental Fund for the Youth), in order to measure the impact of the Sourdun boarding school on students’ aspirations, behavior and academic performance. The results show that an ambitious school policy can have major impacts on educational outcomes for underserved students, but only after the second year, probably because it takes time for most students to adjust to stringent discipline and high academic demands in the school, as evidenced by the evolution of their non-cognitive outcomes (well-being, self-confidence, etc.)."
