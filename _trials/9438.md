abstract: "Online courses issuing certificates have gotten substantially more popular over recent years. However, it is unclear how valuable such non-traditional certificates are in the labor market. We study this in the context of the Coursera platform, one of the largest online course providers.

The existing evidence of the value of credentials gained from online courses is generally based on observational data where the selection of unobservable characteristics is a major concern (see e.g., Hadavand 2018). To address this issue, we carry out a randomized controlled experiment in which the treatment group receives a behavioral nudge in the form of an in-app notification encouraging posting the credential on LinkedIn. Additionally, the treatment group receives a new substantially simplified process of adding the credential to the profile. In this way, we leverage the fact that many users do not post their certificates to create an exogenous variation in their usage.

We are primarily interested in whether learners in the treatment group achieve better job market outcomes than learners in the control group. We also analyze the heterogeneity of the treatment effects. Additionally, we study the impact of the treatment on the usage of the credential.

In the experiment we include subjects who have recently graduated from a STEM course on Coursera and do not have a college degree or come from a developing country. This choice is based on findings from a pilot experiment run by Coursera in the past."
