abstract: "Idle youth are an important segment of the population in many developing countries. Medellín, Colombia, is no exemption. Promoting opportunities for a better future might improve social welfare in the long run while improving youth lives immediately. We partnered with the Secretariat of Youth of Medellín to test two types of psychological interventions: cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and experience-based group therapy. The experimental sample consists of around 1400 idle youth between 14 to 28 years old. We randomly assigned each youth to (i) 8 individual sessions of CBT, (ii) 4 sessions of experience-based group therapy, (iii) 8 individual sessions of CBT and 4 sessions of experience-based group therapy, or (iv) control. To randomize into treatment arms, we stratified by a mental health score (measured with GAD7 and PHQ9 tests), a social vulnerability score, and gender. We will measure impacts on education, access to formal work, participation in criminal activities, and mental health."
