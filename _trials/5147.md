abstract: "This RCT studies the effects of exposure to anti-finance rhetoric on individual choice under risk as well as the economic channels that might transmit any effects. Whether anti-finance rhetoric is a cultural byproduct of economic crises or whether it might in turn affect economic choices is an open and unexplored question, which can be barely tackled in the field due to the fact that anti-finance rhetoric arises in times of economic crises when other major aggregate and individual economic shocks affect decision-making. To answer this question, I recruit 400 subjects on a large US-based internet platform. I restrict the sample to users with a US tax identifier. The experimental condition consists of exposing subjects randomly to one of two experimental arms, i.e. a control arm and an anti-finance rhetoric arm. In the control arm, subjects read a text on a short introduction about the role of stock markets and their players, as well as the pros and cons of investing in stocks. In the anti-finance rhetoric arm, I replace ideologically neutral cues of the control text with anti-finance rhetoric cues typical of the Occupy Wall Street movement as studied in Applied Linguistics and Sociology. The aim of this intervention is to randomly manipulate the salience of anti-finance rhetoric. After the manipulation, subjects perform a set of investment choices under risk a la Gneezy and Potters (2009), lottery choice tasks a la Holt and Laury (2002), and answer a set of questions about their trust in a set of institutions, including the stock market and investment banks, among others.
