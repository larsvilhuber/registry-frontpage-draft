abstract: "This paper aims at shedding light on the question how trust and solidarity among European cititzens are affected by information treatments on a) the diffential affectedness of EU member states in the current crisis, b) the economic benefit through EU trade and c) the strength of European identity. In addition, the study will analyze how policy preferences in various domains and further attitudinal outcome variables are affected by the treatments. To that end, we will conduct online surveys in nine EU member states and two non-EU countries which will enable us to investigate differential treatment effects on trust and solidarity towards compatriots as well as citizens from EU and non-EU countries."
