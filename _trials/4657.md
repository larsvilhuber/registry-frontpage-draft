abstract: "Background: One of the most common complications in patients with hemodialysis is malnutrition. Therefore it is necessary to manage basic nutrition because a number of patients have difficulty managing diets that adversely affect mortality and morbidity. The purpose of this study was to identify the effect of collaborative nutrition program interventions by involving families on nutritional status, self-management and family involvement. Method: The Randomized Control Trial research design with intervention group (n = 20) was given a collaborative nutrition program including nutritional assessment, diet management, education, and counseling every 2 weeks for 8 weeks and the control group (n = 19) was given education according to the standard. Results: In the intervention group, the Malnutrition Inflamation Score decreased from the initial measurement of 9.0 ± 1.94 to 5.2 ± 1.0 with a significance of p <0.001 compared to the results of the control group. Laboratory parameters Self-management increased from the initial measurement of 25.15 ± 2.66 to 31.95 ± 2.08 at eight weeks with a value of p <0.001 compared to the control group. Family involvement increased from the initial measurement of 23.10 ± 3.52 to 31.20 ± 2.11 with a p value <0.001 compared to the control group. Conclusion: Hemodialysis patients who are given a collaborative nutrition education program involving the family can improve nutritional status, self-management and family involvement"
