abstract: "In this project we first study the willingness of politicians to invest in their careers. We conduct an experiment where we invite politicians to attend a training workshop. The invitation varies in the kinds of information presented to the politician. Second, we randomize whether politicians attend the training itself and study the impact of this training on their performance. "
