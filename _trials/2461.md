abstract: "Mongolia is a lower-middle income country characterized by high youth unemployment and a large informal sector. Training programs have been implemented to promote employment and tackle these issues. In this study, we evaluate the impact of a vocational training program (VTP) through a field experiment conducted between 2013 and 2015. This time frame allows us to explore short and medium term impacts. We focus on three outcomes of interest: employment, earnings and job quality. We also want to investigate how the high dropout rate registered in the VTP program is related to the fact that participants ignore the potential gains of the training in terms of wages and employments."
