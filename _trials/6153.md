abstract: "This is an ex-post registration of a RCT conducted in 2014-15.

The main purpose of the study was to evaluate the impacts of an index insurance pilot on cotton growing households in Burkina Faso. We were particularly interested in assessing whether, and to what extent, insured farmers increase their investment in cotton production and adjust their portfolio of agricultural activities once cotton production, which is profitable but risky, is insured. 

The insurance is based on an area-yield index (as described in Elabel et al., 2013) and is sold as part of the cotton credit package distributed by the local cotton company to groups of cotton farmers (GPCs). The insurance intervention was randomized in two steps. First, half of the 80 GPCs who are part of the study were randomly selected to be offered the insurance. Thus, the treatment area comprises 40 farmer groups, whereas the 40 farmer groups in the control area could not purchase the insurance (insurance contracts were not generated for these groups to prevent from contamination entirely). Second, an encouragement design was generated among the treatment group by randomly distributing insurance subsidy coupons to farmer groups. Ten GPCs received no subsidy, ten a 25% subsidy, ten a 50% subsidy and ten a 75% subsidy.

Around 13 farmers per GPC were randomly selected to participate to a baseline and a follow-up survey. A total of 1015 households were thus surveyed first in January 2014, before the first insurance sales that took place in May-June 2014. The follow-up survey was conducted in January 2015 following the cotton harvest. We collected detailed information on agricultural production and investments at the plot level, as well as detailed household information.
