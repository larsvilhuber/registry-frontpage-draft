abstract: "This experimental study aims to explore the potential impact of sporting events on the relationships between participating parties, with a particular focus on whether such events can alleviate tensions, foster cooperation, and enhance economic exchanges within specific historical, cultural, and economic contexts. The study involves randomly selecting individuals and sending them evaluations of sporting events to measure their willingness to engage with the participating parties. By analyzing experimental data from international sporting events, the study examines changes in trade willingness, tourism willingness, and social intentions among the parties during and after the events."
