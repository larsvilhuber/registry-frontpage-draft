abstract: "This research will evaluate the impact of an intervention to provide microfranchising opportunities to young women in Nairobi, Kenya. The research aims to measure the direct impact of a microfranchising intervention on program participants and the indirect impacts of the program on pre-existing businesses in the area of the intervention. 

To measure the direct impact on program participants, the research conducts two surveys of participants in the second wave of a micofranchising program being implemented by in six Nairobi neighborhoods. The two surveys comprise: a baseline survey of applicants who will subsequently be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups or a control (non-treated comparison) group and an endline impact evaluation survey of up to 2000 women who complete the baseline survey. The two treatment groups are designed to compare the relative impact of access to the microfranchising opportunity and access to a cash grant of comparable value. The research will focus on the impact of the treatment opportunities on young women’s labor supply, income and expenditures, savings, empowerment and self-actualization, and overall well-being. 

To measure the indirect impact on pre-existing businesses, the research project also includes an enterprise census and a monthly enterprise survey.  The census will identify businesses operating in the sectors and neighborhoods of interest, a subset of whom will then be invited to join the enterprise survey.  The enterprise survey will be conducted on a monthly basis surrounding the start of the microfranchising program and will focus on the employment, labor supply, revenues and profits of the firm.
