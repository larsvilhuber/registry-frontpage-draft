abstract: "It is our mainly aim to estimate direct causal effects of door-to-door combined with a foot-in-the-door technique during an extensive canvasing compared with previous studies. Our hypothesis is that a level of interaction between a neighbor and a candidate would promote gratitude or indebtedness related to the aspects of the relationship between the agents. In order to do so, we run an experiment in some localities of La Plata.
