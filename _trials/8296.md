abstract: "In this project, we study whether candidates for a real job behave differently when they are informed their application will be evaluated by AI relative to a human evaluator. We also study the differences in the characteristics of candidates recommended by AI relative to a human evaluator and perceptions of AI recruitment tools. Finally, we attempt to understand any potential differences between AI and human evaluations. "
