abstract: "This project explores gender differences in willingness to lead (WTL) in a controlled laboratory environment, and seeks to identify underlying mechanisms. The primary goal of the study is to explore the effect of confidence on willingness to lead. In particular, we ask whether women are more hesitant to become leaders because they are less confident in their ability, and in which leadership setting confidence is more likely to drive the decision to become leader. To isolate the effect of confidence on WTL, factors such as performance, risk aversion, and gender stereotypes are measured, and backlash against female leaders is ruled out as total anonymity is maintained. The study examines two different contexts of leadership. In the first context, which we call ‘responsibility’, leaders are responsible for making decisions on behalf of the group following input from group members. In the second, which we call ‘influence’, followers make their own decisions, but leaders have the opportunity to persuade the group to adopt their viewpoint. These settings are designed such that the effort required from leaders (writing a message to explain their rationale) is identical between the two, and the difference lies in how the leader’s input determines payoffs. Participants are randomly assigned to one of these two settings and perform the same task twice, once individually and once as part of a group. The task is identical in both settings and consists in ranking objects according to their importance for survival in different scenarios. In line with previous research, we expect to find that women are reluctant to volunteer for leadership roles. We hypothesize that gender differences in confidence explain a significant part of the gender gap in WTL."
