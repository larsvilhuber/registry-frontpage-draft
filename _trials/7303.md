abstract: "This document describes the pre-analysis plan to evaluate the effects of two complementary interventions designed to improve students' understanding of the postsecondary education opportunities they have available. These interventions focus on students enrolled in vocational high schools in Chile. Our sample consists of 210 schools organized in 160 school networks. To evaluate the interventions, high schools will be randomly assigned (at the school network level) into three groups: a pure a control group, an information-only treatment group, and a combination of information and mentoring treatment group. Students in any of the treatment groups will receive a personalized information package describing funding opportunities and the benefits of attending higher education. The mentoring treatment will be randomly assigned to four students per class. The design of the intervention includes features that allow us to study the spillovers of the mentoring program on the social network of treated individuals. With this last part of the experiment, we aim to understand to which extent social spillovers could be used to design more efficient and effective interventions to allow students to make informed decisions about their post-secondary education trajectories. This pre-analysis plan provides some background information on the intervention, outlines the study design, and describes the inference and estimation procedures."
