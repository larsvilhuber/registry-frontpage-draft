abstract: "Financial education interventions have become widespread in recent years and seek to strengthen the financial knowledge and behavior of consumers and small-scale entrepreneurs. However, recent systematic reviews of the literature (Fernandes et al. 2014; Miller et al. 2015) question the effectiveness of such programs to target individual financial behavior. Recent experiments go beyond estimations of average treatment effects of a single program, but complement these findings with evidence on orthogonal treatments designed to study the causal mechanism behind these interventions. However, the role of differential pedagogical approaches and design is a surprisingly underresearched issue in the financial education literature. This cluster-randomized field experiment evaluates the comparative effectiveness of two financial literacy trainings offered to small-scale retailers in the Rwenzori-region in western Uganda. The two treatments experimentally vary the use of visuals, narratives and participant involvement. Thus, we are able to study the relative importance of the pedagogical design in financial education interventions and shed light on the causal mechanism underlying the observed behavioral changes expected from these kinds of interventions.
