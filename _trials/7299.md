abstract: "Existing experimental evidence on the contact hypothesis Allport (1954) has mainly used long and unstructured interventions, with implications for replicability and scalability of existing contact protocols. We here test the effect of brief contacts, using a structured protocol that can be implemented in wide range of situations at a reasonable cost. We also examine the targeting of populations that are more suited to contact interventions based on pre-experimental contact with out-group members. Contact is found to be effective at increasing trust when prior exposure to out-group is low and no effect is found when prior exposure to out-group is high. "
