abstract: "The take-up of social benefits, defined as the proportion of individuals who apply for a given social benefit in the eligible population, is an important consideration in designing, budgeting and evaluating government policies.  A limit of a certain range of welfare policies comes from the fact that a large proportion of individuals who are entitled to social benefits choose not to claim them. The recent literature in economics and sociology suggests that the lack of information may be an important factor affecting take-up. Potential beneficiaries may be unfamiliar with the existence of some social benefits, their associated eligibility rules and amounts. Consequently, they may form the often incorrect belief that they are not eligible or that the amount they will receive is too small to justify the cost and effort involved in applying.

To address this issue, our project evaluates the effect of an online social benefits simulator called mes-aides and created by a government agency responsible for modernising government services (SGMAP) on the take-up of social benefits in France. This simulator covers a wide range of both local and state social benefits, and offers individualised information on eligibility and on the amounts to which potential beneficiaries might be eligible. We focus our analysis on a population which is likely to require social benefits: people who recently registered as unemployed or for whom unemployment insurance will soon come to its end. We evaluate the effect of inviting these potential beneficiaries to use the site, and the impact that performing a simulation has on their benefit take-up. We also measure the added benefit of having an interactive and personalized web-based intervention, as compared to sending static and generic information e-mails.
