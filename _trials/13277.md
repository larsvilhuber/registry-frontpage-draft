abstract: "This research investigates the impact of the advisor's identity—human versus artificial intelligence (AI)—on trust and blame allocation following incorrect advice. Advisors give advice on projects and recommend whether participants should or should not invest. Participants may or may not follow this advice and could potentially change their behavior toward their assigned advisor in round two by trusting and being influenced more or less by the advisor’s advice. We randomly assign participants to one of five types of advisors: i) human advisors, ii) AI advisors, iii) AI advisors combined with a short informational video on AI, iv) anthropomorphized AI (female), or  v) anthropomorphized AI (female).
