abstract: "The project consists of a large-scale randomized controlled trial to analyze the impact of a pilot intervention aimed at supporting job seekers in their pursuit of successful labor market (re)integration. The intervention, implemented in Turkey, will be delivered as part of the existing employment support services of the national public employment agency. It will focus newly registered jobseekers, or those who are registering again after a work spell. In particular, job seekers will be provided with information to influence their employment expectations as well as evidence-based tools to inform and set job search goals and with practical strategies to persevere and sustain the motivation to overcome obstacles and setbacks. We expect this intervention to increase job search intensity, take-up of ALMP services and, as a consequence, the probability of employment. "
