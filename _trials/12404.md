abstract: "Despite the significant increase in women working in traditionally masculine sectors, the presence of women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) fields, and thus in high-pay and high-status professions, is still scarce. 
Previous experimental studies found that exposing individuals to theories of sex differences, attributing the cause of these differences to either biological or social factors, affects stereotype endorsement, self-stereotyping, interest in STEM and performance in a math-related task. However, the existing studies on the effect of essentialist beliefs on attitudes toward role models are too scarce to provide a clear picture of how the endorsement of fixed versus malleable theories of traits could mediate the efficacy of interventions using role models. 
The study aims to test the effect of the endorsement of gender essentialist beliefs on attitudes toward and perceptions of women interested in STEM. It is hypotesized that people endorsing essentialist beliefs on gender would have worse attitudes toward women in STEM and would be more likely to see female counterstereotypical role models as exceptions (subtyping effect) compared to both people thinking that gender differences either do not exist or are due to social factors. 
The hypotheses are tested using a randomized control trial with parallel design where essentialist beliefs are manipulated asking participants to read an article on gender (sex) differences in math abilities. Participants are recruited by a panel provider based in Italy and are paid for their participation. The experiment is conducted online. In study 1, 200 participants aged 16-20 are randomly assigned to an article either suggesting that gender differences do not exist, that exist but are due to social factors or that are due to biological differences. They are then asked to answer a questionnaire measuring attitudes toward women in science and gender stereotypes about science. In study 2, 150 participants aged 16-20 are randomly assigned to the same articles (biological differences or no differences), they are then exposed to counterstereotypical role models and asked their opinion on their gender typicality. Their gender bias is also measured. "
