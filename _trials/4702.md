abstract: "This study examines whether receiving an associate's degree from a community college harms a graduate's labor market prospect, conditional on the graduate also having received a bachelor's degree. Furthermore, if we detect any such effect on labor market outcomes, this study examines whether the effect is due to statistical discrimination or due to pure stigma against community college graduates."
