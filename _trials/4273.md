abstract: "We use a larger-scale experiment conducted with 1,818 Brazilian municipalities to estimate the impact of providing research information to policymakers on actual policy adoption. A randomly selected treatment group of 881 mayors was invited to attend an hour-long research information session. An experienced presenter informed attending mayors about a set of rigorous research studies showing large effects of a taxpayer reminder letter policy on tax compliance. 15 to 24 months later, we re-interview tax-department bureaucrats and mayors about policy adoption.
