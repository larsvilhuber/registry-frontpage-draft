abstract: "We study the comparative effect of two types of social comparison nudges, mobilized in an empirical framework of support to winegrowers in limiting the overdose of phytosanitary products for the protection of their vines. Three groups of winegrowers from the same Bordeaux region were randomly constituted: two action groups each receiving one type of nudge, and a control group. Their phytosanitary practices are monitored for several years, making it possible to measure the effect of these interventions, but also to analyze the real basis of their functioning."
