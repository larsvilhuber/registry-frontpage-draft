abstract: "According to the last available PISA data, Italy is one of the countries with the highest gender gap in mathematics, and the gender gap in mathematics in Piedmont is even higher. Therefore, Piedmont represents a good case study to test new methods devised at tackling the math gender gap.
Many explanations have been proposed for the existence of a gender gap in mathematics. Among other factors affecting math performance, the educational methods and practices used in class matter. Many studies show that when mathematicsâ€™ teaching is centred upon problem solving, involving students in discussions and investigative work as opposed to traditional passive methods, the gender gap in math decreases and can even disappear.
The objective of the project is to devise a teaching method, designed incorporating recommendations from the existing literature and own analysis of existing data, that aims to narrow the gender gap in mathematics and to measure the impact of this method on Piedmont children in primary school. Due to the type of intervention, we also evaluate the impact of the applied teaching practices on the math skills of all children, which is likely to be the first and strongest effect.
We conduct a randomized control trial to evaluate the impact of the implemented teaching methodology on math skills and on the gender gap in mathematics. The intervention covers about 50 third grade classes in 25 schools, evenly divided into treatment and control classes, involving about 1000 students. The gap will be reduced if math skills improvement is larger for girls, thanks to the specific design of the treatment.
