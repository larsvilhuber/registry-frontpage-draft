abstract: "The study aims to evaluate the impact of the Rural Finance Expansion Program (RUFEP), an initiative of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Zambia. The program’s goal is to improve the livelihood of rural communities by providing access to financial institutions. The population of interest is active members of Community-Based Financial Institutions (CBFIs) or saving groups, engaging in internal savings and credit schemes. These saving groups are supported and supervised by four Zambian implementing partners, which have a grant agreement with RUFEP. 
The first intervention of the study facilitates linking CBFIs to formal banks. Thereby, banks shall provide access to formal financial services for CBFIs and enable each saving group to increase their savings and loan capacity.
The second intervention involves an informal insurance component. The majority of saving groups have established a community-based microinsurance mechanism called Social Fund (SF), which aims to cover the most severe socio-economic shocks like illnesses or funerals. A set of recommendations is provided to the groups so that they would be able to increase the Social Fund’s capacity to alleviate the impact of socio-economic shocks. Key features of this recommendation consist of financial education regarding (micro) insurance combined with advocating an increase in member’s contributions which could lead to an increase in grants. 
The study is conducted as a Randomized Controlled Trial, comparing a control group with 3 treatment groups. Two treatment groups receive each intervention respectively, while the third treatment groups receives a combination of the two interventions."
