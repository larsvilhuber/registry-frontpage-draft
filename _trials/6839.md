abstract: "We investigate the extent to which thinking about different future scenarios related to Covid-19 pandemics and related restrictive measures affects cognitive function and perseverance in 6-12 aged children and adults in El Salvador. This is realized through a survey experiment where a scenario implying soft or strong restrictive measures related to movement and social activities is randomly primed before cognitive and perseverance tests are administered.
