abstract: "This study tests whether low-touch information provision can overcome barriers to entry in the undergraduate Economics major that may disparately impact underrepresented minority students, students from lower socioeconomics backgrounds, and women. I run a large-scale field experiment in an undergraduate Principles of Microeconomics course that examines the effect of information provision on students' beliefs about Economics, short-run course performance, and subsequent enrollment and majoring decisions."
