abstract: "In this study, we investigate how humans make predictions based on text-based information. Our objective is to use statements of loan purposes from a crowdfunding website as the text-based information. We examine how prediction efficiency changes when we include additional information such as gender, loan amount, and loan interest rate. Additionally, we explore if and how their decisions are affected when we provide experts’ opinions alongside the text-based information.

The rationale is that humans may use text-based information to predict whether a loan borrower is trustworthy and whether a loan may default. We hypothesize that when the text-based information is limited, the prediction is not significantly different from random guessing. We also hypothesize that humans may exhibit some gender bias in their predictions and that their accuracy may improve when additional screening information, such as loan amount and loan interest rate, is provided. Finally, we hypothesize that humans’ predictions may be influenced by both experts’ opinions and opinions generated by large language models (LLMs)."
