abstract: "We conduct a survey experiment to understand how beliefs regarding local public good quality affect support for public spending, using US state spending on higher education as a concrete example. Participants will be randomized into three groups. The first treatment group receives information about the graduation rate at public colleges in their state, a measure of the output quality. The second treatment group receives this same information as well as the state's graduation rate rank. The control group receives no information. We will measure the extent to which this information changes preferences for spending and other higher education policies. We will also examine how effect heterogeneity by political partisanship, attachment to the higher education system, and errors in beliefs. "
