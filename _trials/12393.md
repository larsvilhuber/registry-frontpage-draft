abstract: "The importance of social media in recruitment is increasing. More and more people are open about many aspects of their personal life in their SM profiles and evidence from employers surveys and correspondence studies suggests data from social media is increasingly used and increasingly important in the hiring process. However, correspondence studies do not identify the individual making the decision, and so, are limited in their ability to describe the mechanisms behind this result. In our study, we use an experiment simulating the screening of job applicants to elucidate how the recruiter evaluation of the candidate is affected by the interaction between recruiter characteristics such as gender, education, and attitudes toward the social media, applicant characteristics available through social media profiles and lack of social media profile.

This is the second stage of an experiment conducted in March 2022, - AEARCTR-0008793
This is a supplement based on the findings in the previous round and the request of a Journal we submitted to.
This time, the experiment will be conducted with participants with hiring experience."
