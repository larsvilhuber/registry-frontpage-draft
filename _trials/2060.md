abstract: "Despite the centrality of court adjudication to the rule of law, and of court-connected mediation programs to court adjudication, there has never been a well-executed and exhaustive study of mediation’s costs and benefits. This randomized control trial (“RCT”) of a court-connected mediation program, has taken place in an environment unusually hostile to evidence-based thinking, namely, the United States federal court system. Multiple outcome variables directly relevant to mediation’s alleged justifications will be measured. The RCT is critical to a resource allocation dispute ongoing within the federal judiciary, which has indicated its desire for more such evidence, and it will serve as a model for court systems in the United States and abroad."
