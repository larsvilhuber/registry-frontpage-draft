abstract: "A central question in designing optimal policies concerns the assignment of individuals with different observable characteristics to different treatments (policies). We study this question in the context of increasing worker’s performance by using the appropriate incentives. Concretely,  we study whether and to what extent the impact of incentive schemes on performance can be improved through a targeted assignment of the implemented scheme to the characteristics of the respective worker. To do so, we will run a set of large-scale real-effort experiments with approximately 6,000 workers on Amazon MTurk (see AEARCTR-0008212 for the first part of the study)."
