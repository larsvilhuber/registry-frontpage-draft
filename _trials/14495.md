abstract: "In this “sock puppets” experiment, we test whether the recommendation algorithm of a music streaming platform is biased in favor of titles from large economies (here, USA) to the detriment of titles from a small economy (here, France). To do this, we created fictitious users that vary along four dimensions. Firstly, they vary according to their preference for small-economy titles (No, Small, Large, Total). In addition, the profiles vary according to their location (France and USA), their preference for recent or old titles and whether or not they consume titles recommended by the algorithm. Each day of the experiment, users will consume titles in the Get Recommendations API according to their profile (input data). After each consumption phase, the recommended titles are recorded (output data). We can then compare the difference between the proportion of titles of one nationality in a user's input data and the proportion of titles of the same nationality in the recommendation list (output data). We can test whether the result varies according to the preference for the small-economy music, but also to the user's location, the age of the titles and whether the user consumes recommended titles.
