abstract: "This project will provide rigorous, experimental evidence of the cost-effectiveness of alternative programs to improve the nutritional status of vulnerable households with children under the age of five and women of reproductive age, with an emphasis on the 1,000 day windows of opportunity from pregnancy until a child's second birthday.  To do so, the study will conduct a cluster-randomized controlled trial in Rwanda that evaluates the impacts of two programs:  a multi-dimensional nutritional program typical of those implemented by USAID in many parts of the world, and a household grant program built to transfer an amount of money exactly equivalent from the perspective of the donor.  These two treatments are compared to a control group, namely a set of villages that receive neither program. This study design achieves a fundamental kind of cost-effectiveness benchmarking increasingly called for in recent years:  the comparison of a standard and widespread development intervention with the outcome that would occur if the cost of the intervention were simply given away to the beneficiaries for them to spend as they see fit.  The primary outcomes for the study are the anemia and anthropometrics of target children, as well as consumption, dietary diversity, and wealth of the households to which they belong."
