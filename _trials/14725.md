abstract: "This study aims to investigate the impact of bonus and penalty contracts on supervisors' reactions in the context of subjective performance evaluations. While subjective performance evaluations are commonly used to decide on variable bonus payments, research suggests that these evaluations are often biased upwards. Simultaneously, literature indicates that framing incentive contracts as penalties rather than bonuses is an effective way to motivate employees to exert more effort, due to loss aversion. Our study aims to bridge these two previously unconnected literature strands. We hypothesize that supervisors are even more lenient when employees work under a penalty contract compared to a bonus contract. Reasons, for example, may be that supervisors empathize with their employees, are afraid of adverse reactions by their employees, or do not want to harm their own self-image. To test our hypothesis, we conduct a lab experiment applying a principal-agent setting. Participants in the role of agents perform a real effort task, while those in the role of principals benefit from the agents' work and assess their performance."
