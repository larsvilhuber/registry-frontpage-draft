abstract: "This study employs a randomized control experiment featuring a dictator game and a representative participant pool (n=600) to establish the causal effect of information on inequality perception and altruistic behavior. The results show mixed effects of the information intervention on voluntary giving at the aggregate level. A closer investigation reveals that unlike with control subjects, the provision of inequality information encourages treated subjects to give more to an unknown non-profit organization but less to a random stranger, suggesting a stronger degree of institutional trust relative to interpersonal trust. Exposure to inequality statistics is also found to lower subjective well-being among the treatment group. Across multiple quantitative and qualitative belief measures, women generally feel more strongly about income and wealth inequalities and about public policies aimed at inequality reduction than men do. Interesting differences are also documented across political, racial, and other spectra."
