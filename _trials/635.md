abstract: "We partner with an Islamic bank in Indonesia which sends text messages to its customers who are late on their credit card debt repayment. We randomize the content of the text messages across customers: some receive simple reminders; some receive information about the financial consequences of being late on debt repayment; others receive information about the religious doctrine on being late on debt repayment. The purpose of the texts is to encourage repayment by reminding borrowers that they are late on their credit card repayments, or by leveraging extrinsic motivation (informing them about about the financial consequences of non-repayment) or intrinsic motivation (informing them about about the religious consequences of non-repayment). 
We test - if our texts influence repayment of the customers, and - whether the mechanism behind the effect is a change in beliefs about the consequences of delaying payment. We also test- whether this effects depends on the religiosity and the trust in institutions of the customers and the environment in which they live and - if intrinsic motivation for repaying debt can be crowded out by financial incentives. 
Finally the bank offers restructuring offers to some customers, and complement our analysis on willingness to pay with a test of the effectiveness of changing customers ability to pay. Using the take-up of restructuring offers we also plan to estimate the monetary value of religious and non-religious reminders about credit card repayment."
