abstract: "Research on understanding the factors and decision processes that influence men and women to pursue an entrepreneurial career has gained momentum during the past years. We investigate in how far exposure to real-life entrepreneurial role models as one educational variable in a German university entrepreneurship course has an effect on the entrepreneurial intentions, attitudes and entrepreneurial self-efficacy of students. Over a period of two years, we conduct a randomized field experiment within a full-semester, mandatory entrepreneurship course for undergraduate students at a large German university. Our sample comprises approximately (status March 2018) 1678 students that work in 337 teams of four to five. Each team collaborates with one of 175 participating business founders, of which 52 are female. 
We define seven outcome variables to test in how far the interaction with a (same-gender) business founder influences student's development over time: (1) entrepreneurial intentions, (2) attitudes towards entrepreneurship, as well as (3) creative problem solving, (4) marshalling of resources, (5) implementing,  (6) managing ambiguity, and (7) financial knowledge as five indicators that represent entrepreneurial self-efficacy. The combination of a mandatory entrepreneurship course, random assignment of students to teams and entrepreneurs, as well as a pre-test/post-test design, allows us to draw robust causal inferences about the impact of female entrepreneurial role models. We find that exposure to female entrepreneurs particularly boosts the development of entrepreneurial self-efficacy and attitudes towards entrepreneurship of female students. "
