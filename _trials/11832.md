abstract: "Abstract
WFP Peru aims to provide cash assistance to vulnerable in-transit migrants and refugees from Venezuela, so that they are able to meet their essential food and nutrition needs.

Transfers are worth a total of approx. 357 USD (for a household with a maximum of 5 members) and will reach around 16,500 migrants across 5 districts of Peru. The programme will be implemented from April to October-November 2024. The total transfer size is held constant between the two groups. The impact evaluation will be carried out in 2 of these locations: Arequipa and Desaguadero-Puno.

Given that the modality of cash transfers can influence decision-making patterns (including consumption behavior), this impact evaluation will compare the effects of (a) receiving a restricted cash cash (in the form of a Sodexo card, or similar provider) versus (b) receiving a less-restricted pre-loaded debit card (Zinli card, or similar provider) on in-transit migrants and refugees' spending behavior as well as food security and psychosocial well-being, among other indicators. Primary evaluation questions focus on the impact of different CBT modalities on consumption behavior, food security, and other measures of wellbeing, while secondary questions explore migrants' intentions, expectations, and knowledge, as well as their coping mechanisms and psychosocial well-being during their journey."
