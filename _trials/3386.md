abstract: "The incidence of workplace injury is high in manufacturing in developing countries. In this project, we focus on the impact of intensive training and information on decent work environment among workers and firms. We partner with BRAC, which also collaborates with different trade associations, to understand and evaluate the workplace safety and awareness in the light engineering (LE) sector in Bangladesh.  In order to understand the causal effects of information and training on the health and safety at the firm level, we randomly assign firms in LE sectors into two treatment arms: T1: Managers/owners of firms receive intensive training on occupational health and safety (OHS). T2: OHS + business training and financial linkages, C: the firms in the control group receive no training. We examine a range of outcomes related to workersâ€™ safety and health issues, working environment and safety standards of firm, cost, business growth, investment and profitability."
