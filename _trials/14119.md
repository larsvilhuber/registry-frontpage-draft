abstract: "Fewer than 1/3 of firms in sub-Saharan Africa have access to reliable electricity, creating substantial private and social costs.
Clean power generation from low emission technologies present an opportunity to preserve the benefits from increased access to reliable energy and the resultant growth, whilst minimizing the associated environmental costs.
We partner with a Sierra Leonese off-grid distributor, EasySolar, to test demand for 2kW, 2kWh battery, solar generators among SMEs (small and medium enterprises) in the Freetown area using a Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) mechanism. Specifically, we test the impact of providing firms with a line of credit on demand for these generators."
