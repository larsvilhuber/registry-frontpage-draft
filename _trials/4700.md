abstract: "This trial evaluated Gram Varta, a program that aimed to improve critical indicators of health, nutrition, water, sanitation, and hygiene (HNWASH) by changing relevant attitudes and behaviors in communities. Gram Varta used the participatory learning and action (PLA) approach and worked with women’s self-help groups (SHGs) as agents of change. The impact evaluation of Gram Varta addressed the question whether PLA programs can be brought to scale in the Indian setting. For this purpose, the program roll-out in Madhepura district of Bihar was embedded in a randomized controlled trial with a subsequent phase-in. Between June 2015 and September 2016, PLA meetings took place in SHGs in villages allocated to the treatment group. 90 villages received the intervention, 90 villages were in the control group. Data was collected before the intervention and about two months after the last PLA meeting. The impact on several health-related indicators as well as on women’s agency was analyzed.  "
