abstract: "The intervention consists of Implicit Bias Training (IBT) designed specifically for primary school teachers. The training builds on rich evidence from an ever-growing interdisciplinary literature and has been fine-tuned to the primary school setting via three pilot studies in both the UK and Italy. Our theory of change is that making teachers aware of the existence and pervasiveness of implicit bias and suggesting concrete actions to counter it (targeting classroom environments, modes of communication and feedback, and teaching implicit Bias (IB) to children) can improve teacher practices, learning environments, and, in the long run, pupils’ outcomes. The training will be conducted in small groups of 4th and 5th grade teachers in Italian Elementary Schools, and consists of nine sessions (three in-person and six online). The randomized controlled trial (RCT) will take place in the Italian regions of Piemonte and Campania, with randomization occurring at the school-building level (‘plesso’). All teachers enrolled in the trial within a participating ‘plesso’ will be randomly assigned to either the treatment group, receiving the training, or the control group, who will only answer the questionnaires."
