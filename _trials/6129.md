abstract: "Conduct an online survey through Mturk. The objective is to evaluate  the  ability  of  religious  figures  to  sway opinions on a topic that may not be explicitly religious in nature (i.e.  the environment).  I will further attempt to identify heterogeneous *treatment* effects by religiosity.

Participants answer very basic demographic questions and are then randomised into 4 treatment arms. Stratification will be by religiosity as answered in the first section. Participants will be shown a quote from a religious figure with attribution, or without attribution but juxtaposed to different figures. The control group will receive a quote from a religious leader but placed as the opinion of generic world leaders.

Individuals will be paid a lump sum for participating and also entered into a prize draw of $100 (or equivalent in Euros). They will be asked how much of their potential winnings they would like to donate to a national environmental charity. This is the question I hope to elicit preferences from in a non-hypothetical scenario.

The overarching hypothesis this experiment hopes to address is: Do religious figures have an impact on views on non-religious topics, and how does this impact vary by religiosity? A secondary motivation is searching for heterogeneity by religion.
