abstract: "Across most developed countries, wealth inequality is on the rise. While inheritance is related to this gap in wealth, inheritance taxation remains unpopular with the public. In this trial, we investigate the mechanisms that drive public opinion for inheritance taxes. Specifically, we examine how self-interest or perceptions of inherited wealth shift public preferences. To examine our research question, we designed a survey experiment where randomly selected subgroups of the German population receive an information treatment, relative to inheritance taxes, to update their knowledge and subsequent preferences for policy changes. To this end, we developed three information treatments. The first information treatment informs respondents about the size of the tax allowance for inheritances in Germany. The second information treatment informs respondents about the share of inherited wealth in Germany and its increase in the last 50 years. The third information treatment is a combination of the two. Using an instrumental variable approach, we will evaluate the impact of these different information treatments in order to assess changes in public opinions on abolishing or increasing the inheritance tax. The goal of our survey experiment is to examine if learning about current inheritance allowances or the persistence of wealth across generations drives public opinion on inheritance tax policy changes."
