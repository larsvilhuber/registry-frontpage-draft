abstract: "Freedom of expression is the foundation of any free, democratic, and civic society. The right to speak your mind freely on important social issues and to access uncensored information plays a vital role in the healthy development process of any society, as well as the well-being of each individual citizens in such society. However, as of 2014, only 14% of the world’s population enjoys media free from censorship. While billions of people face daily distortions of their information, we know very little regarding the impact of media censorship on these individuals, both in theory and in empirics. In this project, we aim to use a field experiment to study the consequences of media censorship in China, home to the world’s most prevalent censorship apparatus.

In particular, we plan to use rigorous quantitative analysis to answer following questions: (i) What is the impact of media censorship, on citizens’ beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors (across political, economic, and social domains)? (ii) Why is media censorship effective, especially in the age of increasing connectedness of global information? Is the effect purely supply driven? Is the effect sustained by dampened demand in uncensored information? (iii) What does it take to undo the impact of censorship? In particular, how do people learn things that they do not know they do not know, or that they do not know they have been exposed to censored sources before?"
