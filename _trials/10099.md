abstract: "In this experiment (targeted sample size = 1500 households), we ask whether electric cooking can be a credible alternative to charcoal cooking in the context of a low-income country, study the impact on charcoal demand, consumption patterns and the formation of pro-social motivations. Specifically, we randomly distribute electric pressure cookers to households connected to a reliable and green electricity grid  in Goma in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo where over 90% of the population relies on charcoal as their primary energy fuel. The majority of this charcoal is illegally produced in protected forests and is a key income source for several armed groups . We design different treatment arms to improve adoption of cookers, leveraging both selfish and pro-social preferences of households."
