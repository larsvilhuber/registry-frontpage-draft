abstract: "Intra-state civil conflicts have replaced inter-state ones as the dominant forms of organized violence that shape our world. Civil conflicts are humanitarian disasters. They kill and injure millions of people, and leave many more destitute. In their detailed review on civil conflict literature, Blattman and Miguel (2010) argue existing studies on civil conflict only scratch the surface of the range of possible impacts on the economy and society, and we are still far from a complete understanding of the true extent of the damages civil conflicts inflict upon host societies. In this project we aim to contribute to that crucial understanding in very significant and important ways by focusing on how exposure to civil conflict violence impacts upon social preferences of individuals. 

Civil conflicts expose individuals to gruesome violence either as witnesses, victims or perpetrators. Armed conflict environments create an acceptable climate for violence, reduce individualsâ€™ inhibitions against violent acts, and lead to the normalization of violence in everyday life. It is very likely that such experiences affect people psychologically, and that these effects manifest themselves in different ways in interpersonal relations, and in economic and political life even long after the conflict is over. Nevertheless, there exist few studies analyzing individual level data on actual exposure to political violence in a civil conflict context to decipher the effects on behavior. This gap in the literature is mainly due to two major difficulties. The first difficulty stems from the problem of endogeneity. Individuals that are exposed to more violence may be the ones who choose to stay in the conflict area or even the ones who choose to take up arms and fight on the frontline in a civil conflict situation. The second difficulty is the scarcity of micro survey data from contemporary conflict and post-conflict societies. Conflict areas can be extremely dangerous places for researchers to conduct field work.

Our project overcomes these main difficulties. First, we discovered a novel way of identifying exogenous variation of exposure to violence. Our project will conduct a large scale survey and collect several measures of exposure to violence (including binary and continuous measures) in addition to many other important information on individuals. (Due to the sensitive nature of our project, until the project is completed, we will not disclose further information regarding our measures of violence exposure). Second, our survey will incorporate an incentivized field experiment on social preferences. We will first study whether exposure to violence is associated with social preferences. Also while half of individuals in our sample will decide how much to give to a poor family that lives in a non-conflict region, the other half will decide how much to give to a poor family that lives in a conflict region. Third, we are able to study distributional preferences of individuals by varying the price of giving and classifying individuals into different groups such as selfish, fair and efficiency oriented.
