abstract: "Incentives in complex jobs — like education and health— have had mixed results in developed countries. Both these jobs have complex production functions. One way to describe job production complexity is by allowing agents to have uncertainty about how their inputs translate into productivity. When coupled with large output incentives, such uncertainty can induce agents to inefficiently shift their effort allocation to inputs with lower uncertainty, even at the cost of reducing average output. This experiment tests that hypothesis using a two-input real effort lab experiment. Participants are paid based on the number of easy and hard math questions they answer correctly. In treatment, I increase the uncertainty about the marginal payoff for inputs. The experiment is intended to test whether increased marginal uncertainty induces  agents to inefficiently switch their effort allocation."
