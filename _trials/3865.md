abstract: "Does reframing large debt burdens into smaller goals increase debt repayment? We are working with a large not-for-profit credit counseling agency to examine whether reframing debt payments into subgoals can improve debt repayment behavior. Randomly selected participants in the credit counseling agency's debt management plan (DMP) will receive communications that frame their debt burdens as small, steadily increasing subgoals, of which the majority can be successfully completed in the first year of the plan. We plan to evaluate the impacts of reframing on DMP retention and debt reduction."
