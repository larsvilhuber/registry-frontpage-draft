abstract: "Researchers must often choose whether to communicate using numbers or language when sharing information with policymakers. While there are many reasons why experts would send messages using language or numbers, our study emphasizes the role of message precision: numbers represent precise estimates, whereas language is imprecise because one word can be interpreted as many numerical values. We run an experiment in which we recruit academic researchers and vary their incentives to directionally persuade or to convey accurate information to a sample of policymakers that we recruit. We analyze how researchers choose between message formats, testing whether directional incentives increase their likelihood of using language to communicate as compared to using numeric estimates, and explore these effects on policymakers.
