abstract: "Play supports imagination, creativity, problem-solving, perspective-taking, emotion regulation, the development of executive functions, and these are needed for success in school (National Research Council and Institute of Medicine, 2000). Specifically, imaginative play develops very young children capacity to engage in abstraction, which is necessary for learning of concepts and to self-regulate (ability to focus on school learning) (Fleer, 2010). The proposed project will examine a low-cost play-based early childhood care and education in two sub-Saharan countries in Africa: Tanzania and Uganda. The study will evaluate childrenâ€™s cognitive, language, social and emotional development and school readiness of an innovative play-based early childhood program being implemented by BRAC with support from Lego Foundation."
