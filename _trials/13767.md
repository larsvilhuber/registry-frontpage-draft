abstract: "This study explores higher order risk preferences (prudence, temperance) for lottery choices that affect one-self vs. other people. We elicit risk preferences (risk aversion, prudence, temperance) from a laboratory experiment with undergraduate students using the risk apportionment tasks of Deck et al. (2023) and vary within subjects whether the decision concerns oneself or some other person. We vary on a between-subjects basis social distance by having the decision for other being implemented to a close friend or to someone else within the group of subjects in a session. We take care that a group of subjects within a session is sufficiently mixed from the student population in order to ensure a greater social distance.
