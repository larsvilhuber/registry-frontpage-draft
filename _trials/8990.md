abstract: "We will administer incentivized, on-platform surveys in 15 countries using the double-bounded dichotomous choice (DBDC) method to elicit users’ valuation for Facebook. We will also elicit users’ hypothetical valuation of Instagram and Whatsapp using the single-bounded dichotomous choice (SBDC) method. In both DBDC and SBDC valuations, we will randomly vary offer values across users. Finally, we will also elicit users’ hypothetical valuations for other digital goods using the best-worst scaling (BWS) method where the options presented to users will vary randomly. We will run these surveys on the Facebook platform. We will estimate the median valuation of users for each app in each country. "
