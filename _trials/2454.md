abstract: "We implement a pilot teacher-coaching program in the state of Sonora, in Mexico. The program will be  implemented with lower secondary teachers teaching 9th grade mathematics in  67 of the state's general and technical secondary schools. Each coach works with approximately 5 teachers meeting regularly both in person and virtually for approximately six months. We will collect data on program implementation through survey and interview of program participants (teachers and coaches). Classroom practice will be measured using the CLASS observation rubric. In addition, we will administer pre- and post-tests of general skills, as well as survey students for engagement and perceptions of teaching quality. "
