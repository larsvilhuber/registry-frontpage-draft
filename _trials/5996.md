abstract: "We analyze the impact of counterfactual thinking on the risk management decisions of players of a mobile game. In our experiment, individuals engage in risky lotteries that can lead to losses of their in-game wealth. To prevent a loss, individuals can purchase insurance coverage. It is well known that individuals adapt their behavior following a factual outcome (e.g., individuals exert a higher level of risk aversion after a loss). However, it is less known how individuals react to receiving the information of how close they were to avoiding or suffering a loss. We additionally examine whether counterfactual information affect the self-reported satisfaction of the preceding period’s insurance demand. The field experiment is incentive compatible and allows for tests against the null hypothesis that counterfactual thinking does not affect risk taking behavior."
