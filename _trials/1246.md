abstract: "Hogares Infantiles (HIs) are nurseries run by the Colombian government, Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar (ICBF), providing partly subsided day care and 60% of daily nutritional requirement to children from low socio-economic backgrounds. Parents pay US$10-25 per month. HIs, of which there are 1,008 across Colombia, are community-based, in the sense that they are typically located in fairly well-equipped community centres and are run by the local parents’ association. They employ between 3 and 6 teachers with some training in early education, each caring for about 30 children aged 2-5 years. Some centres also enrol children below 2 years.
An important component of the new government’s Early Childhood policy is the quality enhancement of HIs. This study analyses the effects of quality upgrades provided by the government and a private NGO in services provided by His on children’s development. The upgrade entails:
• hiring additional and better qualified personnel (one health professional and one professional in socio-emotional development per every 200 children, and one paraprofessional pedagogical assistant per every 50 children. ICBF provides an additional US$20 per child per month to HI to hire the new staff, establishing  Hogares Infantiles Mejorado (henceforth, HIM)
In addition, a private foundation, Fundación Éxito (FE), provides extra modules (HIM+FE henceforth), at US$40 per child per month, including:
• pedagogical training of teachers and a reading programme of for teachers
• a modified version of the nutritional component (more proteins and vitamins) along with information on nutrition and food preparation.
We evaluated both interventions to identify their impacts as compared to HIs on:
• children’s nutritional status and development (physical, cognitive and socio-emotional)
We exploited the 18-month expansion phase of the program to design a rigorous evaluation, sampling 120 of the HIs to be upgraded. We randomly assigned them to 3 groups:
• controls, switching to the HIM model at the end of the expansion period
• HI, switching to HIM immediately
• HI, switching to HIM+FE immediately.
Our data will includes:
• a baseline survey of 1,987 children aged 18-36 months and their families.
• a follow-up survey of the same children and their families
• nursery and teacher surveys
We have also investigated the mechanisms yielding the estimated impacts and whether the extra costs involved in HIM and HIM+FE are justified.
