abstract: "Negotiation scholars agree on the following recommendation: avoid (hard) ultimatums and do not leave your opponent without any options. Using online experiments on Prolific, we will investigate the effect of the availability of soft ultimatums (ultimatum offers that specify a range of amounts – instead of a specific number – that the proposer is willing to give to the responder) on offers made, the likelihood of acceptance, and responders’ satisfaction and fairness perceptions of the negotiated outcome. There are two agents: a proposer and a responder. In the control treatment, they play the standard ultimatum game, where the proposer offers an amount of the given pie, and the responder accepts or rejects. In the experimental treatment, proposer can —at his/her will— specify a minimum amount and a maximum amount s/he would be willing to give to the responder. We are interested in the following markers: (i) how frequently is this option used, (ii) does the availability of this option influence the offers made by proposers (e.g., how do the maximum offers in the experimental treatment compare with the offers in the control treatment), (iii) how does the rejection rate for maximum offers in the experimental treatment compare to the rejection rate of equivalent offers in the control treatment, and (iv) how do the satisfaction and fairness perceptions of responders in the experimental treatment compare with those in the control treatment (for comparable offers)?
