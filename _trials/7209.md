abstract: "The aim of this research is to reduce studentsâ€™ mobile phone screen time and simultaneously increase their physical activity level by providing targets and incentives for a 21-day period. Specifically, we will investigate whether reducing an unwanted behavior such as excessive mobile usage and substituting the gained time with a positive alternative behavior (e.g., walking) is more effective than encouraging a screen time reduction in insolation without a positive substitute behavior. We also investigate consequences of reducing screen time and increasing physical activity on wellbeing and performance measures, such as GPA. "
