abstract: "School connectedness is commonly defined as an academic environment in which students believe that adults and peers in the school care about them as individuals. School connectedness is a known protective factor against risky health behaviours and adverse mental health outcomes and is a driver of students’ academic performance. School connectedness is also a key factor that influences students’ prosocial behaviours and the development of their social skills. Previous research conducted in schools in Nyarugusu refugee camp has revealed that teachers report high levels of empathy towards their students and interest in their ideas and perspectives; however, student do not appear to know or perceive such interest and attention. We will assess whether a brief messaging intervention aimed at fixing this gap in perceptions between students and teachers affects student's pro-social behaviours and attitudes. "
