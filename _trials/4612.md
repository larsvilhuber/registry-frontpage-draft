abstract: "Educators around the globe often require students to commit to academic integrity by signing a no-cheating declaration. This paper evaluates how such no-cheating declarations affect academic cheating. Exploiting data from a field experiment with undergraduate students, we identify cheating by comparing the similarity in multiple-choice answers of seat neighbors and counterfactual neighbors. Our main finding is that students plagiarize more after having signed a no-cheating declaration. This effect is driven by students of below-average ability. Regarding channels, we find evidence suggesting that requesting a commitment to a no-cheating rule weakens the social norm of academic integrity and triggers psychological reactance."
