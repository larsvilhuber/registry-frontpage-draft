abstract: "The use of electoral fraud as a tool for securing victory in elections is well-documented. However, its use for purposes that go beyond winning an election remains relatively understudied. Particularly puzzling is its prevalence in the context of elections in non-democracies, where electoral results are often manipulated despite the incumbent's guaranteed success. Why do autocratic leaders engage in fraud when victory is assured? In this project, I study improving perceived legitimacy as one of the reasons for engaging in fraud. I examine the following mechanism: if turnout influences the population's perception of the autocrat's legitimacy, then he might want to employ fraud to achieve a desired turnout value. I will call this the legitimacy hypothesis. First, by leveraging data from the 2016-2021 Russian parliamentary elections, I confirm the presence of electoral fraud. I focus on manipulations of turnout values and perform several statistical tests to detect those, including last digit distribution and the excess integer values test. After gathering suggestive evidence of the use of fraud to influence turnout, I proceed with testing whether knowledge of turnout actually affects perceived legitimacy. To answer this question, I propose undertaking a survey with a representative sample of the Russian voter population. The key component of the survey will involve a randomized information intervention where treated respondents receive information about outcomes of a hypothetical election. Subsequently, their evaluation of legitimacy will be measured."
