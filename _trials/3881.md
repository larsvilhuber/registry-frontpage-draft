abstract: "Many economic and political settings involve multilateral bargaining scenarios. Potential gender differences in these scenarios may shed light on the gender gap in labor market outcomes as well as political representation. In a laboratory experiment, we exogenously manipulate the gender composition of the group to test, whether gender differences do appear in a simple three player bargaining game. We study an unstructured bargaining protocol under a majority voting rule to understand, who initiates the bargaining process and what coalitions are formed to arrive at an agreement. We measure the efficiency and equality of the bargaining outcomes to evaluate group and individual performance across treatments."
