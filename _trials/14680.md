abstract: "This project evaluates the effectiveness of the Show Up to Grow Up program (SUGU). SUGU is a 5-month behaviorally informed texting intervention addressed to parents of preschool children with the goal of on reducing absenteeism. We will carry out a randomized controlled trial with approximately 1400 parents from different preschools, where half of the parents will be assigned to the treatment group who will receive the SUGU program, and the other half will be in the control (business as usual) group. We test the effectiveness of the program by evaluating its impact on the number of days a child was absent from preschool and the probability of being chronically absent."
