abstract: "This paper studies the effects of relative performance feedback on physical activity in a field experiment. Previous relative performance feedback interventions show highly heterogeneous effects. We first aim to clarify which individuals benefit and which may suffer from relative performance feedback using a highly diverse subject pool for which we have a large amount of individual data. Previous findings suggest that participants increase performance if they receive above average feedback. Therefore, we test a variant (treatment PRPF) in which we tell each subject the best rank they achieved during the observation period. This variant thus contains the most positive feedback that can be given to a person without lying. It can also be interpreted as showing the subject what abilities they have.   
We compare this variant with the one in which the most frequently occupied rank is communicated to the subject as his rank (treatment RPF), and with a control group without feedback (treatment control).

Since evidence on the driving forces behind the mechanisms is still scarce, we also want to reveal the underlying behavioral mechanisms behind performance changes after relative performance feedback. To do this, we not only systematically vary the rule by which the communicated rank is selected, but we also vary whether the rule is communicated to subjects. Thus, we compare treatments RPF/PRPF with RPFno/PRPFno (with _no indicating that the rule is not disclosed).

Additionally, we test how performance after RPF changes if the comparison group is systematically varied. Previous findings suggest that the choice of a suitable comparison group. In half of the feedbacks, the comparison group is the entire study group (with subjects aged 18-74), called RPF_all/PRPF_all, and in the other half, each subject is compared to the 50 subjects most similar to their own age (RPF_age/PRPF_age). We expect more significant differences when subjects get feedback in relation to more similar peers.

We run the experiment within an ongoing, 365-day long study with about 900 participants who all aim at improving their physical activity. All those subjects have been positively health screened, are using a smartphone app (ActiVAtE Behavior) to transmit their steps (main performance measure) in a timely manner and have provided extensive individual survey data including socio-demographics, body measures, health goals, motivation, etc.. Furthermore, we have gathered their economic preferences (e.g. competitiveness, social preferences, risk preferences, cheating) using survey-based, incentivized experimental games (e.g. Ultimatum Game, Public Goods Games, Holt-Laury-Lottery, Dictator Game, Coin Toss Game). Besides, we use an incentivized belief elicitation about their previous relative performance. Most of the participants are also equipped with a fitness tracker (medisana ViFit Run) to collect data without carrying their smartphones. The consent forms and data protection concept have been approved by the University of Vechta’s data protection officer. Since participants have been recruited via television and radio within a region with about 1 million inhabitants and there was never an in-person individual or group meeting, people usually do not know each other.
