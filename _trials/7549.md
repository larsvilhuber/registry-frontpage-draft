abstract: "This experiment investigates the role of magical thinking in binary dictator games. In a 2x2 treatment design, subjects are randomly allocated across two treatment dimensions: Certainty and Time. The Certainty dimensions varies whether subjects are matched in traditional giver-receiver pairs (Role Certainty) or whether they are matched into pairs in which both subjects make dictator decisions and it is randomly determined which decision is actually implemented (Role Uncertainty). The Time dimension varies whether the subject participates before or after his or her opponent (the second-mover receives no information about the first-mover's choices)."
