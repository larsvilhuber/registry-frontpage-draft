abstract: "In Germany, the influx of refugees since spring 2015 has caused both an immigration-friendly culture of hospitality and growing animosity and anxiety towards refugees. The latter becomes evident in the increasing amount of attacks against refugees’ residences and a steeply rising support for right-wing political parties.  This study seeks to investigate whether a voluntary contact with refugees via a “blind dinner” affects German citizens’ prejudice and their intention to discriminate against refugees. "
