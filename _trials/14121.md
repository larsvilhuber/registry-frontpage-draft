abstract: "Background: Aggressive behaviour is a significant concern among children that is a potential ramification for wellbeing in terms of social interaction and academic performance. Virtual Reality (VR) is considered a novel and immersive platform for young children's engagement and controlling environment for skill development compared to traditional therapeutic intervention. The present study aims to investigate the effectiveness of VR-based intervention designed to reduce aggression among children in comparison to Treatment-As-Usual (TAU). 
Methods: A randomized Controlled Trial will be conducted with 128 children aged 8-11 years with aggression. Participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention group (N=64) and Treatment-As-Usual (TAU) (N=64). The VR-based Intervention involved immersive scenarios to improve children's emotional regulation and social interaction skills.
Results: Outcomes will be measured using behavioural assessments, self-reports and baseline data (mid-treatment and post-treatment). The treatment group will show a statistically significant reduction in aggression among children.
Conclusion: The findings of the study suggest that incorporating VR into therapeutic practices could offer a promising alternative to existing treatment for managing aggression in children.
