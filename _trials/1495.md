abstract: "We test whether matching frictions, due to search costs and asymmetric information, reduce youth employment in the labour market. To do this we organised large job fairs where workers and firms meet with minimal search costs, and randomly invited  job-seekers and firms drawn from samples representative of the labour market in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The firms were surveyed at a baseline and endline survey on either side of the job fairs, with midline data collection of firm hiring behaviour before and after the job fairs. This pre-analysis plan outlines how we will analyse the firm data to study the impact of attending the job fairs. "
