abstract: "Unregistered work harms society and exposes individuals to exploitative work conditions. Due to its illegal nature, however, its size and determinants are difficult to study. In this project, we aim to identify the share of residents in Germany that worked without registration at least once in 2021. We implement a double list experiment in three different samples of the German population: Natives, migrants, and refugees. The implementation of a list experiment in these different samples allows us to compare the occurrence of informal employment across parts of the German population that differ in their demographics, socio-economic backgrounds, and labor market experiences. The list experiment also gives us the opportunity to identify population characteristics that are associated with unregistered work. The results will provide important insights into the mechanics of unregistered work and valuable starting points for a refined discussion of policy measures to combat this phenomenon. "
