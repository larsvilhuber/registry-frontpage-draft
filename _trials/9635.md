abstract: "In this project, we analyze how the experience of success or failure in a high stakes environment influences beliefs and perceptions. Using the central application procedure for places in the medical fields in Germany, we study how the (non-)assigment of a study place through this procedure influences perceived procedural efficiency. We attempt to follow two identification strategies. Our first identification strategy relies on a regression discontinuity design that uses application scores in the three admission quotas as running variable and incentivized survey measures administered after applicants are informed about the outcome of their application as outcomes. Our second identification strategy relies on a difference-in-differences analysis of incentivized survey measures administered before and after applicants are informed.
