abstract: "We study whether individuals engage in more moral behaviors when faced with uncertain outcomes. This hypothesis comes from a popular magical belief that moral behaviors lead to good luck under uncertainty. We conduct two online experiments in which we manipulate the level of uncertainty associated with potential payoffs and observe participantsâ€™ choices in a subsequent moral decision. In the first experiment, the moral decision is the same as the decision which determines the uncertain payoff. While this experiment induces the magical belief to the greatest extent, it suffers from confounder such as regret aversion. In the second experiment, we relax the direct connection by separating the moral decision and the decision that determines the uncertainty payoff to explore whether people's moral behaviors are still influenced by uncertainty.
