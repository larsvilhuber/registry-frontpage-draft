abstract: "In 2021, a carbon price was implemented in Germany, targeting emissions in the building and transport sectors to encourage the adoption of low-carbon alternatives. The German government announced using revenues to compensate households via a climate rebate. Previous research suggests that knowledge about financial implications from and acceptance of carbon pricing and rebate schemes remain limited among the general public. In this project, we investigate whether policy acceptance can be improved by providing personalized information regarding costs or rebate amounts.

We conduct a survey experiment with a representative sample of the German population. We randomly assign participants to variants of our experiment that provide them with personalized information either regarding their households’ costs from carbon pricing or rebate amounts. 
In the first experiment, we start by eliciting participants’ acceptance of carbon pricing. Next, we ask participants to state their household's additional annual costs for a given carbon price as well as their uncertainty regarding their estimation. A randomly selected treatment group receives quantitative information on their household’s actual costs from carbon pricing, calculated based on previously stated vehicle and energy usage. The remaining participants act as a control group with no further information. The experiment concludes by eliciting all participants’ posterior acceptance of carbon pricing. 

Our second experiment starts by providing participants with the personalized cost information when inquiring about their prior acceptance of carbon pricing. Next, we suggest a lump-sum climate rebate of total revenues from carbon pricing, asking participants to state the expected annual payout to their household and their level of uncertainty regarding this estimation. Afterward, participants are randomly selected to receive information on the actual rebate amount for their household given this policy design. The control group receives no additional information. Again, we conclude by eliciting all participants' posterior acceptance of carbon pricing.

We conduct both experiments for the current price of 45€/t CO2 and a projected price of 200€/t CO2 in 2027. Our experiment is followed by additional questions on participants' trust in the government's climate policy decisions and their preferences regarding revenue use of the carbon price. 

Our experimental design allows us to identify the causal effect of personalized information provision regarding costs and rebate amounts on policy acceptance of carbon pricing and to investigate how respondents differentially incorporate quantitative information based on their initial misperceptions and uncertainty.
