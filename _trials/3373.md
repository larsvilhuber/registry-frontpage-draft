abstract: "This project examines whether individuals form self-serving beliefs about the causes underlying inequality. Because such causes are often difficult to assess, people may evaluate them in a manner that justifies supporting redistributive policies that benefit them most. To address this question, I will conduct a laboratory experiment to test for evidence of such belief manipulation, both by directly measuring beliefs and manipulating how they are formed. I will also measure preferences over redistributive policies, as a way of establishing that these are influenced by the elicited beliefs."
