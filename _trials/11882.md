abstract: "Non-price interventions, “nudges”, are frequently used to affect individual choices without limiting their set of choices. Significant research in the field has shown that nudges are effective inducing a decrease on residential energy consumption. However, most studies focus on the impact of nudges on residential consumers while the impact on prosumers remains relatively understudied. Focusing on prosumers is of great importance for two main reasons. First, the number of households that adopt solar panels significantly increases over the years and second, several studies indicate a solar rebound effect in the electricity consumption. In this study, we estimate the effect of social-norm comparisons by implementing a RCT with an energy service company in Sweden, which offers metering, and IT systems for energy efficiency and renewable energy.
