abstract: "Large-scale assessments have allowed policy-makers, researchers, and the general public to compare learning outcomes across (national and sub-national) school systems and over time. This study examines whether they can achieve another equally-important goal: to provide useful information to improve school management and/or classroom instruction. We present experimental evidence on the impact of the use of large-scale assessments for diagnostic feedback and capacity-building. We randomly assigned 105 public primary schools in the province of La Rioja, Argentina to: (a) a diagnostic feedback group in which we administered standardized tests in math and Spanish at baseline and two follow-ups and made their results available to the schools through user-friendly reports; (b) a capacity-building group in which we did the same and also provided schools with professional development workshops for supervisors, principals, and teachers; or (c) a control group, in which we administered standardized tests only at the second follow-up."
