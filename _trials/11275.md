abstract: "Previous studies have documented the primacy of partisan affective polarisation over other social cleavages (i.e. race, religion or ethnic identities) in western democracies. Partisan affective polarisation is understood as a form of hostility and prejudice that operates across political lines. It involves interpersonal evaluations and behaviours towards other individuals based on their political affiliation, and may result in social, political and economic discrimination. The question is why are people more polarised by partisanship than their regional, linguistic, ethnic or religious affiliations? An increasingly common answer is that interactions across race, religion, gender and other social divides are constrained by social norms, but there are no corresponding pressures or sanctions that prevent discrimination and hostility towards political opponents.
Here, we present a research design to test the presence of norms on political discrimination. The design involves laboratory experiments investigating the relationship between discriminatory behaviour and the perceived social inappropriateness of discrimination. Our hypothesis is that participants will perceive it to be more socially inappropriate to discriminate on the basis of religion than on the basis of political identities."
