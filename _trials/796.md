abstract: "This document describes the analysis plan for a randomized experiment examining the psychological effects of poverty on cognitive function. We will recruit 2000 respondents from Amazon Mechanical Turk and expose our treatment group to a prime that triggers feelings of poverty (Mani et al., 2013). Then, participants complete ten Raven progressive matrices and 75 items of a Stroop task. The design of the study is a replication of the study by  (Mani et al., 2013). This plan outlines the design of the experiments, the outcomes of interest, the econometric approach and the dimensions of heterogeneity we intend to explore.
