abstract: "This documents outlines the study design and statistical analysis of our evaluation of a guaranteed job program that will be piloted in the municipality of Gramatneusiedl in Austria, starting in October 2020.
Our study design is based on two approaches.
The first approach uses individual-level pairwise randomization of participants into waves.
The second approach constructs a synthetic control at the municipality level, to impute counterfactual outcomes for Gramatneusiedl.
We consider multiple different treatment contrasts to separate out direct effects of program participation, anticipation effects of future participation, and municipal level equilibrium effects."
