abstract: "Over 250 million children worldwide under the age of 5 years are at risk of not achieving their developmental potential due to poverty, poor health and nutrition, and deficient care and stimulation. Many early childhood care and education (ECCE) programs have been shown to be effective at improving child development in small efficacy trials, but few have been evaluated once taken to scale. This study is the evaluation of a promising ECCE intervention developed by the International NGO Lively Minds and now adopted and taken to scale by the Government of Ghana. The intervention was previously evaluated by the same research team (AEARCTR-0002777). Using a cluster randomized control trial design â€“ implemented by randomizing the order in which districts enter the program - we will estimate the causal effects on child cognition, socio-emotional skills and health.
