abstract: "Burkina Faso’s population and especially the workforce is rapidly growing. Although unemployment is low (0.6 percent), about 70 percent of Burkinabè work in low-productive agricultural activities. A key challenge for policymakers is to find effective interventions that create productive jobs for the youth. This research project seeks to provide rigorous evidence on the impacts of two private sector-based interventions – matching and cash grants – on the performance and employment by firms in agricultural value chains. These interventions provide alternative mechanisms of support to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) located in a special agri-business development zone in rural Burkina Faso. The study makes use of a randomized controlled trial (RCT). It is embedded into the Bagré Growth Pole Project supported by the World Bank since 2011. The Government through the Maison de l’Entreprise du Burkina Faso (MEBF) implements it. The MEBF is a business association anchored in the Chamber of Commerce. The research hypothesis is that both interventions improve business outcomes, but cash grants are more effective than matching grants due to differences in their conditions of usage. Hence, the main questions are: (i) what is the impact of matching and cash grants on management skills, business practices, business development, turnover, profits, investment, firm survival and employment in beneficiary firms? (ii) how do both interventions compare along the different outcomes of interest and which of the two interventions is more cost-effective? (iii) do the interventions generate any positive externalities on other firms located in the Bagré Growth Pole area?"
