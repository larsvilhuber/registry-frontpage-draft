abstract: "In a collaborative, innovative project, do licensing terms that govern use of project output affect the team's effort and project success? This research seeks to provide experimental evidence on this question, in the important case of open-source software development. We propose a randomized field experiment on a popular code hosting platform. We create exogenous variation in licensing terms of projects through preference shifts of project owners, which we induce through suggestions and selective information provision. We measure the causal effect of license adoption on metrics for team size, team effort as well as product quality"
