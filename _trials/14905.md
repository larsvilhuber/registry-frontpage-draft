abstract: "Recent empirical studies have shown differences in the punishment and rewarding of men and women following uncertain outcomes that are due to both luck and the agent’s actions. Many studies have shown that men tend to be rewarded following unexpected good outcomes while women tend to be punished more frequently following unexpected bad outcomes. It is unclear whether these gender differences are due to a difference in how male versus female agents' outcomes are attributed to their actions (outcome bias) or whether they simply stem from a difference in a desire to punish/reward male versus female agents. We build on this literature by designing an experimental study to disentangle these competing mechanisms. We ask whether gender differences in rewards/punishments are due to differences in outcome bias depending on agent gender or differences in punishment preferences dependent on the agent’s gender. "
