abstract: "Social secrecy refers to votersâ€™ beliefs as to whether they will reveal their vote choice to anyone (be it friends, family, or strangers). Despite the fact that social secrecy theoretically alters the costs associated with certain vote choices, few studies have directed attention toward how social secrecy (or a lack thereof) influences voter behavior. In this study, I conduct an RCT that aims to induce induce experimental variation in social secrecy. I then leverage this variation how social secrecy impacts voter behavior.   "
