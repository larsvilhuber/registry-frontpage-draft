abstract: "We conducted a survey of Turkish firms, using randomized treatments to provide varied information about inflation in a high-inflation environment. By matching the survey data with detailed firm-level data on exports, employment, credit, and foreign exchange transactions, we explore the impact of exogenous variations in inflation expectations on firms' behavior, borrowing decisions, and expectations. Our findings reveal three key insights. First, inflation expectations significantly impact firms' expected prices, wages, and unit costs, with pass-through rates reaching as high as 60% in a high-inflation environment—demonstrating a much stronger connection compared to low-inflation settings. Second, firms with heightened inflation expectations substantially increase their credit demand, shifting from short-term to long-term loans through the refinancing channel, with a significantly reduced cost. Specifically, a 10 percentage point increase in inflation expectations leads to a 3 percentage point rise in credit usage, accompanied by a 3 percentage point decline in borrowing costs. Additionally, firms with elevated inflation expectations are more likely to raise their foreign currency purchases while decreasing the share of FX-denominated credit on their liability side. Third, firms facing higher inflation expectations tend to reduce employment and sales, reflecting a stagflationary outlook. Despite the negative impact on sales and employment, total credit usage increases, driven by long-term borrowing as firms seek to lock in lower long-term rates in anticipation of further inflation, highlighting the importance of the refinancing channel."
