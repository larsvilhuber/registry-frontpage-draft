abstract: "In this study, we will conduct a field experiment to measure the effect of carbon footprint information provision on the meal choices of restaurant customers. Treatment restaurants will introduce menus providing additional carbon footprint information and “climate friendly” framing for a selection of “vegan swaps”, i.e. meat/dairy based meals for which an identical lower-carbon vegan alternative exists, while control restaurants will not provide any additional information. The objective of this study is to examine whether providing carbon footprint information can lead to greater uptake of low-carbon vegan swaps."
