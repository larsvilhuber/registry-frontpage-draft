abstract: "This experimental survey supplements observational analysis in the paper "Savings and consumption responses to student loan forbearance" (link attached). The survey has two purposes. First, in descriptive analysis, it investigates why borrowers with federal student debt continued to make payments a the onset of the opt-out federal student loan payment pause, even though continuing to repay is non-optimal. Second, using an experimental intervention, the survey evaluates whether framing a financial windfall as targeting people with student debt impacts student borrower debt repayment behavior. "
