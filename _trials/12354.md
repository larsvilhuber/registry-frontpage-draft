abstract: "We evaluate the effects of an organic vegetable technology promotion program on farm household wellbeing in the Philippines. Our study site is in the province of Laguna where there are a significant number of vegetable farmers working in small to medium-sized land areas. Recent organic vegetable technologies developed by the Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and Development will be marketed to vegetable growers. To determine the potential effect of adoption of these organic vegetable technologies, we conduct a randomized controlled trial on a set of potential farmers that may use the technology to switch from inorganic to organic farming. In addition, we explore whether women's status in the household influences adoption or treatment effects of the technology."
