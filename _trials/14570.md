abstract: "
We designed and implemented the Tuberculosis Screening RCT to explore how cost calculations shape the decision to comply with public health measures.  The study will be referred to as Wave IIa.  This initial trial registration is AEARCTR-0013055 (\url{https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/13055}).  A draft of the initial results is available \url{https://raymondduch.com/files/Ghana-Tuberculosis-Screening_Oct-2024.pdf}.  In this amended pre-registration we are proposing the implementation of additional data collection that would allow us to test more directly the effect of individualized messaging.  This study will be referred to as Wave IIb.

This registration describes the implementation of a follow-up study that would facilitate the estimation of the spillover effect of the enumerator messaging interventions.  The additional data collection adds a control arm with no enumerator messaging intervention.  We will then implement a version of the original cluster randomized RCT that has only two arms: In the control arm, 30 villages are treated with a two-day pop-up clinic that includes broadcasting announcements of the clinic location and dates (identical to those employed in the original Wave IIa version of the RCT).  In the treatment arm, administered to 25 villages, 26 randomly selected individuals in each village receive the identical health messaging plus telephone reminder treatment administered in the original Wave IIa trial.
