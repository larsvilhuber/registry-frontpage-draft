abstract: "Electric vehicles made up 0.7 percent of the U.S. vehicle stock in 2015, despite state and federal subsidies and incentives. This study analyzes the effect of email messages with different emphases on the decision to purchase a subsidized electric vehicle. Households with residential solar photovoltaic installations are randomly assigned to receive an email alerting them to a substantial ($10,000) electric vehicle rebate and emphasizing either economic or environmental incentives for electric vehicle ownership. A third, control group is not informed for the rebate until after the experiment. Households interested in the incentive must fill out a survey to access a promotional code, after which they can purchase a subsidized Nissan LEAF. We will compare the effect of the alternate messaging on survey completion and electric vehicle purchasing behavior. "
