abstract: "This study employs a survey experiment in which we use a standard social psychology induction of feelings of fear in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea to test in-group favoritism and out-group bias toward immigrants. This is done by measuring the effect of fear on political attitudes and its impact on in-group favoritism in a standard dictator game. The study will help us understand the importance of fear in inducing anti-immigrant sentiments and could shed some light on the role of the media in creating division.
