abstract: "We develop a parsimonious behavioral game theoretical model for a dictator game where dictators can or cannot delegate the decisions to a randomly chosen agent. We then perform an online experiment where dictators can pay for increasing the probability that the selfish payoff division is implemented, either by deciding themselves or by delegating the decision to a randomly chosen agent. We use an incentive compatible price list approach to elicit the dictators’ willingness to pay. Our design allows us to quantify the (potential) dilution of responsibility by comparing the dictators’ average willingness to pay with and without delegation (see the “Intervention” for details)."
