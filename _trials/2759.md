abstract: "Using randomized survey experiments with politicians and the general population, we study how social mobility in education affects preferences for education policies. 

Our design allows us to address several important questions: i) which type of education policies are favoured?, ii) how do information about social mobility in education affect preferences for education policies?, iii) does it make a difference for preferences towards education policies if information about social mobility are provided for natives vs. foreigners? iv) to what extent are politicians different from the general population?

Our research design includes surveys with randomized components with politicians and the general population. The survey with polticians is sent out by email, using hand collected email information for local, federal-state and federal politicians in Germany. The survey with the general population will be representative for the general population and is carried out on our behalf by a commecial survey company."
