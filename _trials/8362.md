abstract: "As much as 40% of U.S. food production is lost or wasted. An estimated $218 billion a year spent to grow, process, and transport food in the U.S. goes towards the production of food that is never eaten. An incentive compatible second price Vickrey Experimental Auction (EA) will be used to examine how "best if used-by" dates affect consumer willingness to pay (WTP) for salads. While best if used-by dates are only an indication of quality, it is likely consumers prefer salads with the furthest-away best if used-by dates. This could cause best if used-by dates to lead to food waste. Therefore, this study explores how consumer confusion around best if used-by dates may affect consumer WTP for salads with varying best if used-by dates. Further, this study combines taste testing with the EA to determine if participants can determine a difference in taste for salads with varying best if used-by dates. Results of this study are informative for Food and Drug Administration regulations of best if used-by dates and sheds light on possible causes of food waste. "
