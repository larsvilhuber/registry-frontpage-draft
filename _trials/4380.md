abstract: "This experiment studies the effects of bureaucracy costs of social benefits on employment and part-time work. Together with the Social Insurance Institution (SII) of Finland, we set up a field experiment to analyze these effects. The introduction of the Income Register simplified the benefit application process when working part-time and claiming the adjusted unemployment benefits. Part-time workers no longer need to document their current earnings in the benefit application. We randomize unemployed individuals to use the new simplified benefit application before its nationwide implementation. The target group of the experiment is approximately 50,000 individuals of which 50% is randomized to the treatment and control groups. We will estimate the employment effects of this experiment using register data."
