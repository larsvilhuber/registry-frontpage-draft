abstract: "Social programs, such as affirmative action policies have been proved to be effective in many context to reduce gaps ratial or gender gaps in a variety of dimensions. However, the effectiveness of these types of interventions could be jeopardized by factors that reduce take-up, such as stigma. In this paper we test a low-cost nation-wide behavioral intervention, delivered through WhatsApp/SMS, to reduce stigma and improve the take-up of a free vocational training program, by afro-descendant individuals in Uruguay.  The intervention consisted in sending six messages during three weeks. The content of the messages was designed to reduce the individual and social stigma that is potentially related to attending the program. A placebo group received the same number of messages but with neutral information about the program. We measure the impact of our intervention using outcomes related to expression of interest (e.g., actively seeking information about the program), stigma-related beliefs from and end-up survey and program enrollment.
