abstract: "This study is a comprehensive research initiative to 1) quantify discrimination against diverse and vulnerable groups in the labor market in Latin American countries; and 2) test the effectiveness of behavioral interventions to reduce discrimination.  The primary methodology employed is field experiments, specifically "vignette studies," as described in the literature on experimental field economics. This approach has been previously applied by the researchers in this team:

The current study aims to measure discrimination and evaluate public policy options within the labor markets of Bolivia, Colombia, Perú, Paraguay, and Ecuador. The focus is on specific vulnerable populations:

In Bolivia, the study targets individuals with physical disabilities, rural-urban migrants, and transgender people.
In Colombia and Perú, the emphasis is on migrants and those with physical disabilities.
Paraguay's study centers on individuals with physical disabilities, women, and another yet-to-be-defined population.
Ecuador's research is on Venezuelan migrants, individuals with physical disabilities, and women.

The study is structured into several phases, all of which will be conducted in Bolivia, Colombia, Perú, Paraguay, and Ecuador:

Experimental Design Phase: This involves creating a virtual platform for participants who will be Human Resource Recruiters whom we will hire to conduct an experiment. Through this platform, they will replicate the selection processes for job applications associated with various job vacancies.
Experimental Implementation Phase: Data on recruiters' sociodemographic profiles and cognitive-socioemotional characteristics are collected. Recruiters will evaluate synthetic profiles of job applicants using the platform.
Results Analysis Phase: Data is compiled to study recruiters' responses. The findings will then be disseminated to inform public policymakers.
