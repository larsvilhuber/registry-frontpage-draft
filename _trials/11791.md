abstract: "In the proposed project, we are conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) which will be evaluated using surveys. In August 2022, the Department of Social Services of Los Angeles (LA DPSS) began implementing a two-part program called the “TAYportunity plus Guaranteed Income” Program in which work-ready young adults aged 18 to 24 receive an unconditional guaranteed income in addition to job-training and apprenticeship opportunities for 36 months. Among eligible individuals (see eligibility criteria below), we randomly selected 300 individuals to participate in the TAYportunity program, and another 650 individuals were randomly chosen for the control group. Throughout the 36-month program we will conduct several short, 15-minute surveys of all 950 study participants that will be completed online or by phone. The surveys will be the same as across survey rounds, so that we obtain repeated measures of the same outcomes over time. All respondents will be compensated $20 for completing each of the surveys."
