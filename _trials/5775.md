abstract: "In this online experiment, we measure people's beliefs about COVID-19, and how these beliefs causally influence people's willingness to social distance. We randomly assign participants to conditions where they are shown upper- and lower-bound estimates of the infectiousness of R0, and use this assignment in order to conduct instrumental variable regressions."
