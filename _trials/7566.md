abstract: "This study will investigate the discrimination against transgender people in the Swedish rental housing market. 800 applications will be sent out to various landlords advertising rental vacancies on the Swedish internet-site Blocket.se. To signal the gender identity of the four different testers (the cis man, the cis woman, the trans man, the trans woman) a name change will be used in the experiment, where the transgender people are identified by having one female and one male name. Besides studying the general discrimination against transgender people, the present study will also investigate if there is a difference in the discrimination level against transwomen and transmen. Given previous evidence of discrimination against men in the rental housing market, it will be of interest to see to which degree this affects transwomen and transmen. Furthermore, the study will examine if there exist varying degrees of discrimination depending on the gender of the landlord or if it is a company, and if discrimination differ by rental price, size or region in the country."
