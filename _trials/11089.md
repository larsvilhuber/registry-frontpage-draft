abstract: "Using a sample of 900 households, we use a randomized control trial to estimate the impact of urban farming using multi-storey gardens and black soldier fly frass fertilizer from recycled household waste on food and nutrition security in Kibera, the largest urban informal settlement in sub-Saharan Africa. It is likely that these treatments will improve household dietary diversity, food security, and food production.    "
