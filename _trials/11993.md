abstract: "This experiment aims to cleanly distinguish three channels of social influence: (1) conformity to in-group norms, (2) differentiation from out-group norms, and (3) social learning. It will examine the relative importance of the three channels under different settings, and use that distinction to help clarify how norms change. To this end, Indian participants (primarily from Uttar Pradesh) and Pakistani participants will be recruited from large Internet panels. Participants will be asked to privately make a series of binary choices. One set of choices will involve choosing one stock from a given pair, where the participant’s payoff depends on the subsequent performance of the stocks. Stakes will be substantial, on the order of a daily wage, and will vary across participants. Participants will also be asked for their opinions on a variety of social and economic issues. 

Pairs of stocks will be of three types: (i) Neutral stocks: pairs where both stocks are of firms based in the USA. (ii) National stocks, same country: pairs where both stocks are of firms based in one of the two surveyed countries, either India or Pakistan, and where company names clearly indicate that they are based in that specific country. Thus, nationality is made more salient, and in addition, participants from the relevant companies’ country are likely to be perceived as having more stock-related knowledge. (iii) National stocks, different countries: pairs where one stock is of a firm based in India, and the other stock is of a firm based in Pakistan. This will allow testing for home (ingroup) bias in stock picking, and examine how this bias interacts with ingroup conformity, outgroup differentiation and learning.  

To allow social learning, choice items will ideally involve some uncertainty about their intrinsic value. Items will be selected based on preliminary surveys in both countries, and to the extent possible will be chosen to reduce preexisting cross-country differences in dispositions, and beliefs about group norms. In addition, some items will be selected from the World Values Survey (WVS), based on surveys already conducted in India and Pakistan. Items will be chosen to reduce as much as possible preexisting cross-country differences in dispositions and group norms.

Survey participants will be randomly assigned to either receive or not receive information about the choices of previous participants. Those who receive social information will be matched with a random sample from each nationality group participating in the preliminary surveys (or, as appropriate, the WVS). Before making each choice, they will be informed of the descriptive norms prevailing in the samples of nationality groups assigned to them. Comparing the choices of survey participants observing different (or no) combinations of in-group and out-group norms, will allow us to disentangle the three channels of social influence. 

To reduce potential experimenter demand effects, participants will not be told that this is a study about group norms or group behavior, and will not be asked about their attachment to the groups prior to making their choices. They will only be informed that this is part of an international study, that they will be given information on choices made by participants in studies that were already conducted in two countries, and that they would be informed about where these previous studies were conducted. 

To help understand the importance of financial stakes for following behavior, we will vary the stakes in the stock choices across participants. 

To help understand the effect of the above three channels even on central, and possibly deeply-held, views and opinions, we will include in this study questions from the WVS. Unlike policies chosen from our own preliminary survey, the perceptions of social norms in these matters will not be tightly controlled by the experimenter, and may not be significantly affected by the social information we provide. Participants may also be less uncertain about their views on such matters, and hence less likely to rely on the information we provide. Nonetheless, it is of interest to study whether any of the above three channels can be detected using our methodology even for such issues. "
