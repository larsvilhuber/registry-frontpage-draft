abstract: "This study aims to understand how experimentation affects job search and career choices. We hypothesize that encouraging teenagers’ experimentation of different occupations will affect their job search and ultimately help them make better choices for their career. To test this hypothesis, we designed a field experiment in collaboration with firms where the treatment consists of experiencing the real-life work environment in an occupation that the student had not considered. We compare the treated group to a control group that instead experience an occupation similar (or identical) to their preferred occupation.
We have already registered and submitted a pre-analysis plan (PAP) about a similar experiment we conduct with schools. This registration is for a second experiment that will be conducted in collaboration with firms.
