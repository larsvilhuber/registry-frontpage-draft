abstract: "In this project we will evaluate a parenting program, "Parentalidades Comprometidas" (PPC), aimed at families with children between the ages of 0 and 3 attending early childhood centers in Uruguay.

The evaluation of the program will generate evidence on the characteristics of the implementation of parenting programs in Uruguay, and will shed new light on which components of the program work and which do not. The evaluation will allow us to analyze whether or not PPC is achieving its intended objectives. "
