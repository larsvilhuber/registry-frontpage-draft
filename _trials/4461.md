abstract: "This study contains eight survey experiments.

1. This list experiment (item count experiment) aims to produce an estimate of the share of people in the United States who have favorable opinions of Russia and the share of people in Russia who have favorable opinions of the United States while shielding them from social desirability pressures that might be involved in asking the question directly. By comparing the experiment’s result with the results of direct questioning about country favorability, we gain an estimate of the extent to which respondents are insincerely reporting their attitudes to the other country in direct questioning.

2. This study employs a priming experiment to assess the degree to which self-reported country favorability (specifically, of Russia in the US and of the US in Russia) can be manipulated by different primes. The primes are designed to convey bases for hostility (senses of threat and divergent interests) and bases for good relations (common threats, historic cooperation).

3. For Russia only, this experiment asks Russians about how they think their government should treat an entity that is described in randomly assigned ways as: the West, the EU, and the United States. The difference will shed light on the degree to which hostility toward the EU and US are both part of a broader anti-Westernism in Russia.

4. This priming experiment explores the extent to which preferences for compromise in the US and Russia on their mutual relations (both generally and on the case of the Ukraine conflict) can vary when people are led to have different considerations in mind. Considerations raised include the need to avoid catastrophic war, prospects for economic benefit, concern for ordinary people in countries that are the site of “proxy conflicts,” and the common enemy of terrorism.

5. This endorsement experiment, conducted in the US and Russia, examines the degree to which individuals’ attitudes to the other country’s president (favorability) are led by their own political leaders. In Russia, the treatment involves Putin’s praise of Trump. In the US, treatments involve Republican criticism of Putin, Trump’s praise of Putin, and Republican criticism and Trump’s praise together.

6. This endorsement experiment investigates whether self-reported attitudes in the US and Russia on the integrity of the other country’s top leadership are strongly led by media source. In Russia, treatments include exposure to reports by the state-owned First Channel and the independent Dozhd’ channel on corruption in the US leadership. In the US, treatments include exposure to reports by Fox News and the New York Times on corruption in the Russian leadership.

7. This experiment examines the degree to which election preferences are potentially influenced by US-Russian relations. Respondents are presented with candidates hypothetically on a presidential ballot for their own country and then with a list of parties likely to compete in their own country’s next national legislative election. Prior to the voting question, respondents are primed to have in mind foreign policy threats from the other country that are widely reported in media, warnings against intervention by the other country in one’s own country’s domestic politics that are often heard in media, common interests in avoiding nuclear war, and calls for simply normalizing relations between the two countries.

8. This priming experiment considers whether branding the current state of US-Russian relations as a “new cold war” primes individuals to favor or oppose policies of containment and cooperation."
