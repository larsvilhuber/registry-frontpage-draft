abstract: "This document describes the pre-analysis plan for a randomized experiment examining the relationship between moral self-concept and charitable giving. Using the Amazon Mechanical Turk, respondents will complete an implicit association test (IAT), a questionnaire on support for redistributive polices, negative affect, self-esteem, omission bias; and have an opportunity to give a portion of their earnings to a charitable organization. A randomly assigned treatment group will be told that they posses strong implicit bias, while the control group will remain unaware of their results. The pre-analysis plan outlines our hypotheses, schedule of tasks, and empirical strategy. In order to guarantee transparency and bind ourselves from “fishing for results” we will pre-register the program producing our main results along with this pre-analysis plan."
