abstract: "We study the perception of tail risks in a large sample of representative households. We elicit their assessments regarding the probability of several tail risks, the impact conditional on occurrence (similar to loss given default), and the implications for individuals' behavior. Information treatments allow us to assess the impact of news on individuals' tail risk perception. Key questions that we seek to answer are the extent and sources of tail risk neglect. "
