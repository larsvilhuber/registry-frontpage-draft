abstract: "ideas42 is working with the Kinshasa cash transfer team, including the DRC World Bank social protection team and the Fonds Sociale du DRC (FSRDC) with the aim to develop behavioral messages to send transfer recipients messages around the time of transfer disbursement that help them optimally spend the cash they receive. Through the program, households located in urban Kinshasa that have been identified as vulnerable will complete a SMS survey to register, after which they will receive a cash transfer of USD 25 per month for six months sent through mobile money. GDP per capita in the DRC is about USD 581 , which makes each monthly transfer about 4% of GDP per capita. The team has been developing ‘traditional’ messages to send during disbursement of the transfer to inform recipients of ways to use their cash, including messages about financial literacy and human capital. In parallel, ideas42 is working to develop a set of behavioral messages to help transfer recipients identify and follow through on spending the transfer on their priorities.  During the first disbursement of the Kinshasa cash transfer program in mid-February, we intend to test the ‘traditional’ messages and the ‘behavioral’ messages to identify which set of messages is more effective at helping transfer recipients optimally spend the cash they receive."
