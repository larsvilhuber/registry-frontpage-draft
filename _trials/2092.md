abstract: "This project will assess the impacts of (1) providing cocoa farmers in Sumatra, Indonesia, with a sustainability program, through a randomised control trial (RCT) design, and (2) the impacts of sustainability certification on cocoa farmers, through a regression discontinuity design (RDD). The farmers will be recruited in 4 cohorts from 2017-2019. The intervention and baseline survey for cohort 1 will launch in mid-May, 2017, and subsequent cohorts will roll out over the intervening period. Variables of interest include certification outcomes (knowledge and participation in schemes), farm-level outcomes (yield, productivity, farm practices), household-level outcomes (revenues, socio-economic outcomes such as health, education and living conditions), and farmer group and community level variables."
