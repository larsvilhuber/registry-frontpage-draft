abstract: "The key objectives of this research are i) to test whether a scalable and cost-effective approach to closing the gap in management practices between developing and more developed countries can be implemented; and ii) to measure the impact of closing this management gap on firm productivity and profitability. It will do this by means of a randomized experiment in Colombia, which will allocate firms into three groups: a control group who just receive a diagnostic on their management practices, an individualized treatment group who receive one-on-one consulting to improve 5 different processes: Logistics, Human Resources, Finance, Marketing and Sales, and Production; and a treatment group in which management improvements will be implemented in a small group setting, analogous to agricultural extension, with firms learning from one another. The interventions take place over a 6 month period and are intended to improve growth, productivity, and the scope for innovation in these businesses."
