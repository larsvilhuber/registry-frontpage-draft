abstract: "Because of the bidirectional and entangled relationships between patients with bipolar disorder (BPD) and the family system, using family interventions has been emphasized. However, the effects of family interventions on family function and caregivers’ health-related outcomes have not been well investigated. This randomized controlled trial with 47 hospitalized patient-with-BPD/family-caregiver dyads at a medical center in northern Taiwan compared the effects of a brief family-centered care (BFCC) program with treatment-as-usual (TAU). In the experimental group, four 90-minute BFCC program sessions were provided twice a week for each hospitalized family dyad. Family caregivers in the TAU group were invited to attend a 60-minute family discussion group about violence and suicide prevention without any specific family-nursing intervention. Three outcome indicators—family function, caregivers’ perceived health status, and caregivers’ burden—were assessed at baseline and post-treatment. The BFCC group showed significant time  group interaction effects in overall family function and subscale-conflict, communication, and problem solving (p = 0.009-0.037), but there were no significant interaction effects on the caregivers’ perceived health status and burdens. Our findings support both the feasibility of using the BFCC program for inpatients and its specific benefits for family function. An intensive family intervention during hospitalization has been suggested in psychiatric practice to support patients with BPD and family caregivers.
