abstract: "The practice of child marriage is still prevalent in several pockets in Indonesia and often leads to discontinuation of post-primary education, particularly among girls. Our proposed intervention aims to reduce the incidence of child marriage and improve post-primary education outcomes by addressing the underlying factors of child marriage: religious beliefs and present bias. An information campaign, which provides an alternative religious view about child marriage and raises awareness about the risks associated with child marriage, will be delivered through short videos shown as intermissions during community movie screenings or religious gatherings. We design a three-arm cluster randomized controlled trial at the school level to test the effectiveness of information campaign and the content of the information campaign. We deliver the intervention via WhatsApp to mitigate the limitations of face-to-face interaction. The impact evaluation will be conducted in Central and East Java, in districts with high incidences of child marriage. The immediate outcomes of interest are perception and attitudes toward child marriage issues, while the long-run outcomes are educational attainment.
