abstract: "Are high-risk individuals more likely to avoid the disease test because of information avoidance? We conduct a randomized field experiment in rural China to investigate the issue. We vary the price of the diabetes test (price treatments) and offer both the diabetes test and the cancer test (disease treatments) after eliciting participantsâ€™ subjective beliefs on the risk of having the corresponding disease. We find that both the low- and high-risk group avoid the test, and this pattern is more salient when test price is higher and the disease is more severe. We derive the new predictions from the optimal expectation model in Oster et al. (2013a) to explain our empirical findings. Structural estimation suggests that individuals attach about half of the weight to anticipatory utility compared to the consumption utility, leading to information avoidance. Simulation also suggests that neoclassical view systematically underestimates the importance of subsidy or mandate policies."
