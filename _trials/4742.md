abstract: "The residents of Delhi, India face some of the highest concentrations of air pollution in the world. Yet it has been fairly uncommon to observe people defending themselves against the harmful effects of air pollution. Although air quality has recently emerged as a political priority, anecdotal evidence suggests that demand for clean air remains low. A potential explanation for low demand is lack of awareness about both pollution and its long-term health impacts. In this proposed experiment, we randomly assign (a) indoor air-quality sensors, (b) information about the health impacts of air pollution and common defensive tactics, (c) peer comparisons, and (d) novel air purifier rental contracts across roughly 3,000 households across Delhi. The experimental design will allow us to estimate the causal impact of enhancing air pollution awareness on the willingness-to-pay for clean air."
