abstract: "This study analyzes the impact of a cap-and-trade game on student knowledge of and attitudes towards environmental policy. The planned experiment uses undergraduate economics students at a large public university and uses survey data from before and after the game to measure attitudes towards environmental policy and knowledge of cap-and-trade policy. In addition, the experiment will employ random assignment of participation in an in-class game. The game is intended as an interactive method to teach students about cap-and trade policies which are popular mechanisms for reducing pollution and uses both technology and in-person interaction. This study contributes to the literature on active learning methods in environmental economics while also exploring the impact of teaching about environmental policy.
