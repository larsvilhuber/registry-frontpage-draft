abstract: "In Northern Ghana, rural markets for agricultural inputs are largely absent, resulting in productivity and welfare losses. This project evaluates the Village Input Fairs (VIF) model while it scales. The VIF offers a private-sector solution for creating agricultural input markets, simultaneously alleviating multiple supply and demand-side constraints. 

On the demand side, farmers use early commitment contracts to order inputs in the post-harvest period for delivery in the planting season and have access to credit. On the supply side, ag-dealers select VIFs to supply which are coordinated by private VIF enterprises. Private VIF enterprises are the market-makers, providing ag-dealers access to VIF markets, coordinating with microfinance partners, and generating revenue from the license sales to cover their costs.

This research will answer questions about the effectiveness of private sector scaling strategies on input demand and supply side constraints of ag-dealers."
