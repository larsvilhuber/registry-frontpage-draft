abstract: "Despite the prevalence of non-routine analytical team tasks in modern economies, little is known about how incentives influence performance in these tasks. In an earlier field experiment with more than 3,000 participants, we documented a positive effect of bonus incentives on the probability of completion of such a non-routine team task (a real-life escape game). To investigate which dimensions of effort are most affected by team incentives, this additional study implements an experiment that closely resembles real-life escape games and contains all relevant aspects of them. In particular, in this study, teams again have to solve a series of complex and novel problems, need to collect and recombine information, and have to solve analytical and cognitively demanding quests that require thinking outside the box. The experiment allows us to determine how incentives impact performance by exogenously varying the most important margins of team production that incentives can affect. 
The experiment is based on a board game version of a real-life escape game.  Following a natural field experiment (involving a real-life escape game) we conducted earlier, we implement three treatments: In BGControl, teams are not provided with any monetary incentives and have 60 minutes to complete the task for a flat payment (irrespective of success). In BGGain45, subjects can receive an additional team bonus if they succeed in completing the task in less than 45 minutes, and treatment BGLoss45 implements the same treatment but with a loss frame. The additional experiment has three main objectives. First, we test if bonus incentives causally affect whether teams assign the most skilled team member to a specific sub-task (skill-to-task matching) and analyze how this subsequently maps into performance. Second, we investigate the causal effect of incentives on the likelihood of team members sharing relevant information (information sharing) to facilitate task completion. Third, we study the causal effect of incentives on communication and provide additional causal evidence on how communication subsequently maps into performance."
