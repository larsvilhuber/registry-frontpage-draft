abstract: "The Cambodia Nutrition Project (CNP) is a five-year project to anchor the RGC’s enhanced and coordinated response to accelerate the human capital formation focusing on MCHN in the early years.  The CNP addresses Cambodia’s persistent high levels of stunting and aims to close equity gaps in nutrition, routine immunization, and neonatal survival.
The project will enhance supply-side delivery and quality of priority health and nutrition services in health facility and health outreach activities. It will also extend service provision beyond health facilities through enhanced integrated health outreach activities for pregnant and lactating women children and a harmonized approach to engaging local government for community mobilization and service delivery for health and nutrition. In so doing, the project will aim to increase demand for priority services. The project will build capacity from the central to the frontline levels in functional, technical, and financial management aspects.
The CNP’s impact evaluation aims to quantify and attribute the plausible impact of the project interventions in achieving changes in priority health and nutrition outcomes and to document contextual factors that influence the operational effectiveness. To answer these questions, the study follows a matched difference-in-differences design. Administrative districts (ADs) receiving the CNP intervention were randomly allocated into two groups implementing the intervention in two phases. Control ADs were matched based on key outcomes prior to the start of the baseline.
The study will deploy repeated cross-sections of mothers of children and children. Three survey rounds will be conducted to collect both longitudinal and cross-sectional data: a baseline survey, a midline survey one year after intervention rollout, and an endline survey after about 3.5 years of intervention.
