abstract: "Growing vaccine hesitancy is a well-documented trend, which may affect the uptake of COVID-19 vaccine. This study aims to determine vaccine uptake across a range of characteristics of the virus and the vaccine. We will conduct a survey in which we vary the value of key parameters, such as (i) the duration of clinical development, (ii) the risk of side effects, (iii) the prevalence of the virus, the vaccine uptake rate once available, and (iv) the reported effectiveness of the vaccine in protecting people from becoming infected. We will determine the proportion of the population that would be willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine right away and 6 months after the vaccine has been available. We will also include an information treatment that informs participants of the rigor of the vaccine trials.
