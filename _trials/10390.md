abstract: "The first step from a position without team responsibility to a managerial position is a key bottleneck in women’s career progression. This experimental study investigates i) whether differences in self-assessment across genders exist with respect to team leadership positions and ii) whether these differences are malleable by exposing candidates to experience with the specific role of a team leader. Subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment – the leadership position – or control – a team member position. The leader’s task is to motivate subjects playing a public good game through bilateral communication. A measure of preferences for team leadership is elicited by a second-price auction which allows to compare leadership preferences of treated and untreated subjects by gender. The results of this experiment can help to understand whether exogenously exposing employees to leadership experience can increase the number of (female) applicants for leadership positions and thus decrease the gender representation gap.
