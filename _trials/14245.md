abstract: "Research on how social norms influence Labour market behaviors and outcomes has flourished over the past few decades. For instance, it has been argued that there is a social norm to work which explains why unemployment negatively impacts workers’ mental health and wellbeing (e.g., Günther et al. 2024). The norm might also contribute to their job search efforts and (un)willingness to claim financial assistance they are eligible for. 
Previous studies in this context have relied on indirect methods of eliciting this norm to work, for example, by using proxies such as the local unemployment rate (e.g., Clark 2003) or the local support for cuts in unemployment benefits (Stutzer and Lalive 2004). However, indirect proxies are, in principle, open to alternative interpretations. Moreover, it is to date largely unclear what exact behavior this supposed social norm to work prescribes (Chadi and Hetschko 2024). For example, does the norm require people to do market work or do household work or volunteering suffice to meet the norm? Another open question is whether the norm’s strength depends on individual characteristics, whereby obvious guesses are gender and the cultural background of a person. For instance, there is a lack of research on the topic in non-Western contexts. Answers to these questions will inform society about starting points for interventions alleviating the misery of the unemployed and bear implications for tailoring job search incentives and benefit policies. 
The methodology of the project adopts the elicitation method for social norms proposed by Krupka and Weber (2013). In the process, incentivized survey experiments (factorial surveys) are used to causally identify the existence and strength of the social norm to work across a variety of contexts. Participants are presented with different scenarios of hypothetical choices, in our case, an unemployed person who accepts/rejects a job offer under certain circumstances (their gender, time use, race, culture), and are asked to indicate how socially appropriate they believe the majority of participants will deem the choice.
What is more, we are interested in the extent to which the provision of information can alter people’s assessment of what is socially appropriate and, hence, their perception of the social norm to work. To this end, we provide participants with information potentially altering their beliefs about the majority view. We inform randomly selected respondents that an increasing number of women are working outside the household, or that many unemployed people do not claim the financial assistance they are entitled, too.
