abstract: "We aim to examine the impact of mental health on academic performance and the role played by reflection and literacy intervention. In that attempt, primary data of students of an undergraduate course at the University of W端rzburg will be collected during one academic semester. We contribute to the existing literature by measuring both the impact of our intervention on mental health and the effect of mental health on academic performance. The results will test whether a reflection and/or a potential literacy intervention in the classroom can significantly affect mental health."
