abstract: "This is an interdisciplinary project that will create new knowledge and sound empirical evidence acquired by experimentation that will fill important knowledge gaps within transport, behavioral, environmental and political economics. By using a mix of methods from economics, psychology, political and data science, and gathering a rich set of different data, the project aims to answer a set of bold research questions that will contribute to the shift to a sustainable transport system. The overarching focus is to address the tradeoff between policy effectiveness and acceptability in the transport sector, in search for the optimal balance. We develop ad-hoc choice experiments to understand how to facilitate policy acceptability, specifically applied to the transport sector. "
