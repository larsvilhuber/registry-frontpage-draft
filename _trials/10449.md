abstract: "AutoML is a promising field of Machine Learning in which even non-experts can participate in the advantages of data science and, for instance, benefit from predictions of algorithms. However, non-experts cannot necessarily evaluate the benefits of AutoML predictions and, hence, decide against those predictions and rather trust in their own expertise of their field even if it is not rational to do so (i.e., algorithm aversion; Burton et al. 2020, Jussupow et al. 2020). For instance, an engineer who is responsible for the maintenance of a production unit and worked at the machine for several years, determines the timing of maintenance based on his experience no matter what a recently installed maintenance artificial intelligence (AI) predicts. As AI is more efficient for many tasks, we investigate how to foster trust of domain experts in AI technologies. Coproduction (i.e., the engagement of customers in the production process) has shown the strived effects in the provision of services as well as classic production set-ups. There is also evidence, that algorithm aversion decreases when users can modify these algorithms (Dietvorst et al. 2018) 
In our experimental study we examine whether this effect holds in an AutoML set-up. We create an environment, in which subjects act as engineers and are confronted with an AI that helps to predict malfunctions of their machine. We implement two groups (i.e., baseline group and coproduction group) and compare between those groups whether coproduction indeed fosters trust of the subjects resulting in decisions that are more conform with the AI predictions."
