abstract: "In this pre-analysis plan, we describe a choice experiment that induces exogenous variation in the attributes of high-profile jobs. We focus on a specific type of high-profile job, namely tenured professorships, and aim at identifying the willingness to pay for certain job attributes among highly educated workers who actually hold this type of job, or will likely negotiate about a tenured professorship in the near future. The key features of the experimental design follow Maestas et al. (2018). The job attributes we study include performance-related pay, the option to negotiate about further pay increases, and mobility requirements. Special attention will be given to gender differences in the willingness-to-pay for (avoiding) these attributes.

UPDATE:
The original choice experiment induces exogenous variation in the attributes of high-profile jobs. We conducted the experiment and, in accordance with the pre-analysis plan, devoted special attention to gender differences in the WTP for job attributes. Importantly, we did not find any such differences across the attributes we study, with the exception of a higher WTP among women for gender diversity among high-profile co-workers. We now plan to extend the experimental design to shed light on the reasons for the absence of gender differences where previous literature suggests such differences should occur. Our main focus will be on selection into high-profile jobs based on preferences (risk preferences, willingness to compete, family-related preferences). For that purpose, we will run similar choice experiments as the one described in the original registration in a sample of Ph.D. students and a sample of university students (i.e., of highly educated individuals before selection into high-profile jobs has taken place). Data collection for the extension will start on October 30, 2023."
