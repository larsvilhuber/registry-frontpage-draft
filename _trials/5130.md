abstract: "In a field experiment, we test different arguments for registering for a service that automatically switches its customers’ energy contracts, aiming at minimizing their costs. We are in particular interested in whether people’s aversion to delegate a decision or their lack of knowledge regarding the advantages of such a service affect their decision to take up the automatic service. Our setup is an Email-campaign of a German service provider asking the customers to make use of the new service."
