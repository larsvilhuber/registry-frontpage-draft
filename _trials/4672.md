abstract: "Abstract
Background/Objective: Teaching has been found to be one of the most stressful occupations worldwide. Stress associated with teaching is more critical among teachers teaching children with special needs in general and those with autism specifically, partly due to the heterogeneous nature of the disorders. Managing job-stress among teachers of children with autism (CWA) could improve their mental and physical well-being, reduce turn over and improve overall school outputs. The current study sought to investigate the effectiveness of Rational Emotive Occupational Health coaching (REOHC) in minimizing job-stress among teachers who teach children with autism.

Methods: A group-randomized waitlist control trial design was adopted. A sample of 87 teachers of CWA who participated in the study was randomized into the immediate intervention group (IIG) and waitlist group (WLG). Participants were evaluated on three occasions: pre-test, post-test, and follow-up. Three instruments (Occupational Stress Index, Perceived Occupational Stress Scale. and Stress Symptom Scale) were used to measure dimensions of job-stress. After pre-test exercise, the IIG participated in a 2hours REOHC program weekly for a period of 12 weeks. Post and follow-up evaluations were conducted respectively at 2week and three months after the REOHC. Those in WLG were exposed to the REOHC after the follow-up assessment. Data collected were analyzed using t-test statistics, repeated measures ANOVA and charts.  

Results: Results revealed that compared to the WLG, the perceived stress and stress symptoms of the IIG reduced significantly at the post-test, and the reduction was maintained through the follow-up assessment. Changes in occupational stress index sores across pre, post and follow-up measurements were minimal and could not account for a significant difference between the IIG and WLG.

Conclusion: Though REOHC was effective in minimizing perceived occupational stress and stress symptoms, the occupational indices were not significantly minimized in teachers of CWA. It was therefore concluded that REOHC can be effective in managing the subjective feelings and symptoms of job-stress, even when the objective stressors remain constant among teachers of CWA and other employees who work under stressful occupational environments.
