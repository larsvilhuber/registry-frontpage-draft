abstract: "ABSTRACT
Background: The rising incidence of sudden cardiac death highlights the need for more effective Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation then use the abbreviation CPR training. Standardized CPR training methods face significant challenges in accessibility, engagement, knowledge and skill retention, Further issues are compounded in regions like Palestine with unique barriers. The new immersive virtual reality (IVR) technology recently utilized and employed in CPR learning shows promise with its realistic simulations by allowing learners to experience a variety of situations that they might not otherwise encounter. The IVR leads to higher levels of learner motivation, interest, and engagement crucial for learning complex emergency procedures like CPR, and the learner's active participation in the training process enhances knowledge retention and skill acquisition rather than standardized learning methods. This necessitates further research to explore IVRs potential to enhance knowledge, skills, and decision-making in emergency CPR situations.
Aim: To examine differences in knowledge, performance, satisfaction, and self-confidence between the immersive virtual reality heart-saver group and the standardized heart-saver group among non-health students at Arab American University in Palestine.
Methods: This study employed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design to compare the differences between the immersive virtual reality heart-saver training and the standardized heart-saver training among non-health science students at the Arab American University in Palestine. The study conducted from July to December 2023, with a focus on enhancing CPR knowledge, skill performance, satisfaction and self-confidence, 200 participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental IVR group or the control group undergoing standardized training. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS version 25, incorporating tests like independent t-tests, chi-square, and repeated measures ANOVA.
Results: Participants demonstrated substantial improvement in CPR knowledge from pre-test to post-test, with the IVR HS group’s scores rising from 2.79±2.01 pre-test to 8.40±1.01 post-test and the Standardized group from 2.57±2.11 to 8.21±1.37, but there was no significant difference in the rate of improvement between the two groups. Performance (chi-square value = 15.674, df = 1, p = 0.001) significantly differed between groups. Performance evaluations showed 85% of IVR HS participants passing, compared to 60% in the standardized group. Satisfaction and self-confidence levels showed no statistically significant differences between the groups. Although there were a few differences based on demographic and academic variables, the results showed minimal impact on outcomes, such as single participants in the IVR group reported higher knowledge gains.
Conclusion: The study confirmed that immersive virtual reality heart-saver training effectively improves CPR performance among non-health science students, compared to standardized heart-saver training. The IVR-based learning shows promise for non-health science student preparation. This emphasizes the importance of further exploration and adoption of IVR in educational settings to enhance emergency preparedness. the study recommends that, integrating HS with a curriculum of non-health science to provide evidence for policymakers to develop policies integrating HS training for non-health science students, leading to improved patient outcomes, decreased mortality rate and decreased hospital costs.
