abstract: "Digitalization is increasingly recognized as a crucial driver of business operations and competitiveness. However, causal empirical evidence linking digital adoption to Micro, Small, and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSME) productivity, growth, and resilience remains scarce. Information on effective public interventions to enhance technology adoption and usage among MSMEs is also limited. This research investigates the impact of digital technology adoption on MSME productivity and economic performance through a multi-country randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a firm-level support instrument. The study focuses on non-financial barriers such as limited technical expertise and inadequate managerial practices.

Utilizing data from the World Bank's Digitrans Project, which pilots an intervention targeting 900 MSMEs in Bulgaria, Poland, and Slovakia, this study examines the effectiveness of an instrument addressing non-financial challenges to MSME digitalization—primarily limited technical expertise and managerial practices—compared to an intervention providing only a time-limited financial incentive. By comparing outcomes of these two approaches, the study aims to elucidate the role of non-financial barriers in driving digital adoption and identify effective strategies for overcoming these obstacles."
