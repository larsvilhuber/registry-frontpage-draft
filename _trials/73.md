abstract: "This study aims to understand how imbalances between mothers and fathers in knowledge and decision-making power affect maternal and child health.   

The study compares three approaches: increasing mothers’ empowerment, increasing fathers’ knowledge about the health needs of children, and increasing mothers’ knowledge about the health needs of children.

Study villages in Southwest Uganda receive one of three treatments — a women´s nutrition education program, a men’s nutrition education program, or a joint women’s empowerment and nutrition education program — or are in the control group and received no intervention. The target population are parents of a child under age 2 or couples in which the woman is pregnant. The program consists of 20 classes, held bi-weekly, for a group of about 10 mothers or fathers. A baseline survey and anthropometric data were collected before the start of the program. An end-line survey will be collected one year after program implementation begins. "
