abstract: "This experiment aims to study the link between self-control and consumption financed through debt taking. During the experiment participants perform an ego-depletion task during which they have to cross out letters. The ego depletion task is followed by a round during which participants can buy drinks on loan. Both the ego-depletion task and the shopping task are repeated twice. In the first shopping round the loan charges 20% interest and in the second round 10%. In addition to measuring borrowing, we also perform manipulation checks to test if our treatment had the desired effect.  "
