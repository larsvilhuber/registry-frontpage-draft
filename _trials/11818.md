abstract: "We study the determinants of demand for legal services among tenants facing eviction in Memphis, Tennessee. We conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) using a survey with a control group and two treatments: (1) providing information on the effectiveness of eviction attorneys, and (2) building trust in the organization that provides the eviction attorneys. We study the impacts of these treatments on three primary incentivized outcomes: (1) willingness to accept between cash and an attorney, (2) forecasts of the effects of attorneys in reducing rates of evictions in the future, (3) strategies played in Trust Games (Berg et al., 1995) with eviction attorneys relative to various reference groups. We also collect the secondary outcome of (4) participation in a program offering free legal assistance."
