abstract: "This field study tests a school-based banking program in a US public school district. Schools were randomly selected to open an in-school bank branch, and a subset of students were randomly assigned incentives to  open an account at one of these branches. We focus on 4th grade (10 year old) students offered banking services, as well as those assigned an incentive to open an account. We measure changes in views of banks and financial services, as well as tests of objective financial literacy. While expanded access to a savings account at school boosts take-up of accounts, banking does not appear to substitute for financial literacy education. "
