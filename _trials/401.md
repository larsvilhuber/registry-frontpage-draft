abstract: "This pre-analysis plan details the analysis to be conducted on new data being collected for an evaluation of a micro-loan, grant and training program that was conducted at the end of 2013. Extensive data has already been collected on a range of business outcomes and has found significant effects of pairing ILO Start Your Business (SYB) trainings with microfinance on business outcomes for men. It is though unclear what the effect of these programs has been on general individual and household welfare. The next data collections will conduct two household follow-up surveys of the participants of the program to understand the long-term effect of cash grants and finance for both business and household welfare outcomes."
