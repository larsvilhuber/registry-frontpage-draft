abstract: "The study seeks to understand how providing analysis of bidding behavior to firms influence competition among firms. In many instances, bidding behavior of firms may not coincide with that implied by the competitive equilibrium of static auction models. Instead, bidding may be more consistent with strategies of non-stationary equilibrium. We first identify a set of firms whose bidding seems inconsistent with the equilibrium of standard static auction models and treat a subset of these firms with information about their bidding behavior."
