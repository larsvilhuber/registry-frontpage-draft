abstract: "The project aims to understand what factors matter most for U.S. public engagement in climate action.  In particular, the project aims to study how climate beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors relate to personal characteristics, demographic traits, and economic preferences.

The project will provide video treatments to see to what extent climate attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors change after receiving information on climate change.  The climate change videos are designed based on various theories from behavioral science and educational psychologyâ€”to see how different approaches to communicating climate change affect policy preferences and climate-friendly behaviors.

An obfuscated follow-up study will be conducted to test the persistence of treatment effects for individuals who participate in the main experimental survey."
