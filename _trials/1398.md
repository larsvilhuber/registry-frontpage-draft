abstract: "Since 1996, a leading supermarket chain store in Chile has allowed its costumers to donate to a prominent local non-profit organization as they pay for their purchases at the cash register. The two organizations will soon conduct a transparency campaign informing costumers that (1) 100% of the donations made at the supermarket cash registers go to the organization, (2) the supermarket cannot legally get a tax break from the donations it collects at its registers, and (3) donations can be made with any payment method. In collaboration with the charity and the supermarket chain, we selected a group of approximately 60 stores to implement an RCT to evaluate the impact of this campaign on donation behavior. To further investigate the effect of information on the reasons costumers give for donating or not at the cashiers, we collect survey data on beliefs about the destiny of their donations before and during the intervention."
