abstract: "The MCC-CDD Philippines study is a rigorous impact evaluation of a large-scale community-driven development (CDD) program, Kalahi-CIDSS, implemented by the Government of the Philippines.  The evaluation will measure the social capital, governance and socio-economic effects of the program.  In order to understand the programâ€™s impacts, the study has randomly assigned 198 eligible municipalities into treatment and control groups.  This randomization involved pairing comparable municipalities (based on their province, poverty levels and population densities) and holding public lottery drawings to allocate one of the municipalities in each pair to the treatment group that would be eligible to participate in the program.  The study will measure the program's impacts through surveys of households and community leaders in a random sample of villages from the 198 randomly selected municipalities participating in the study (one village per municipality).
