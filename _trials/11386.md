abstract: "We study the efficacy of rating systems, similar to the one used in online marketplaces. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of rating systems in assisting consumers with product selection, focusing on both vertical and horizontal markets. Additionally, we explore the impact of grouping ratings and implementing freezing periods on welfare in horizontally differentiated markets. Our research aims to answer the following questions:

1. Does the introduction of a rating system increase welfare in vertically differentiated markets? 
2. Does the introduction of a rating system increase welfare in horizontally differentiated markets? 
3. Does providing average reviews broken down by relevant individual characteristics (filtering) increase welfare in horizontally differentiated markets?
4. Does the introduction of a “freezing period” (the average rating is disclosed only when a minimum amount of ratings are available) improve welfare?

***************
New treatments for November 2024: 

AT1: Does the introduction of an algorithm based recommender system increase welfare in horizontally differentiated markets? How does it compare to filtering?
AT2: Does the combination of a "classical" rating system (as implemented in the earlier treatments) and the algorithm based recommender system increase welfare in the horizontal market and does the effect decrease over time?"
