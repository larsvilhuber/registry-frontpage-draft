abstract: "Worldwide 1 in 10 children are engaged in child labour. Often, these children do not attend school regularly; thus, their current and future well-being is threatened. In Ghana, more than 50% of children in cocoa-growing areas are engaged in child labourâ€”more than half a million children. A common approach to reducing child labour by the industry and policy is to tackle households' financial
constraints while promoting schooling. Often children are provided with "school kits" that include necessary school supplies such as a uniform, bag, shoes, books, and writing materials. Previous research has only looked at the impact of providing individual school items on education with limited results, and no study has analysed whether comprehensive school kits addressing the financial constraints of buying school equipment reduce child labour. Yet, children in low-income settings often suffer from a shortage of multiple school materials, which might be one of the reasons why children miss school in cocoa communities. This study conducts an experiment to examine the impact of school kits on child labour, school attendance, learning and child well-being in cocoa communities in Ghana. "
