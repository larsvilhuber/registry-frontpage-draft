abstract: "Negative marking in high stake competitive examinations is often used as a tool to identify true ability or academic rigor of young aspirants across the globe. Literature from global North/developed countries shows that MCQ-negative marking-based screening process places women at a disadvantageous position because they skip more questions/guess lesser questions either because of differences in the degree of risk or loss aversion or confidence, controlling for ability/subject knowledge. Evidence from global South/developing countries is almost absent, moreover providing mixed results. In our lab experiment set up, we randomize marking scheme with half of subjects falling into no penalty for wrong answers marking scheme (control group) and others in marking scheme having 50% penalty for wrong answers (treatment group). Our sample consists of students pursuing graduation from one of the Institutes of Eminence from India as these institutes have a long history of skewed gender ratio in application and take up of technical STEM courses.
