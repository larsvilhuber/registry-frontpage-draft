abstract: "We evaluate two interventions: a cash transfer program in urban Goma, D.R.C., and a soft skills, savings, and training intervention in rural Walungu, D.R.C.  The objectives of the study are to evaluate which program is a more impactful use of aid dollars.  However, as the programs are heterogeneous in location and implementation, they are anticipated to have their strongest impacts on different outcome variables. 
 This generates challenges in making fair comparisons through a single analysis plan.  We propose to use a flexible, data-driven analysis plan following Anderson and Magruder (2022) to identify impacts of each program and generate an apples-to-apples comparison which limits bias inherent to evaluation design.
