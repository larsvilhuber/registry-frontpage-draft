abstract: "In this second, ex-post wave, we re-contact participants of all experimental conditions after having experienced the summer (June - August) of 2024. We investigate how heterogeneity in experience and in the accuracy of prediction shape willingness-to-pay (revealed preferences) for seasonal and trust in long-run climate prediction, as well as revealed-preference support for adaptation and mitigation measures.
Design: All (including the control group) are given the prediction/risk-assessment (75th percentile of the number of tropical nights) and the observation according to official records for their region as well as information on the nation-wide accuracy of the risk-assessment. Half of participants are in addition presented with a graphical representation (on a map) of how the risk-assessment performed relative to observations. With respect to the elicitation of the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for seasonal predictions for summer 2025, we elicit WTP of the same risk assessment as used in the current study for half of participants. The other half is first asked to choose their preferred risk assessment (tropical nights vs. hot days / three levels of risk) before the WTP for the selected seasonal prediction is elicited.
In an independent random draw, half of participants is confronted with a statement that seasonal and long-run climate predictions are based on the same basic principles and similar models. The latter is inteded to exogenously vary the degree to which trust in seasonal predictions spills over to long-run predictions."
