abstract: "Ever-larger proportions of children are progressing to secondary schooling in India. However, weak foundational academic skills in primary schools have made it very challenging to provide effective instruction in secondary schools. Classroom instruction typically follows the syllabus and textbook in lock-step, but the translation of class time into learning may be very low since many students are far behind grade level competencies. We conducted a randomized evaluation of an innovative technology-led initiative to provide customized computer-based supplementary instruction to students in Grades 4-9, i.e. in primary, middle and lower secondary school grades, in deprived slum areas of Delhi. The evaluation will provide rigorous evidence on a promising model for improving learning outcomes for secondary school students, that combines the strength of remedial education programs with ICT tools for a replicable and scalable model for delivering supplementary secondary school instruction."
