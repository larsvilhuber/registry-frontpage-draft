abstract: "JEEViKA is a joint initiative of the Government of Bihar and World Bank that strives for the social and economic empowerment of the rural poor. Facebook and the BMGF (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) have partnered with JEEViKA to introduce peer groups of JEEViKA cadres on Facebook. As a part of that partnership CSBC (Center for Social and Behaviour Change) will conduct a rigorous evaluation to determine whether online peer training on topic-specific closed Facebook groups with carefully curated content improves topic knowledge, motivation, and job performance. To this end, we will conduct an RCT with a treatment group that includes participants in the health and nutrition Facebook group where they will receive knowledge collaterals as well as opportunities to engage in work-related conversations, and a control group with participants that are not part of any Facebook group. We will use baseline and endline phone surveys to measure the impact of the Facebook groups."
