abstract: "Directing students’ attention to the aspects of their life that they value can serve as a buffer against the activation of stereotype threat and anxiety in schooling. As a result, values affirmation exercises have been shown to result in improvements in academic performance. This positive effect may be particularly powerful when done before tests that are diagnostic and might confirm or disconfirm a stereotype about a groups’ performance. This study will evaluate if students of an accelerated youth literacy and numeracy program achieve higher scores on a test of their numeracy, Arabic, and English skills after completing a values affirmation task using drawing. The study will recruit participants of an accelerated education program in Lebanon between the ages of 14 and 24. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a values affirmation activity or a placebo activity of drawing a depiction of their morning routine."
