abstract: "This trial serves to complement results from previously collected data (not pre-registered). We examine the following: Do people have a taste for discrimination? We answer this question in a dictator game, allowing for Dictators to be strategically ignorant of the Recipients' payoffs (see Dana et al., 2007). Recipients are named either James or Mohammed -- names particularly associated with "Caucasian Christian" and "Muslim." We explore if people use the moral wiggle room created by strategic ignorance to discriminate against Mohammed. "
