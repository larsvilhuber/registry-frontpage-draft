abstract: "Using a natural field experiment conducted in collaboration with a large supermarket chain, we will study how customers’ demand is affected by tagging the product with the lowest regular unit price on the shelf within a category. Regular prices of products are defined as modal prices over the previous year. Our intervention will involve several stores and product categories and will last several weeks. "
