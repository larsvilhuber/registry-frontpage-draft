abstract: "For many women in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), income is highly variable, and financial shocks occur frequently.  We are interested in how women cope with such shocks and whether having liquid savings as a safety net may change their coping behaviors. We examine a range of economic behaviors of women and investigate how each behavior responds to shocks, both negative and positive. The primary research question is how the response of these behaviors to shocks is impacted by the presence of liquid savings. Our intervention is designed to provide women with a technology for savings, train them  on the importance of savings, provide regular reminders to save, and induce random windfalls so that cash is available for saving. High frequency data collection regarding idiosyncratic shocks as well as outcome behaviors will allow a comparison of behavioral responses across women with exogenously-induced higher levels of personal, liquid savings and women in the control group."
