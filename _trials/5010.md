abstract: "The higher education industry is currently being disrupted by new digital technologies such as massive open online courses (MOOCs). Although the reach of MOOCs is large, their impact is constrained by low learner engagement. Traditionally, educators have sought to enhance engagement by asking learners to share information about their identity or ideas. However, compared to traditional face-to-face classrooms, MOOCs are considerably larger, more diverse and highly impersonal. Thus, the effect of sharing oneâ€™s identity or ideas in MOOCs is uncertain. Our research examines the efficacy of these two types of information sharing upon learner engagement in MOOCs by conducting a multi-study investigation of nearly 15,000 learners. The field experiment will involve three conditions: (1) Control condition with no nudge to share, (2) Treatment 1 with a nudge to share ideas related to the course, and (3) Treatment 2 with a nudge to share identity related to the individual learners. The objective is to understand how different types of sharing impacts learners and how different learners may be impacted differently by studying the heterogeneous effects."
