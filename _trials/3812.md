abstract: "We will explore misconduct-reducing interventions that help low-income populations adopt, transact and save on Mobile Money -- a growing and well celebrated example of FinTech. We will address the questions of “How to measure financial misconduct?”, "What is the nature of and mechanisms underlying misconduct?"  and “How big is the impact of misconduct-reduction?” on M-Money. Results will have important implications for financial technology adoption and inclusion among low-income environments."
