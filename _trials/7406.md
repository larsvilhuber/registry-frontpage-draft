abstract: "This project intends to improve student's learning experiences and increase student success in online settings at the University of California-Irvine (UCI). The project has two main objectives: (i) to examine the impacts of collaborative learning strategies (structured and organized after-class virtual study groups) on students’ academic and social-emotional outcomes; (ii) to identify promising after-class study group facilitation strategies. To achieve this objective, I will carry out one randomized control trial. The intervention consists of assigning undergraduates to small virtual study groups to encourage them to have more after-class synchronous academic interaction activities and social connections. "
