abstract: "In this study, we will examine the role of activities promoting collegiality and a positive work environment. We are interested in evaluating to what extent these activities contribute to individual and team performance, and affect employee retention. We will conduct a randomized controlled experiment in which ‘fun activities’ are randomly assigned to different offices within a large firm. We will then examine the causal effects of these activities on office-level performance in a firm-wide competition between offices, average employee productivity (with a particular emphasis on less experienced employees), and employee retention over both 6 and 12-month periods.
