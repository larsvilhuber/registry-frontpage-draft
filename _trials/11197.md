abstract: "Prior real-effort labor market experiments find that the tax rate does not always have a negative effect on effort. This is not consistent with expected payoff-maximizing behavior as taxation reduces the marginal utility of effort. We address the puzzle by coontroling for social preferences. Using a stylized model, we show that stronger social preferences increase the marginal benefit of effort. We test this in a randomized laboratory experiment in which the subjects are alotted in groups. They complete paid typing tasks which income is taxed and the tax is redistributed within their group. We randomize the tax rate and estimate its effect between people of different social preferences."
