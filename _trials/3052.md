abstract: "A key challenge in developing countries interested in providing early childhood development programs at scale is whether these programs can be effectively delivered through existing public service infrastructures. This study evaluates the effects of a home-based parenting program delivered by cadres in China's Family Planning Commission (FPC). We conduct a randomized trial across 131 villages in rural China comparing 66 treatment villages, where cadres made weekly visits to households with children between 18 and 30 months of age to deliver a structured stage-based curriculum designed to teach parenting skills, with 65 villages in the control group. We evaluate the impacts of the program on measures of infant cognitive, psychomotor, and socio-emotional skills as well as parental skills and investment.
