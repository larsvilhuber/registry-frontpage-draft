abstract: "We investigate the effects of reporting loan delinquency information to a nationwide official credit score system combined with the financial incentive of deducting part of the overdue loan on loan delinquentsâ€™ repayment behavior. We do this using experimental manipulation in collaboration with a large Chinese P2P lending platform. We test for difference in repayment responses across treatments."
