abstract: "In many situations, consumers seek advice from more knowledgeable advisers/experts. However, it is very often the case that the adviser gets a certain bonus depending on the product the consumer ends up buying. In these situations, it is a priori unclear why the adviser should give good advice rather than collecting the highest possible bonus every time. We analyze a model of repeated advice in which the possibility of future bonus payments can motivate the adviser to give good advice even if this does not maximize his present payoff as good advice increases the chance that the consumer seeks advice from the adviser later on. We are particularly interested in the effect of learning in the sense that repeated interactions with a consumer allow the adviser to learn the consumer's preferences and therefore give better advice in the future. In a particular class of equilibria, both adviser and consumer benefit from this learning possibility. 
With this laboratory experiment, we aim at testing our theoretical predictions with actual decisions by subjects who are assigned the role of the adviser/expert or consumer, respectively. In particular, we are interested in (i) the distribution of payoffs between adviser and consumer (ii) the length of advice relationships and (iii) how (i) and (ii) depend on the adviser's learning.
