abstract: "A considerable number of studies compare the decision of individuals and groups in various contexts, and it is still growing literature. The standard view in the literature is that groups are better at solving intellective tasks, act more strategically, and engage in more self-interest behavior. An important implication for practice from the literature is that groups could be better-delegated agents to foster a specific outcome.

The previous literature on group decision-making, to the best of our knowledge, only focus on the decision environment without time pressure. However, a fundamental feature of decision-making in the real world is the time pressure from the deadline. We aim to narrow this gap in understanding by introducing the time-constrained into group decision-making in a lab experiment.
