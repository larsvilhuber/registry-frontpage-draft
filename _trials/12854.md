abstract: "The importance of human capital to firm value has led organizational scholars to take an interest in non-pecuniary incentives (NPIs) such as corporate social responsibility programs and public service jobs that affect worker preferences and behavior; however, one curious omission from these studies has been the NPI of religion. The goal of this paper is to account for this omission, and to demonstrate the significant impact organizational religiosity can have on a firm’s competitive positioning. Theoretically grounded in the existing literature on NPIs, I develop three related hypotheses. First, the extensive margin hypothesis is that the more religious the individual, the more willing they are to do more work for a more religious organization. Second the wage discount hypothesis is that – contributions held constant – the more religious the individual, the more their reservation wage is decreasing with an employer’s organizational religiosity. Finally, the excess contribution hypothesis is that – wages held constant – the more their contributions are increasing with an employer’s organizational religiosity. "
