abstract: "I will conduct a case-posting correspondence study on an online legal marketplace where people posts their cases and lawyers bid to represent them. This study will randomly assign race, gender, income, and prior arrests to a large number of fictitious case postings. I will study differences in the lawyer responses to determine whether and to what extent lawyers discriminate when it comes to deciding who to represent. "
