abstract: "This project aims to use experimental economics and educational science to improve students’ social emotional development in rural areas by conducting social and emotional learning courses in rural primary schools. The project will use randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the impact of social emotional learning (SEL) classes on students’ self-awareness, self-esteem, psychological health, interpersonal relationships, behavior problems, and psychological pressures. In the treatment arm, rural class teachers (without requirement on psychology background) will be given a 2-day training on SEL every semester and then asked to teach SEL classes to rural students once every week in consecutive semesters. The control group will not receive any treatment. This project aims to compare the effects of the intervention relative to the control group."
