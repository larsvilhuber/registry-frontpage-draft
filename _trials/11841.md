abstract: "Poor urban waste management has severe negative effects on health and economic outcomes. An effective approach to address this issue is the implementation of waste segregation at source, followed by adequate processing of the separated components. Co-opting households' participation in segregating waste is essential to the success of such systems. We conduct a randomized control trial among households in the Indian state of Bihar, to examine the effects of behavioural interventions on household waste segregation."
