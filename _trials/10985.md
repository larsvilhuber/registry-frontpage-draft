abstract: "This trial aims to develop a new paradigm for the control of dangerous insects patterned after the adaptive immune system. The project will adapt aspects of the immune system from the scale of cells to that of landscapes, and test the new approach against a conventional one using a randomized cluster design in an ongoing Chagas disease vector control program in the city of Arequipa, Peru. We will use a framework from Implementation Science—the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework— to ensure rigor and reproducibility. The trial and subsequent evaluations will bridge participatory research and computational sciences to develop sustainable systems for the surveillance and control of Chagas disease vectors, as well as disease agents in general.
