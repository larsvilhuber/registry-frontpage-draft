abstract: "The field experiment is carried out on 2,821 defaulted debtors with consumer debts in cooperation with a debt-collector enterprise in Latvia. The goal of the experiment is to examine the effect of three different regular mail debt reminder letters on paying back the debt. The control group receives a generic simple reminder, which resembles the usual reminder letter sent by the debt-collector at least once a year to each debtor. There are two treatment conditions. In both of them, a personalized letter is sent from a debt-collector's agent instead of a letter from the debt-collector's company. In one of the conditions the letter is sent and signed by a male agent, in the other one it is the female agent. Hence, the study has a factorial design with two factors: (1) personalization of the message and (2) gender of the debt-collector agent. The control group consists of 1,410 unique debtors while the two remaining groups consists of 706 (male agent) and 705 (female agent) individuals. "
