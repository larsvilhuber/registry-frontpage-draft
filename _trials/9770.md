abstract: "This project evaluates the effect of clown visits in hospitals on the physical and psychological well-being of patients, as assessed by their caregivers, and health care utilization in a middle-income developing country. The authors conduct a field study in cooperation with an international organization for clown visits operating in the Middle East. By randomizing the schedule of standardized interventions in hospitals, short-term hospitalized children are randomly assigned to two groups: clown visit and no clown visit. Field workers approach accompanying caregivers of both groups for consent to participate in the study and their agreement to take part in a telephone interview, held about ten days after recruiting. A comparison of the answers given in the interviews and the accompanying hospital data will shed light on the immediate effects of clown visits and potential spill-over effects on trust in the healthcare system.
