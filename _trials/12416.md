abstract: "This intervention aims to determine whether employers that post online vacancies discriminate against men and women applicants based on their potential and effective parental situation. We conduct a correspondence study in one of Colombia’s largest online platforms for job seekers, where we apply with six different profiles that vary by sex, effective parental status, and potential parental status. We will apply to different types of sectors and occupations to try and capture differences across economic activities that are male or female dominated. We expect this evidence to help disentangle the effect of discrimination due to potential and effective parenthood in online job applications, for which there is scarce evidence, especially in a developing country setting."
