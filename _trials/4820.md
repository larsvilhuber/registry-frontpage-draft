abstract: "We study the role of social interactions in shaping the evolution of political values and attitudes. Social interactions --- especially through the public expression of political values and attitudes --- interact with social image considerations, affecting not only belief updating about the social environment, but also information sharing within groups. This could generate multiple equilibria for the social group, depending on prior beliefs about the social environment and the nature of early interactions. To study this question, we combine a panel survey with a field experiment at a major US university. Our results are relevant to a wide range of settings in which social norms shape social learning."
