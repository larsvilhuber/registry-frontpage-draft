abstract: "This study examines how employers select employees for training and employee demand for training. We incentive-compatibly elicit employers' beliefs about which of their employees it would be socially optimal to train, as well as employers' preferences over which of their employees they choose to train. We will then investigate if employers' selection of workers is individually rational or driven by behavioral biases. Finally, we will measure employees' self-selection into training and its alignment with employers' selections. To ensure incentive compatibility of employer and employee choices, we provide employees from a sample of metalworking SMEs in Kampala, Uganda, with a free, high-quality skills training. In addition, we conduct practical skills tests to measure employee metal working skills before and after training."
