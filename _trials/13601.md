abstract: "The goal of this project is to study the pass of energy price shock using survey data and information treatments, and the relationship between pass-through rate and the value of loss load. Using a novel firm-level survey, we survey a large sample of firms (N=200-600) about their pass-through rate for past and future energy price shocks. We create information treatments, between firms, where we vary the nature of the energy price shock with the goal to identify the strategic component of energy price pass-through. In particular, we distinguish between country-level, sectoral, and firm-specific energy price shocks. For a small subset of surveyed firms, we plan to link the survey data with administrative data with electricity consumption and energy contract details. "
