abstract: "People are more likely to change their behaviour during moments of transition in their lives such as moving home, graduating, getting married, and changing job. In the context of increasing residential energy efficiency, it is important to reach homeowners during moments of change such as moving home or carrying out renovation works. As a government agency responsible for encouraging energy efficiency in the Irish residential sector, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) provides grants to homeowners to incentivise retrofit activity. Research by SEAI indicates that the frequency of extensive renovation works is approximately once every 15 years for the average homeowner. Likewise, purchasing a home is an extremely rare event in the average personâ€™s life. The infrequency of such behaviours highlights the importance of ensuring these decisions incorporate an element of energy efficiency. At the same time, 23,000 home extensions were carried out and 68,000 homes were purchased in Ireland last year. This large cohort of homeowners represents an opportunity for a timely communication to be made by SEAI in an effort to encourage energy efficient home renovations. The current project intends to carry out two randomised controlled trials focusing on the renovation and housing markets respectively. Homes that have submitted planning applications or that have been recently purchased will be contacted via mailshot by SEAI. The letters will highlight the benefits of carrying out energy efficiency upgrades in conjunction with renovation works and home purchases, and encourage homeowners to apply for a government grant from SEAI.
