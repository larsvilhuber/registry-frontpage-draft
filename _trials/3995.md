abstract: "This project will create a dataset consisting of the children of individuals who themselves previously benefited from a randomized health (deworming), vocational education, and/or cash grant intervention. The project will exploit experimental variation to estimate the causal impact of these earlier programs on the health, cognitive development, and other outcomes of the recipientsâ€™ children, overcoming the key methodological problem of confounding. The project will survey approximately 7,000 children aged 3-8 of the 7,500 respondents in the Kenya Life Panel Survey (KLPS), creating the new KLPS-Kids dataset, to estimate the extent to which these programs can help break the intergenerational transmission of poverty. Note that a pilot version of this trial was previously registered as AEA RCT #728."
