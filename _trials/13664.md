abstract: "Energy access is key to poverty alleviation. Despite featuring high in the development agenda, around 13% of the world still lacks electricity access. In many settings, gender norms entail that women carry the highest burden from household chores, such that the type of energy source and the quality of access may contribute to gender inequality across many outcomes. These gendered energy roles translate into different preferences for energy poverty reducing technologies, which suggests that the overall and distributional impacts of energy initiatives are contingent on the level of women empowerment. We implement a RCT in Myanmar, a country with conservative gender norms that also ranks low on energy access. We test a psychological empowerment intervention that combines an edutainment treatment with a series of goal setting and planning exercises to expose women in rural areas to role models with the goal of inducing higher aspirations around energy access and provide a blueprint to pursue them effectively."
