abstract: "The most popular voting rule in the U.S. and many other countries is plurality. Some major problems with this voting rule arise because of vote splitting, and there has been a growing movement to shift away from plurality to other voting rules. One of the most popular alternative forms of voting is ranked choice voting (RCV). Currently 261 U.S. jurisdictions use voting methods other than the most popular single winner-take-all system. This number is likely to grow in the coming years, despite the lack of understanding of the effect of alternative voting rules on voter participation and satisfaction. I will conduct an RCT that randomly assigns voters to systems that use different voting rules and measure the rate of return to future elections as well as changes in satisfaction. "
