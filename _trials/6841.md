abstract: "MDRC, in partnership with MEF Associates and Abt Associates, is conducting an evaluation of Central City Concern (CCC), as part of broader study called Building Evidence on Employment Strategies (BEES). BEES is funded by Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation within the Administration for Children and Families at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. CCC is an organization in Portland, Oregon that primarily serves adults with substance abuse disorders and provides treatment, health care, housing services, and employment services. The evaluation will be focused on two specific housing programs that CCC operates for those exiting a CCC-operated detox center. Each program offers a suite of recovery, housing, and employment services. The evaluation is using a randomized controlled trial to understand how access to these two housing programs affects outcomes related to employment, earnings, recovery, and housing. Individuals eligible for and interested in enrolling in the housing programs are assigned at random to a treatment group, who is offered a housing program slot, or to a control group, who are referred to other services in the community.  The goal is to enroll at least 900 individuals in the study. Outcomes will be measured over a 12-month follow-up period. The main outcomes to be measured are number of quarters employed during the follow-up period, employed in the last quarter of follow-up, relapse, and stability of housing at the end of the follow-up period."
