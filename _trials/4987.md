abstract: "Contemporary research on distributive justice assumes that close social relationships between individuals are critical for the prevalence of the need principle in a group. While recent empirical studies suggest that needs affect how groups distribute available payoffs, the group members’ social relationship has only been implicitly addressed by assuming that group members have sufficiently close relationships with each other for the need principle to appeal. In this study, we examine whether need satisfaction depends on the social relation between the group members in a controlled, laboratory experiment. By means of a group task, we create social proximity among group members. After the group task stage, participants are systematically matched into groups of three where they bargain over the distribution of a joint, exogenously given endowment. The group composition varies with respect to the proximity of social ties. We hypothesize that group members with closer social proximity are more likely to form coalitions and, therefore, are more likely to satisfy each other’s needs. Evidence supporting the theoretical claim that the adherence to the need principle depends on the type of social relationship, contributes to identifying the scope of need-based justice and systemizing the domains of different distributive justice norms."
