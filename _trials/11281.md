abstract: "In various economic situations, people assess others and are often willing to lie to benefit other individuals. This could be due to pure altruism or reciprocity, that is to say, people lie for others hoping the others will pay them back in the future. This can be problematic in settings such as science, where peer review systems are considered the cornerstone of research assessment. While peer review is nominally anonymous, in practice anonymity is very hard to preserve, especially in relatively small domains. We examine the existence and magnitude of such a “reciprocal lying” effect."
