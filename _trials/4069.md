abstract: "This study aims to understand the dynamic relationship between intra-household bargaining and women's consumption decisions. We want to test whether the share of the household budget over which a woman has control is a function of her prior investment decisions and whether these reputation concerns lead women to avoid risky and hide bad decisions. We use a series of lab-in-the-field experiments to test (1) whether husband transfers vary with the salience of the wife’s ability to manage the budget; (2) whether wives are willing to play a game that will potentially send a signal about their performance to their husbands, and whether and how much they are willing to pay a cost to hide signals of poor performance; and (3) whether wives’ willingness to invest varies with the husband’s perception of the cost and the risk of the investment.
