abstract: "We study how exogenous variation in inflation uncertainty perceived by households affects their expectations and spending decisions. We use randomized information treatments that provide different types of information about the first and/or second moments of the Bank of Canada's inflation target, its outlook on inflation, and the inflation forecasts of professional forecasters to generate exogenous changes in the perceived inflation uncertainty of some households. The effects on their expectations and spending decisions relative to an untreated control group are measured immediately and in a follow-up survey."
