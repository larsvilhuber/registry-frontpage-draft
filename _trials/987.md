abstract: "With the increasing individualization and insecurity of the Dutch pension system, the responsibility for a sufficient pension lies more and more with the pension fund participant. In order to make a decision on whether future pension benefits are sufficient or whether to take additional measures to save for retirement, participants need to have accurate information on the status quo. However, interest in pension communication has been found to be low. Through an experiment where the content of letters is slightly changed per treatment group, we will analyse which manner of communication is most effective in increasing pension awareness. Our main dependent variable is whether participants visit the new website of the pension fund and log in. Furthermore, we are able to see whether different groups of participants react differently to treatments and whether the behavior on the website changes per treatment. Younger participants might react more often to the lottery treatment than older participants. The lottery treatment might lead to more people logging in, while it also might have the consequence that people spend less time to inform themselves.
