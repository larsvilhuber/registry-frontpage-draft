abstract: "Our study investigates the impact of redistribution and its perceived fairness on individual cooperation. In a controlled experiment, participants are randomly allocated to groups of four individuals, with each group subject to varying treatment conditions. These groups are characterized by distinct redistribution rules and levels of meritocracy associated with the incentivized tasks they undertake. The impact of these treatments on cooperation is subsequently measured using a public goods game. We hypothesize that groups subjected to higher levels of redistribution exhibit increased cooperation, i.e., higher levels of contribution. Moreover, this effect tends to diminish if the fairness of the redistribution is perceived as low. The research aims to shed light on how redistribution systems can shape individual cooperative behaviour and to explore the underlying mechanisms of any such relationship."
