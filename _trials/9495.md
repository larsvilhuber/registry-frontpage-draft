abstract: "In our study we focus on the job selection effect of corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. We investigate if rather ethical or unethical people are attracted by employers that promote CSR. In a field experiment on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk), we therefore act as an employer who is looking for workers to complete a job. Our experiment consists of two parts. In the first part we focus on finding out about the participant's general ethical predisposition by testing whether they have social preferences when confronted with a situation where they can lie without being caught. In the second part, we then offer the participants a job, where we vary whether or not they receive information about the employer's CSR activities and observe if they accept the job. With the results we are able to identify if employers that promote CSR activities in their job description attract not just rather honest or dishonest employees but people who lie for pro-social reasons or not. A secondary outcome of interest is the behavior of the participants on the job. Since the design of the experiment gives participants the opportunity to misbehave on the job, by misreporting whether they completed the assigned task, we can analyze how rather honest and rather dishonest employees behave on the job and whether an employer's CSR activities have an influence on it."
