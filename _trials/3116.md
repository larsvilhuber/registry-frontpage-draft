abstract: "After long years of confrontation between armed groups and increased urban violence, Colombia must filled the left holes in order to overcome the negative consequences of this former reality. A crucial challenge faced by policymakers in Colombia is to promote and enhance a culture of peace.  Education has proven to be an effective path to attain this goal; it helps to transform misconceptions and develop skills and knowledge that can create peaceful relationships from early years of life in spite of any violent context. Since 2003, the Ministry of Education have been working on establishing a culture of peace in the country. Even though different interventions have been applied, experimental evidence about their effectiveness is limited. Along with the Ministry of Education, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of a specialized teacher’s training on student's citizenship competencies. By changing the learning environments at the school, the program ("Modelo de Formación para la Ciudadanía: estrategias que contribuyen a educar para la paz or MFC") seeks to build and consolidate, along with teachers and school staff, strategies that enhance citizenship competencies in students for the exercise of human rights. The program was implemented in public schools located in municipalities prioritized for post-conflict programs.  "
