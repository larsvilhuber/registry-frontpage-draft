abstract: "We contrast two fundamental ways to learn and form expectations for businesses. On the one hand, we will provide evidence on firms’ ability to adapt through feedback, sometimes also called “local search” or “adaptive expectations”. This approach primarily reactive in nature. 
On the other hand, we will investigate the effectiveness of proactive learning and experimentation, an approach that is connected to concepts such as “hypothesis-driven search” and “anticipatory expectations”. "
