abstract: "This proposal aims at testing for bias in redistribution preferences. Using a laboratory labor market experiment, we can test whether preferences are influenced by experience with taxes and redistribution. The support for taxes is low and decreasing worldwide. Moreover, the top tax rates dropped substantially since the 80s, signaling a reference for a lower redistribution rate. This contradicts survey experiments that either show indifference toward income inequality or that rising inequality increases the claimed support for redistribution. Using an incentive-compatible voting mechanism on the level of taxes and redistribution, we use a laboratory experiment can identify the effect of changes in an individual's role (net payer or receiver) on their preferences about redistribution.
