abstract: "Knowledge sharing within firms could emerge as a result of human capital spillovers and agglomeration (Lucas Jr, 1988) or interaction among peers (Krugman, 1991). The literature documents that a larger group with better skills is more likely to have the opportunity to exchange ideas, thus increasing knowledge sharing and resulting in an overall larger production outcomes at the group level.  However, measuring the effects of interaction using observational data may be subject to selection bias. 
While event studies and instrumental strategies have helped establish the importance of intra-group interactions for economic growth, the mechanisms through which social interactions affect knowledge diffusion and productivity remain ambiguous.\\ 
This study aims at filling this knowledge gap by leveraging a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) that will be embedded in a longitudinal study, and will involve approximately 2,000 women in the Indian State of Chhattisgarh. In collaboration with the Chhattisgarh State Rural Livelihood Mission (CGSRLM), we will encourage the creation of new firms  through the Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and Village-Level Organization (VLOs) network set up by CGSRLM in rural villages. Importantly, we will randomize the size of these business groups and will administer business training to all groups via smartphones.

Our experimental design allows us to carefully study: 

        1) How new knowledge diffuses within firms sorted by size;

        2) How firmsâ€™ production and growth process are impacted by the diffusion of new knowledge.

The RCT and the longitudinal study will be used to assess the causal impact of and the mechanisms through which interaction affects knowledge diffusion and firm growth. Detailed information on individual characteristics, social networks and interactions collected via three rounds of socioeconomic surveys (baseline, midline and endline) will allow us to quantitatively assess how firm members interact with each other, exchange information and make decisions. 
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to focus on how group size and group members' skill composition impact knowledge diffusion and group performance among small-medium firms. It is also the first study of its kind to encourage the creation of new businesses and to track them through time in order to assess their growth and sustainability. "
