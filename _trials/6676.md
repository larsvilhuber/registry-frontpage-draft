abstract: "We investigate the role of memory in how individuals form probabilistic beliefs. In particular, we present subjects with a series of images with multiple features (content vs color). We measure how beliefs about the distribution of these features vary depending on both normatively relevant and normatively irrelevant features of the distribution of images. We plan to connect these results to a model of memory to explain why sometimes people hold too extreme of beliefs, while at other times beliefs appear to be too conservative."
