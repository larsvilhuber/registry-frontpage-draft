abstract: "We conduct an intervention designed to increase savings for small business owners in Kampala, Uganda. Many business owners in developing countries are saving constrained. Interventions are typically designed to increase savings by providing access to bank account or other ways to physically store money. In contrast, we build on a behavioral approach and combine strategies for pursuing goals with strategies of planning out oneâ€™s goal pursuit. During our intervention participants set business savings goals and reflect about why they want to reach these goals. Following this, they make specific plans on how to reach these. They fill out a calendar with specific amounts of money and specific date on which they want to save to reach this goal. Following this, participants are encouraged to think about obstacles that may stop them from saving as planned. They are further encouraged to think about ways to overcome these obstacles. The control group is given a similar calendar, but are not prompted to fill this calendar. The baseline questionnaire and the intervention were conducted in April/May 2018, the follow-up survey takes place in September/October 2018. "
