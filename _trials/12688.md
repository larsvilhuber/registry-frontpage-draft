abstract: "We study choices about pie sharing in dyadic interaction with varying responder veto power. We consider a condition with fixed pie size (baseline) and two conditions with endogenously determined pie size (high and low efficiency loss conditions). We analyse baseline and efficiency loss conditions within subjects. We vary the order of conditions and the extent of the efficiency loss between subjects. We use the strategy vector method to elicit subjects' choices."
