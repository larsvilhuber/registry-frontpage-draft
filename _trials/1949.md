abstract: "It is a well-known fact that regular exercise has positive health consequences. Whether exercise also affects other important outcomes, such as academic performance, is however still an open question. We therefore designed a field experiment that was implemented in collaboration with the University of Bergen (UIB), Bergen City College (HIB), and the Student Gym in Bergen (SIB). We randomly assigned  students from UIB and HIB that were not members of the student gym to either a treatment group that were encouraged to start exercising at the student gym in the spring semester 2016, or a control group that did not get any encouragement. The participants granted us access to the complete grade transcripts from university from the time they started higher education until June 2018 and the complete exercise records at SIB. The high-quality administrative data thus allows us to analyze whether the intervention affected exercise and in turn academic performance, both in the short run and in the long run."
