abstract: "The improvements in the treatment of mental disorders have led to a decrease in the use of hospital services, which has been replaced by a community-focused approach. Even if this new approach has been able to improve the quality of life of people suffering from mental disorders, this has also implied a greater co-responsibility for those relatives who need to take care of the ill person. Moreover, in those cases in which relative caregivers do not have enough information and personal skills to provide a correct support to the patient, this new approach can derive into a worsening in the quality of life both for the person with the mental disorder and its caregiver. 

In the benchmark of the project Activa't (Get Active!), promoted by the Catalan government, Federació Salut Mental Catalunya and Federació Veus, a randomly selected group of 120 families with a person with mental disorders will be offered threefold support services for the patient and its main caregiver. Firstly, a training program including a psychoeducational module for care givers and another one for affected people. Secondly, a program aimed at empowering both the people affected by mental disorders and their caregivers to become active health agents. And finally, providing continued support to families through peer support groups. The program offers also an individualized space aimed at providing guidance and counseling services to the families. This space manages and coordinates all the training program and peer support groups.

By empowering themselves and their families, this program aims at helping patients with mental disorders to move forward in their recovery, as well as reducing the care burden for their family. "
