abstract: "This trial aims to measure the impact of a financial education programme for elementary school students in Brazil. The programme consists of training for teacher and school managers and offering classroom material that presents financial education content transversally to 3 regular disciplines: Mathematics, Portuguese and Human Sciences. Sampling and randomization were made at the school level from a list of schools who had enrolled in the programme. A total of 783 schools were randomly assigned to 2 treatment arms: control and treatment. The study will measure the proficiency in financial literacy for students in 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th grades analysed by IRT (item response theory). Tests were produced specifically for the Programme using a reference matrix for financial literacy for each grade evaluated pre and post intervention."
