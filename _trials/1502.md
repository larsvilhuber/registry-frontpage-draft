abstract: "We study political economy responses to a large scale intervention in Bangladesh, where
four sub-districts consisting of 100 villages (12,000 households) were randomly assigned
to control, information or subsidy treatments to encourage investments in improved
sanitation. In theory, leaders may endogenously respond to large interventions by
changing their allocation of effort, and their constituents’ views about the leader may
rationally change as a result. In one intervention where the leaders’ role in program
allocation was not clear to constituents, constituents appear to attribute credit to their
local leader for a randomly assigned program. However, when subsidy assignment
is clearly and transparently random, the lottery winners do not attribute any extra
credit to the politician relative to lottery losers. The theory can rationalize these
observations if we model leaders’ actions and constituent reactions under imperfect
information about leader ability. A third intervention returns to program villages to
inform a subset of subsidy recipients that the program was run by NGOs using external
funds. This eliminates the excess credit that leaders received from treated households
after the first intervention. These results suggest that while politicians may try to take
credit for development programs, it is not easy for them do so. Political accountability
is not easily undermined by development aid."
