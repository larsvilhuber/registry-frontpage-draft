abstract: "This is a harmonized correspondence study on employer hiring in Finland and the UK, to compare gender differences with parental status the treatment effect. The over-arching research question has two dimensions. First, this study evaluates whether there are gender differences in relative positive callback rates for parents versus childless married individuals at an early stage of the hiring process, and if they differ across low-, medium- and high-skill occupations. Second, it uses a comparative design to generalize results across two diverse country contexts in terms of institutional support gender employment equality and maternal employment in particular. We select the same three gender-neutral occupations for analysis in each labor market, harmonizing education and work experience in each across the countries. After the start of fielding in both countries, however, the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns had dramatic effects on the labor markets. We therefore added a new facet of assessing whether the lower demain exacerbated discrimination against mothers and favoring fathers."
