abstract: "In partnership with the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), the Behavioural Economics Team of the Australian Government (BETA) is conducting research to improve cyber security advice for individuals in their personal lives.
Individuals can protect themselves and reduce their risk of becoming victims of cyber attacks by implementing certain behaviours. In particular, using strong and different passwords across important accounts, and regularly updating their devicesâ€™ software.
The study involves a survey with embedded framed field experiment. The survey aims to gain deeper insight into cyber security attitudes, awareness, and current practices. The embedded survey experiment aims to examine which ways of presenting information might result in the most significant change to intentions and behaviours. "
