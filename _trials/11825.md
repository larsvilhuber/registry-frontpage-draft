abstract: "Connecting rural unserved, virgin communities with latent demand for retail digital financial services (DFS) is an important first order policy and commercial question. Perhaps, more important and distinct is our ability to improve the new markets once communities are connected. This project addresses major gaps in research about connecting rural, unserved communities to markets for retail DFS with (i) original data collection — on household, community, and business outcomes — and (ii) a multi-year community-level field experiment testing a scalable approach to retail agent expansions, VSLAs-as-agents. We follow the success of our 2019/2020 detailed pilot work to launch a full RCT in rural Sierra Leone—a market environment that is poorly studied—to answer the following two research questions:

1) RQ1. What are the broader, general equilibrium impacts of connecting unserved, virgin communities with retail DFS?
2) RQ2. Once connected, could letting consumers evaluate their retailers improve the quality of services, consumer usage, and business outcomes, and if so, how?

In a unique collaboration with Catholic Agency for Overseas Development (CAFOD), Orange Money, GT Bank, and Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) - Sierra Leone, we implement a large-scale community-level field experiment that encourage Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLAs) to set up and operate as retail DF agents across rural unserved communities in Sierra Leone — a market environment that is poorly studied. Agents are established to offer both mobile money (via Orange Money) and bank services (via GT Bank) in 3 separate phases that span 2022-2024. This is an environment where the penetration of DFS is extremely low and retail agents are “non-existent” in these rural communities, but with latent demand and supply for DFS."
