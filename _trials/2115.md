abstract: "In response to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) passing legislation to improve the affordability and efficiency of health care delivery in the U.S., the researcher aims to focus on two choices that individuals tend to make: 1) decision to take-up coverage and 2) choice of health plan. The challenges that the researcher analyze are individuals' propensities to 1) choose less generous but more expensive plans, 2) not transparent provider networks. The researcher proposes two studies in particular: 1) Plan Choice Study that identifies key factors affecting plan choice in Covered California (California's health insurance marketplace) by providing easily comparable price and provider network information on plane choice and implications in regard to consumer welfare, market price elasticity and risk selection and 2) take-up study, which identifies key determinants of take-up of coverage in the individual health insurance exchange by estimating the impact of providing information on subsidies, political narrative and potential penalties.
