abstract: "This project introduces time as an incentive for performance. Depending on the treatment and the performance subjects can leave earlier. Treatments vary in the time and money domain. Importantly, the individual valuation of time (opportunity costs of time) is also elicited. Results can have important methodological implication for experimental economics and for settings outside the laboratory where it is possible to think about situations in which not only time incentives have advantages over monetary incentives, but also create different additional effects."
