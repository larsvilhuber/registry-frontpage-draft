abstract: "Chronic health conditions affect most older adults. Preventative medicine and risk management strategies, especially when applied earlier in life, are essential to altering the trajectory of a disease and ultimately improving health outcomes. Primary care providers (PCP) often provide most of these services, though younger adults are the least likely to receive primary care. This project leverages a period of high engagement and health activation during an individual's life (pregnancy) to nudge her toward use of primary care after the pregnancy episode. This randomized controlled trial will test the hypothesis that a behavioral science-informed intervention, incorporating defaults and salience, can increase rates of follow-up with a PCP after a delivery for individuals with hypertension, diabetes, obesity and mental illness. If successful, this
intervention could serve as a scalable solution to increase primary care use and preventative health services in a population that currently has low rates of engagement and utilization of these services."
