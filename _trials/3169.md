abstract: "This research investigates whether the effective use of mathematics textbooks structured to increase academic learning time improves learning outcome of students of primary and lower secondary education in El Salvador or not. This study targets for the 2nd and the 7th grades students in El Salvador. Cognitive skills of knowing, application and reasoning on all the domains of mathematics are measured by paper test. The students' attitude for learning of mathematics are measured by questionnaire. This study also evaluates whether mentoring and review of teaching practice enhance the behavioral change of teachers on the effective use of the textbooks. The heterogeneity of impact on learning outcome by intervention on students with lower academic performance at the baseline, and with fewer assets at home will be examined. 

The textbook and the related material such as teachers' guidebook and exercise book are developed by the Government of El Salvador with technical cooperation by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The mathematics textbooks divided subject contents and put them in appropriate sequence to assure small-step learning by students. The textbooks are also designed to change the time-use by increasing students' work of problem solving and pair learning in class and teachers' support for students. 

As the textbooks are developed from 1st to 12th grade, it is expected to generate cumulative impact for students who use the textbook continuously in grades. Field survey of this study is planned to be continued for two years in 2018 and 2019 to examine the cumulative impact on students of treatment group, compared to students of the control group who use the textbook only for 1 year in 2019.
