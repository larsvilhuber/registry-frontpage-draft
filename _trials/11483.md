abstract: "Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are frequently viewed as a tool for democratizing education and job training. However, their effectiveness is largely untested. The existing evidence of the value of online courses is generally based on observational data where the selection of unobservable characteristics is a major concern (see e.g., Castaño-Muñoz and Rodrigues, 2021; Hadavand, 2018).

To address this issue, we carry out a randomized controlled experiment in Costa Rica in which the treatment group received cost-free access to Coursera MOOCs and certificates. Additionally, treated individuals were assigned to one of two behavioural intervention arms, where they either received light-touch reminders, or personalised reminders. 

We are primarily interested in investigating three main questions: (i) What is the profile of the individuals who complete a course?; (ii) Is a more comprehensive, personalized reminder more effective in increasing course completion than a standardized email reminder?; and (iii) What are the labour market effects of completing a Coursera MOOC? To better understand the third question, we also analyse the heterogeneity of the treatment effects and study the impact of treatment on educational outcomes. "
