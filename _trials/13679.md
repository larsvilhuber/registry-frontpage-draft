abstract: "People may expect gender biases in contexts where there is none, and such biased expectations may be consequential. We design an experiment to test whether inaccurate beliefs about the existence of gender biases may cause employers to favor men employees. Our experiment has three groups of agents: experts, experts’ employers, and customers. The employers’ task is to hire either a man or a woman expert with identical credentials. The employers’ payoff depends on the customers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for the expert’s service (advice). Hence, the employers’ expected payoff, and therefore the payoff from their hiring decision, depends on their expectations of customers’ WTP for advice from a woman versus a man expert. Customers may buy expert advice in an incentivized Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) auction, to help with their task in the experiment. The customers’ task is to predict the inflation rate in the U.S. economy, and the customer whose prediction is the most accurate gains a relatively large monetary reward. The payoffs of the employers in the experiment are designed to eliminate the existence of altruistic motives for hiring experts, and we control for other potential mechanisms causing employers to favor any particular gender, beyond beliefs about gender biases amongst customers.
