abstract: "The COVID-19 epidemic has demanded societal behavioral change in order to slow the spread of the disease. Yet, governments have struggled to guarantee compliance with social-distancing rules and norms. Following previous literature on the effect of text messages on promoting healthy behavior, the city of São Paulo has implemented a (SMS) text message intervention aimed at encouraging people to stay at home, wear face masks, and maintain a safe distance from others. The intervention will be evaluated through a randomized control trial with 76,324 participants, stratified by gender and neighborhood. Participants were randomly selected from the e-government platform (SP156) database that initially contained 755,585 records, and assigned to one of six arms: five treatment arms and one control arm in which participants do not receive any messages. After the text messages were sent, citizens will be contacted on their cellphones to answer a phone survey designed to measure beliefs, awareness, and self-reported behavior related to the epidemic This document describes the design of the intervention, with a particular focus on the content of messages and experimental approach used in the study, and presents a plan for analysis of the follow-up telephone survey that will measure attitudes and behaviors related to the epidemic."
