abstract: "The goal of this study is to estimate the effects of treating Major Depressive Disorder ("Depression") on economic behavior. The study follows up on two recently-completed randomized control trials of low-cost psychotherapy to treat depression in Goa, India, conducted by the NGO Sangath and led by Professor Vikram Patel. We will study the impact of the treatments (and the resulting reduced levels of depression) on beliefs, preferences and decision-making, and other economic outcomes."
