abstract: "This study examines the impact of an information treatment on breastfeeding and infant illness as the primary outcomes as well as maternal and child well-being more broadly as secondary outcomes. The aim is to study the causal effect of breastfeeding promotion on infant illness in a developed context with low rates of infection. For this purpose, we plan to recruit around 6,000 new or expectant mothers in WeChat groups in China. To a random subsample, we will show a video that encourages breastfeeding, especially leveraging the fact that incorrect information about breastfeeding during the Corona pandemic is arguably present in China.
