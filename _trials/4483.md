abstract: "The project studies whether there exist search frictions in fragmented rural labor markets in Tanzania and the extent to which search frictions constrain an efficient allocation of labor within village. This project aims to test these hypotheses by offering a digital labor market technology: job information sharing via automated text messages. 

An automated SMS app that connects agricultural employers and workers is offered in randomly selected villages. Employers in treatment villages can request for casual workers for agricultural tasks via SMS, and the workers within the specified boundary receive the job ad with summarized job details. Workers can apply to the job, which is instantly forwarded to the original employer who posted the job ad. "
