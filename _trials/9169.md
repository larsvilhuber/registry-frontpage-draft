abstract: "In collaboration with the Uganda Revenue Authority, I randomize the sending of text messages and message content to potential taxpayers for the 2018-19 fiscal year. Specifically, the sample include registered tax-payers who have previously paid either Uganda's presumptive or personal income tax in any fiscal year since 2014-2015. I randomize between a control group (no message), a group which receives a simple reminder (inform), a group which receives a message about the benefits of taxation (encourage), and a group which receives a message focusing on the penalties for non-compliance (enforce). I use administrative data from URA to measure the effects of the intervention on tax compliance itself."
