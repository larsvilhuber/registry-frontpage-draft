abstract: "In the present study I conduct a controlled online experiment investigating choice-set effects in fairness decisions. Specifically, I look at range based choice-set effects. That is, the effects of expanding the range of one choice dimension. I use a spectator design with between-subject treatment to expand the range in one dimension of a fairness decision by adding a decoy alternative. Thus, I am able to causally infer how expanding the range of a choice dimension in a fairness decision affects the preference relation between the original alternatives in a choice set. "
