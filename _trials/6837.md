abstract: "We present causal evidence on the effects of six different text message-based agricultural information programs implemented in Kenya and Rwanda. All programs shared similar objectives, but were implemented by three different organizations and varied in terms of content, design, and target population, which allows us to learn about the extent of impact heterogeneity.
