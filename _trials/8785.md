abstract: "Using a laboratory experiment, we analyze whether freedom of choice or high wages induce higher work effort. In our gift exchange experiment, participants have to work on one of three different real effort tasks. After a trial round, participants are either assigned to a task or they are able to choose their preferred task themselves (freedom of choice). Furthermore, they either receive a normal wage or an unexpected wage increase (high wages). The wage increase equals the mean willingness-to-accept (WTA) to sell one’s decision right. The WTA is determined in a pre-study with a different group of participants. After having completed the real effort task, we ask the participants whether they are willing to work on another task that is beneficiary to the experimenter without receiving additional compensation. Given the evidence of other gift exchange experiments, we conjecture that both freedom of choice and high wages lead to an increase in voluntary work provision compared to a baseline scenario without any of these two incentives. Which of the two gifts induces more effort, however, is an open question that we want to answer. "
