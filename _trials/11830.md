abstract: "Discrimination against minority groups is a widespread social issue with profound implications for individuals and society. Extensive research has shown that discrimination based on attributes like race, gender, or religion is present in various sectors of society. However, most studies focus on specific subgroups, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of discrimination within the general population. We address this gap by conducting a large-scale other-other allocation task with a representative sample of the German population. Our project aims to study the extent of discrimination against Turkish migrants from the general population while controlling for other potential confounding factors."
