abstract: "
The Resilient Economic Development gains (RED) program will be implemented by Save the Children in rural villages in the Zomba district of Malawi. The 5-year multifaceted program will focus on improving child health and developing the resilience capacity of Malawian households through a package of interventions that target livelihood strengthening and diversification as well as education. The evaluation is designed to test the impacts of the full package of interventions in treatment clusters (groups of villages) relative to control clusters.
