abstract: "In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the most marginalized people often live furthest from the city center and face expensive commutes to access economic opportunities and services. Transit incentives may improve the well-being of of vulnerable populations who otherwise would forgo welfare enhancing trips like healthcare visits and job search opportunities. This study takes advantage of a significant upcoming reform in the transit subsidy policy of Bogotá, which will considerably modify its eligible population, to assess the effects of targeted transit incentives, under imperfect take-up, on mobility, access to healthcare services and job opportunities, as well as effects on overall indicators of well-being such as income, food security and psychological well-being."
