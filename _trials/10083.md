abstract: "Despite easily accessible information about the negative health externalities of environmental pollution, households' marginal willingness to pay for environmental quality is surprisingly low. In light of this puzzle, we design a large-scale online experiment to better understand individuals' attitudes towards air pollution-related information. We focus on two mechanisms: information avoidance and memory retention. In addition, we test whether an increase in perceived control over one's own health outcomes reduces failures to attend to information. To do so, participants in the experiment are asked whether they would like to acquire information about the number of life-years lost in their home region due to air pollution. Before participants make their decision, we exogenously increase participants' perceived control over the negative effect of air pollution on their own health, in half of the sample. After indicating their choice, participants either receive information about the number of life-years lost in their county or no information at all, based on a random draw. Participants who do receive information are then asked to recall the number of life-years lost in their county (i) shortly after receiving it and (ii) after two weeks."
