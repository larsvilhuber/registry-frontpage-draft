abstract: "Background: In the context of a 3ie funded impact study assessing the use of SMS reminders in improving retention and adherence to antiretroviral therapy, we descriptively examined the stability of preferences (time, risk, altruism) and subjective wellbeing among people living with HIV in Burkina Faso. More specifically, from the larger impact study we randomly selected a sub-sample of 400 individuals to participate in a phone survey measuring preferences (incentivized with telephone credit). Of the 400 initially sampled individuals, 336 completed four rounds of choice experiments covering altruism, risk and time preferences along with further survey questions. 

Research Aim: We are registering a trial as a follow-up to the above, descriptive study. We study the impact of cash transfers on preferences as well as subjective well-being. Some patients were randomly chosen to receive unconditional cash transfers over a 6 month period (treatment group 1 receives monthly transfers, treatment group 2 receives one equivalent large transfer at the end). We will follow up with two surveys to assess impacts. The baseline survey is the last round of the previous descriptive study. We register the intervention and study before the collection of follow-up data. Our main research question is: What are the impacts of unconditional cash transfers on preferences and well-being indicators? Relatedly, are a regular or a one-time transfer equally impactful?
