abstract: "We investigate whether individual perceptions of the origin of immigrants are linked to economic concerns about immigration in the host society. In our experiment, participants are randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups: two treatment arms and a passive control group. While respondents in the first treatment arm are only subject to belief elicitation employed as a priming device, respondents in the second treatment arm are exposed to factual information about the overall share of immigrants in their society as well as the share of immigrants stemming from European countries. Conversely, the passive control group is neither exposed to factual information nor the priming device. We aim to analyze whether information provision and/or the priming treatment translate into economic concerns about immigration, immigration policy preferences and preferences for redistribution."
