abstract: "Settlement through mediation is a crucial mechanism for dispute resolution. However, the eﬀectiveness of mediation can vary signiﬁcantly based on case characteristics. This study develops an artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) model that predicts mediation success probability in small-loan disputes. We plan to conduct a ﬁeld experiment in collaboration with a mediation center in China, investigating whether and how the use of AI predictions inﬂuences mediation behavior and mediation results. AI predictions of mediation success probability will be introduced in the treatment group. 
This research contributes to the growing literature on AI’s applications in the judicial settings and provides empirical evidence on how predictive analytics can affect dispute resolution."
