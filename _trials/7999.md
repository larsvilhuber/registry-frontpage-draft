abstract: "This study examines the role of inspirational goal reminders. We collaborated with a major Nordic organization to conduct a field experiment with full-time employees. The employees in the treatment group received inspirational goal reminders—communication of goals that are marginally higher than the status quo—of their sales targets via cellular text messages. The employees in the control condition did not receive any reminders. We also tracked employee’s goal-progress-monitoring activities. We randomly selected the treatment and control groups across Sweden.
