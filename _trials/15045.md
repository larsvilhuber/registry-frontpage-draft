abstract: "The Treasury is advising the government on its responses to the ACCC’s Retail Deposits Inquiry and Home Loan Price Inquiry. Despite the financial benefits that can result from switching products, the reports found a lack of consumer engagement in these markets. For both markets the ACCC recommended that prompts be considered encouraging consumers to see if they could benefit from switching to alternative products that might better suit their needs.  

BETA is working with the Treasury to: (1) identify the relevant behavioural factors in consumer financial decision-making; (2) understand the utility of prompts; (3) determine the optimal design for the prompts proposed in the ACCC reports; and (4) understand the barriers and enablers consumers experience when switching or repricing to identify additional interventions which may complement, or be an alternative to, the use of prompts.  

BETA is conducting a suite of research activities to support this work, including a field trial (‘trial’) in partnership with a large retail bank. This trial will specifically test a single prompt designed to encourage disengaged customers to engage with their bank to negotiate a better deal on their home loan. This will provide evidence informing the effectiveness of prompts to encourage engagement in a relatively disengaged cohort. 

Trial Aims 
The aim of the trial is to test the effectiveness of a prompt to encourage disengaged customers to call the bank to see if they are eligible to receive a lower interest rate on their loan.
