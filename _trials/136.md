abstract: "While much has been written about the potential benefits of mentoring in academia, very little research documents its effectiveness. We use a randomized controlled trial to evaluate a mentoring program for female economists organized by the Committee for the Status of Women in the Economics Profession (CSWEP) and sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the American Economics Association. We have evaluated the performance of three cohorts of participants and randomly-assigned controls from 2004, 2006, and 2008. Ongoing work continues the evaluation of longer term outcomes for these three cohorts and investigates outcomes for three additional cohorts--2010, 2012, and 2014.  Our interim assessment of the programâ€™s effects for the first three cohorts suggests that mentoring works. After five years the 2004 treatment group averaged .4 more NSF or NIH grants and 3 additional publications, and were 25 percentage points more likely to have a top-tier publication. There are significant but smaller effects at three years post-treatment for the 2004 and 2006 cohorts combined. While it was too early to assess the ultimate effects of mentoring on the academic careers of program participants from these cohorts, the results suggest that this type of mentoring may be one way to help women advance in the Economics profession and, by extension, in other male-dominated academic fields."
