abstract: "Approximately 30% of workers in the Indian constructions sector report some form of forced labor risk (Global Fund to End Modern-day Slavery, 2021). Micro-contractors (MCs) are often the first point of contact for workers on a construction site and play a major role in determining their working conditions. They have direct influence over forced labor indicators, such as workers' freedom of movement at work, their debt to their employer, the payment of their wages, work hours, overtime, and others. However, MCs themselves also face a host of challenges in their daily operations, such as delayed payments from builders, limited access to low-cost working capital, inconsistent work orders, informal business management, and problems in sourcing and retaining workers. This study randomizes MCs into an experimental group (180 MCs) that is given access to low-cost loans, and a control group (70 MCs) without access. We measure the impact of access to loans on forced labor indicators in the workers under these MCs."
