abstract: "We study the impact of peer-mentoring, meetings, and group compensation on worker performance in a field experiment. In collaboration with a mid-sized firm in several locations in the US, we grouped workers into four groups. All workers took a baseline survey and were paired with another worker. The first group is the control. The second treatment group entered a tournament where winners were the pairs with the greatest percent change in performance and were awarded a prize of $50 value. The third treatment group was given time to meet with their partner and given free lunch if they met. The fourth treatment group received both the peer-mentorship lunch incentive and the performance prize. We investigate the impact of these treatments on performance and turnover. Both peer-mentorship and group incentives provide mechanisms for knowledge spillovers and agglomeration effects. We measure the impact of the knowledge transfers in terms of changes in performance and retention. The comparisons across groups provide evidence on whether peer-mentorship and meetings are a substitute or complement to group compensation. Of particular interest is the heterogeneity across types of mentorship pairs in terms of (1) gender, (2) past performance, (3) tenure.  "
