abstract: "This project aims at combining policy evaluation of the New York congestion charge with the causal analysis of public support. The congestion charge in New York provides a unique opportunity to examine people's understanding of and support for congestion charges both before and after the implementation of the policy, compared to a control group. That is, it allows at the same time learning about the policy (policy evaluation) and learning about how voters learn about the policy and potentially revise their beliefs accordingly (causal analysis of public support). Policymakers are likely to care about both items and to be more likely to experiment with ex-ante unpopular policies in presence of not only more evidence about their effectiveness, but also about their potential ex-post popularity. The New York congestion charge also provides the ideal framework to examine the role of information provision as a substitute, and complement, to experience and to understand mechanisms explaining potential changes in public support."
