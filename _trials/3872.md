abstract: "This randomized controlled trial evaluates a three-year program promoting pulse cultivation in five districts of Northern Bihar, India, through four local implementing partners. In response to the political imperative to address the growing trade deficit in pulses by augmenting domestic supplies, the program has proposed to develop and pilot a package of interventions aimed at increasing take-up and productivity of pulses farming in the region, with the potential for future replication and scale-up. The UC Davis research team aims to evaluate the program’s impacts on pulse production, welfare and nutrition of the farmers (and their households) targeted by the AKF intervention."
