abstract: "Due to the war in Northern Uganda between the 1980s and mid-2000s, thousands of girls were severely victimized, including through abductions for the purpose of forced labor and early marriages. This project examines the impact of interventions targeting women who, as children, were affected by these experiences. In collaboration with a local NGO, we implement a randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving over 800 women in the war-affected Kitgum district of Uganda. The majority of the women in the sample were abducted as children by the Lord Resistance Army (LRA) during the war. In summer 2024, the women were randomly assigned to one of four groups: 1) a control group; 2) a group receiving weekly cash transfer for 14 weeks (T1); 3) a group receiving weekly cash transfers plus group-based coaching on intra-household relationships, parenting, health and nutrition practices (T2); 4) a group receiving weekly cash transfers plus group-based mental health counseling (T3). We assess the impact of the interventions on economic outcomes, mental health indicators, measures of social support, and measures of intra-household decision-making, including bargaining and conflict.
