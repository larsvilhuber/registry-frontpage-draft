abstract: "The SheepToShip LIFE project aims to enhance the contribution of the sheep sector - from sheep farming to processing milk and dairy products - towards the achievement of EU climate change targets. By developing and promoting innovative and eco-sustainable production models, SheepToShip LIFE aims to meet its overall objective of reducing by 20% in 10 years greenhouse gas emissions from the Sardinian sheep farming sector and dairy supply chain. 

Our goal with this experimental random control treatment is to investigate the influence of social norms on the purchase behavior of Sardinian dairy product consumers."
