abstract: "This project intends to use laboratory experiments to study how economic integration and relative country sizes affect competition between two intrinsically worthless currencies as media of exchange. We design the experiments to implement a two-country, two-currency search model based on the theoretical work of Zhang (2014). In particular, in this project, we vary the degree of economic integration and relative country sizes. We then test the model's predictions on currency acceptance, trade, and welfare."
