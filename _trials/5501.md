abstract: "The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) provides cyber security advice to help make Australia the safest place to connect online. BETA is working with the ACSC to test novel ways to present information about cyber security advice in a way that best helps people and organisations to enact that advice.
The Stay Smart Online alert service is an email subscription that sends alerts whenever a major cyber incident has occurred. The aim of the alert service is to provide timely advice to members of the public either to prevent them from falling victim to the incident, or helping them to rectify the problem if they have been a victim, by providing advice and next steps. 
This trial aims to test the effect of different behavioural concepts to see email design elements increase the likelihood that people will engage with the advice, and share it with their friends and family."
