abstract: "This study will examine the business practices among small-sized retail firms in urban Jakarta using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) methodology. The project will have three main goals. First, we will characterize the business practices used by the retailers, identifying those that are potentially conducive to productivity growth, higher sales and profits. Second, we will disseminate the top performance-enhancing business practices among the retailers and will track the adoption of such business practices by retailers. Third, we will study the causal effect of adopting the business practices on business performance and growth. In order to distinguish informational and behavioral constraints to adoption of the practices, we will vary the ways in which the information is conveyed and implemented. To that end, we will make use of different framings as well as business role-models in the implementation of the practices."
