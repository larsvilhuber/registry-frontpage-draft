abstract: "Research has shown that asset bubbles, the fast-paced increase of asset prices above fundamental value, are robust to most intervention. The leading hypothesis as to why asset bubbles exist is the Irrational Trader Hypothesis, where traders are not using fundamental value to trade but some other heuristic. This experiment investigates this cause of bubbles through teams. These teams act as single trader in the asset market and can chat back and forth about their trading strategy. The chat messages offer insight into whether traders are truly irrational, or if not, what other actions cause these bubbles."
