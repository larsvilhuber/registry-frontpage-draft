abstract: "Part-time work (a work-time percentage below 90%) has increased significantly over the past thirty years in Switzerland, and while it is a phenomenon that interests both the male and the female labor force, it is more typically a characteristic of womenâ€™s working life (BFS, 2022). While providing the opportunity to pursue other activities, a part-time job may entail precarious working conditions, insufficient social security coverage (e.g., pension funds) and fewer opportunities for further education and training and career advancement. So far, it has not been systematically analyzed whether individuals are aware about the costs associated with part-time work choices and whether providing short, low-cost information can have causal effects on workload beliefs. 
In this study we aim to analyze in a survey experiment the causal effects of a short, low-cost randomized information intervention on the beliefs about part-time work. With our study we want to answer the following research questions: First, can a short information intervention on the short and long-term (opportunity) costs of working part-time affect the way people think about part-time work? Second, can we observe a difference in the decision made by female and male respondents?
