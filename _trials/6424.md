abstract: "This study was designed to examine the influence of increased funding for the parental participation program on learning outcomes, parent and teacher involvement, as well as dropout and failure rates. The parental participation program, also known as Apoyo a la Gestión Escolar (AGEs), or Support to School Management, is part of a larger Compensatory Education Project that is being implemented in the most marginalized municipalities of Mexico by the Government. There are two group-based parental involvement interventions on parent and teacher behaviors, and educational outcomes. Two trials were conducted across 430 public schools in states of Mexico with a large indigenous population. The first experiment provided financial resources to parent associations. The second experiment provided information to parent associations about how parents can become more involved in their children’s school. The data was collected by government contractors and administrative data come from the Government implementing agency."
