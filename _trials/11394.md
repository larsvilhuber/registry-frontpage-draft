abstract: "The Farmer Support Activity in Ghana seeks to reinforce resilience, preserve agricultural productivity, and enhance the awareness and capacity of smallholder farmers (SHFs) regarding good agronomic practices. The WFP Ghana Office implements a cash transfer programme to achieve these goals. Transfers are complemented by financial and agricultural sensitization activities. 

Transfers are worth a total of approx. 315 USD across installments and will reach around 17,000 SHFs in 163 communities across 17 districts in four regions of Ghana (Northern, North East, Upper East, and Upper West). The programme will be implemented from June to August 2023 during the planting season. 

Given that the size and frequency of transfers can influence decision-making patterns (including investment decisions), this impact evaluation will compare the effects of (a) receiving a lump-sum transfer versus (b) receiving three monthly payments on farmersâ€™ spending behavior during the planting season, which can ultimately affect their resilience and productivity. The total transfer size is held constant."
