abstract: "In Senegal, a significant share of adolescents who leave formal education before completing middle school seek to learn skills through informal apprenticeships, and young adults who have completed informal apprenticeships have more stable employment than similarly skilled youths who have not chosen this path. Despite its attractiveness among less educated youth, informal apprenticeship training in Senegal is characterized by low quality, long duration (five years on average) and a lack of certification. Neither the sectors involved, nor the apprenticeships are regulated, and so the content of the training depends only on a workshop’s activity, which varies considerably within trades. To improve skills transfers through the traditional apprenticeship system, the PEJA program (“Improving Youth Employability through Informal Apprenticeships”), implemented by the Ministry of Employment, Vocational Training, Apprenticeship and Integration (MFPAI), aims to standardize training, improve the breadth and depth of skills training, introduce certification processes for both apprentices and masters, and strengthen the capacity of crafts person professional associations. 

The PEJA project seeks to facilitate skills transfer to apprentices by providing equipment grants to master craftspersons, along with providing additional training (technical skills, business skills and socio-emotional skills) to craftspersons and apprentices alike, and then introducing additional incentives for apprentices to complete formal certification of their skills. The main beneficiaries are young informal apprentices, aged 15 to 25, and their masters. It is worth noting that the program does not place youth in workshops: beneficiaries are apprentices who have selected themselves into apprenticeships before the beginning of the program. The project targets urban areas, where traditional apprenticeships are more prevalent: it is implemented in the four departments of the Dakar region and in 15 regional capitals or economic hubs.

This experiment is conducted on the first wave of the implementation of the PEJA. Of the eight trades targeted by the first wave, our experiment focuses on five (Tailoring, woodwork, metalwork, auto mechanics, and hairdressing). It relies on two surveys (baseline and endline) and the random assignment to a treatment group.  "
