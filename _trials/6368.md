abstract: "In Germany, during their first meeting, the caseworker generally assesses job seekersâ€™ reemployment prospects and considers whether active labor market programs could help them find employment. At the end of the first meeting, job seekers usually sign a mandatory integration agreement with their caseworker, which is a written contract that specifies their rights and obligations in the job search process, such as the activities they are expected to complete. If the job seekers fail to comply with the contract, caseworkers can sanction them by reducing or cutting their unemployment benefits. There exists no causal evidence on the effectiveness of such contracts between caseworkers and unemployed job seekers. 

In this project we evaluate the impact of integration agreements on employment outcomes of newly unemployed individuals. Specifically, we randomize two aspects of the policy: the timing of the integration agreement (IA) and the advance notification of the IA. The timing of the IA is randomized as a function of the time since entry into unemployment. One treatment arm involves the IA in the first month, one involves the IA at 3 months, and one at 6 months. In addition, we randomize whether those assigned to receive the IA at 3 months also receive an advance notification of the timing of the future IA at 3 months, upon entry into unemployment. Together this enables us to analyze whether the timing of the IA affects individual labor market outcomes and whether the advance notification of the timing of a future IA has an impact.

We use rich administrative registers to observe outcomes and surveys among job seekers and caseworkers to assess the program."
