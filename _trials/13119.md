abstract: "To increase compliance with program rules, speed reemployment, and increase earnings, the Department of Laborâ€™s Reemployment and Eligibility Assessment Program (REA) provided funds to states to operate programs providing casework services to eligible Unemployment Insurance (UI) claimants. Previous evaluations had shown clear evidence that the REA program cuts UI durations and increases employment and earnings. How the REA program achieved those impacts was less clear. Candidate explanations included: (1) the assistance provided by caseworkers at the required REA meetings; (2) verification of compliance with UI program rules at the required REA meetings; and (3) penalties for failure to attend required REA meetings. To understand how the program achieved its impacts, the evaluation conducted four-armed random assignment. The four treatment conditions were: (1) Control; (2) Partial (minimal assistance); (3) Single (no more than one meeting); and (4) Multiple (more than one meeting, as per state policy). The evaluation was conducted separately in four states (Indiana, New York, Washington, and Wisconsin; with states varying in which treatment conditions they implemented) and randomly assigned nearly 250,000 UI claimants.
