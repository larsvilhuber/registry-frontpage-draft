abstract: "The gap in university enrolment by parental education is large and persistent in many countries. In this project, we investigate whether information about returns to university education can close the gap in aspired university attainment of adolescents in Germany. For that purpose, we implement a survey experiment among a representative sample of adolescents aged between 14 and 17 years, in which treatment group members are informed about average earnings by educational degree. By comparing responses between the uninformed control group and the informed treatment group, we aim to evaluate (i) whether information affects university aspirations per se and (ii) whether information affects the gap in aspirations by parental educational background.
