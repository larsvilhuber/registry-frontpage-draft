abstract: "In this study, we evaluate UNICEF's program “Improving Adolescent Lives in India”. The program's goal was to empower adolescents and make them “agents of change”' for themselves and their communities, simultaneously making their surrounding aware of their rights and needs. The Adolescent Empowerment Program (AEP) operates in four districts of four states (Sibsagar in Assam, Visakhapatanam in Andhra Pradesh, Puruliya and one Kolkata ward in West Bengal and East Singbhum in Jharkhand) and was set out to cover 50 percent of the adolescent population in each of these districts. Out of 82 program-eligible blocks 42 treatment blocks were allocated to receive the basic interventions and 40 blocks serve as a control group. In a second-stage, additional activities on top of the basic package were randomly allocated and assigned to certain villages within the treatment blocks: (a) additional parents groups initiated, (b) additional adolescent boys groups initiated, and/ or (c) additional parents and adolescents boys groups. In the evaluation this design corresponds to 120 villages in control blocks and 480 villages in the treatment blocks. We  capture a number of intermediate outcomes, such as on communication (inter- and intra-generational dialogue, as well as interpersonal communication competence), service provision (access to services over time, adolescent-friendly services, marriage service provision), and social norms and practices (on child marriage, child rights, equal opportunities). Finally, we are interested in indicators of adolescent empowerment (awareness on child rights, confidence, corporal punishment, self-efficacy, general well-being), child marriage rates and practices, engagement rates and practices, child pregnancy rates, as well as education attendance, and attitudes towards education."
