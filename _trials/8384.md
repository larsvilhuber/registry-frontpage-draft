abstract: "There has been much optimism about the potential of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to provide agricultural extension services to remote households. Yet, little is known about how different communication methods fare, and, moreover, whether different segments of the population adopt information communicated via different means equally. We conduct a randomized control trial comparing the effectiveness of three ICTs — radio, voice response messages, and a smartphone app — with a traditional extension training in communicating fertilizer management practices across four districts in rural Nepal."
