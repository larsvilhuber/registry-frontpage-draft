abstract: "In Peru, students have to invest an average of six months after finishing high school preparing themselves to get an admission into a flagship university. However, this investment does not assure success during freshman year. This also applies for low-income high-achiever students such as the beneficiaries of the Peruvian Scholarship Program financed by the Ministry of Education called “Beca 18”. This study aims to estimate the effects of using an artificially intelligent assessment and learning system on closing the gap between secondary and tertiary education for Beca 18 recipients. In particular, Beca 18 beneficiaries that begin college in august 2019 will be randomly assigned to receive a free license to take an online math course for 14 weeks. In addition, they will receive pedagogical and emotional support during this period. The main outcomes to be evaluated are: online math course use, math scores at the end of the course and GPA and dropout rates at the end of first term of college. Other outcomes to be assessed are: computer, internet and additional online courses use, non cognitive skills like grit, self-esteem, locus of control and social skills"
