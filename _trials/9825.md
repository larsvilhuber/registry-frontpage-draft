abstract: "This experiment will estimate the impact of access to an array of subsidized transportation options on individual mobility, employment, and other socioeconomic outcomes. The study sample will consist of 100 low-income working-age residents of the Manchester/Chateau neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Study participants will be randomly assigned to either a treatment or control group. The treatment group will receive the following transportation subsidies for 12 months: 

- An unlimited public transportation pass
- Five 30-minute rides per day on the Spin electric scooter platform
- Unlimited 30-minute rides on POGOH, Pittsburgh's bikeshare platform
- A Zipcar membership with $60 monthly credit

The control group will not receive any transportation subsidies beyond what they usually receive outside of the study. Primary study outcomes include earnings and labor supply, measures of spatial mobility, and receipt of public benefits.
