abstract: "We conduct an experiment to study individual repeated risk-taking behavior, both under pre-commitment and sequentially. In particular, we elicit each subjectâ€™s unconstrained risk-taking strategy, that is, the completely contingent plan of taking a risk several times. In five between-subject treatments, we vary the existence of defaults and the availability of a reminder. Another treatment allows only for specific (rather than completely contingent) risk-taking plans, and one treatment is without plan elicitation (focusing on sequential risk-taking)"
