abstract: "This study quantifies the value consumers require to share their electricity consumption data with firms and researchers for business and research purposes. Using a randomized controlled trial, we examine how this value responds to information about the potential benefits and costs of data sharing, as well as to consumer characteristics, including average electricity consumption.
