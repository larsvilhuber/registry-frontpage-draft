abstract: "I investigate in an experimental survey, whether publicly informing individuals from disadvantaged groups that their selection for a beneficial opportunity, such as an educational program, is based on their group identity, affects their evaluation of the quality of the program. In a lab-in-the-field experiment in collaboration with a Colombian university, I present information of the international program to students from different social groups and ask them to indicate the value the course would have for them. Some are shown a course invitation that discloses that they would be invited to the program because of their demographics, others are not. I also, elicit beliefs about the evaluation of the course by students from multiple social groups."
