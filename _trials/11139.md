abstract: "We conduct a survey-based experiment to examine health insurance demand and overconfidence in health among married individuals. The aim is to provide direct evidence that individuals are overconfident about their own and their spouse's health risks and that they believe they are healthier than their spouses. Additionally, we will investigate how individuals update health-related information about themselves compared to their spouses. The questionnaire comprises six parts. The first part is for collecting basic information about the subjects and their spouses, including age and gender. The second part focuses on the subjects' perceptions of their own and their spouses' health risk. The third part explores how they update health-related information about themselves and their spouses. The fourth part collects health information for both the subjects and their spouses. The fifth part collects information on the subjects' and their spouses' occupation, education level, lifestyle habits, risk preferences, and commercial insurance purchases. Finally, the sixth part focuses on the potential effect of the experimenter's demand. We expect that the results of the experiment will provide valuable insights into health insurance demand and overconfidence among married individuals, shedding light on how they update and perceive health-related information about themselves and their spouses."
