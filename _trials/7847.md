abstract: "Online labor market (e.g., Freelancer.com, Upworker.com, Fivre.com) provides opportunities for service-seeking buyers (i.e., employers) to find service-providers (i.e., workers) to work on jobs and for workers to find jobs. In this experiment, we examine how communication qualities (the proportion of certainty- and rapport building-words) in competing workers’ pitches (i.e., texts) influenced employer’ hiring decisions in online labor marketplaces. We already have findings about these questions using real-world data from one of largest online labor market places. We found online service-pitchers’ proportion of certainty-words to be positively associated with their getting selected by service-seeking buyers up to a threshold after which words of certainty harmed sellers’ contract-acquisitions; and this inverted U-shaped relationship, which matches the “too much of a good thing (TMGT) effect,” was stronger when sellers’ pitches had fewer (rather than more) rapport-building words. This experiment is used to verify our findings. We additionally examine effects of geographical (dis)similarity on above relationships."
