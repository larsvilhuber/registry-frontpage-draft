abstract: "The importance of an informed electorate for electoral accountability is widely recognized. However, while a large literature has focused on voter access to news media, little is known empirically about when media outlets choose to provide voters with indicators of their incumbent party's performance in office. This project seeks to explain the relatively low supply of incumbent performance information in Mexico using a three-year and six-period clustered design exploiting differential treatment intensity within media market clusters. We will scrape newspapers and radio stations to generate a massive corpus of text and audio news reports, before applying recent advances in text analysis and machine transcription to measure what the media does and does not report. We will first identify the extent to which search costs affect whether radio stations and newspapers report the results of independent audit reports detailing mayoral malfeasance in office. We will then identify how the effects of providing media outlets with information varies with media market competition and proximity to elections. Finally, we will identify the extent to which outlets learn to acquire information for themselves after receiving a prior treatment or local spillover. We intend for our findings to shed light on an essential but understudied condition required for voters to be able to hold governments accountable for their performance in office. This pre-analysis plan registers our experimental design and how our hypotheses will be tested."
