abstract: "Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have very low completion rates. Often not more than 15% of those signing up finish the course with a certificate. In this paper we argue that present bias helps explain this phenomenon. In a randomized field experiment we test whether prompting enrollees to schedule their next study sessions increases MOOC engagement and completion. Additionally, we elicit time-inconsistency and examine how awareness of it influences treatment effects."
