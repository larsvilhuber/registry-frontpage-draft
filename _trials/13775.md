abstract: "This study investigates the impact of scientific consensus information on public perceptions of climate change and their willingness to pay for mitigation efforts. Utilizing a representative sample of the Italian adult population, participants are randomized into four groups, each exposed to varying statements about the anthropogenic causes of climate change from two scientists with opposing views. Subsequently, participants receive information on the degree of scientific consensus regarding these views. The experiment measures changes in participants' willingness to pay both in income and as an extra cost for consumer goods to mitigate climate change effects. Control variables include political affiliation, education level, and trust in science. Findings provide insights into the effectiveness of consensus messaging in influencing public attitudes towards climate change and policy support.
