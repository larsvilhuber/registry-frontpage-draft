abstract: "This project studies the motivations behind controversial political expression from the perspective of social image concern. On August 23, 2023, Japan initiated the discharge of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima Nuclear Plant into the Pacific Ocean, a move that provoked significant backlash across Asian countries, particularly in China, where anti-Japan sentiment is deeply ingrained due to historical and geopolitical reasons. The study takes the unique context of the anti-Japan expression in China following Japanâ€™s discharge to investigate the public expression towards this event. I hypothesize that public expressions are driven by two primary motivations: the anti-Japan ideology, which is controversial due to its association with extreme nationalism, and concerns about the environmental consequence, which constitute a non-controversial motivation. In a theoretical model, I show that increasing the perceived prevalence of non-controversial motivations among the public can encourage individuals to engage in controversial expressions by providing a "social cover". Conversely, increasing the perception of proportion of the public with a controversial motivation has theoretically ambiguous effect on individual decision. I then design two online experiments to test the model prediction. "
