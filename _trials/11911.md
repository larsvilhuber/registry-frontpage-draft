abstract: "We study mobility and dynamics of competition in the lab using multi-tiered competitive tournament environments that have different performance requirements using a real-effort task -- the addition of five two-digit numbers. Our design allows us to study the extent to which we observe efficient sorting across genders and under different informational provisions over repeated interactions with the same group members. We investigate whether feedback eliminates or reduces the gender gap in willingness to compete in a dynamic setting, and if there are gender differences in persistence and staying in a comfort zone. Lastly, we investigate whether there are differences in the dynamics of upward and downward mobility by gender. "
