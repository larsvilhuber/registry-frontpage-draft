abstract: "In this study, I will conduct a randomized experiment in which I present voters with campaign posters that closely resemble real-world posters in order to ascertain the effects of different kinds of direct appeals (consisting of a candidateâ€™s personal ethnic and class background as well as the policy platform advocated by him or her), endorsements by societal organizations, party cues, and gender on vote preferences and participation in campaign events."
