abstract: "In this experiment, we evaluate an evidence-backed, low-cost intervention to improve academic performance and reduce risk-behaviour through the development of socioemo- tional skills amongst vulnerable children – those who are most at-risk of being victims and/or perpetrators of violence. We will conduct a Cluster-randomised Trial (CRT) at school level in two municipalities in Brazil to evaluate the SEJA intervention that is based on successful experiences conducted in Chicago, Liberia and Canada. SEJA has low direct costs and is scalable when compared to similar interventions. The program has been designed to leverage municipalities’ existing personnel and infrastructure, making it ideal for implementation in low and medium income countries. We will estimate the interventions’ causal impacts on short and long-term outcomes. On the short-term, we look at outcomes such as socioemotional skills, academic performance, school frequency and enrolment in high school. The longitudinal design of our study allows us to conduct follow-up rounds of survey and administrative data collection to estimate causal impacts on long-term outcomes, such as criminal sanctions, victimisation, other self-reported vul- nerabilities, participation in anti-poverty programs and labour market outcomes."
