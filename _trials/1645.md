abstract: "The National Council for Education Development (CONAFE) introduced a community-based model (referred to as community schools) to deliver educational services to rural highly marginalized areas. Young graduates – mostly from high school –teach in the primary and lower secondary levels. In exchange, these teachers receive a small stipend during their posting as well as a scholarship to continue their studies after their posting. In 2009, as part of the attempts to improve the quality of service delivery, CONAFE launched the Asesores Pedagogicos Itinerantes (APIs) (simply referred as mobile tutors) program. The intervention, which targets under-performing primary schools in remote areas, aims primarily at empowering parents, and providing pedagogical support to teachers and low-performing students. The APIs, who are selected among recent university graduates, are paid stipends in line with the entrance salaries of public school teachers. Each mobile tutor is assigned to two schools, where he/she spends two weeks on a continuous basis each month. During the time spent in the community, the tutor engages in three different activities: 1) delivery of pedagogical support to teachers; 2) one-on-one remedial sessions to the worst-performing students; and 3) home visits to the parents to provide information on their children’s learning progress, and promote their involvement in their education and participation in school related activities. 

The objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of the APIs program on  a) students’ reading, math and vocabulary and verbal skills as measured by the Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA), Early Grade Math Assessment (EGMA), b) the transition from primary to lower secondary education. The study will analyze the potential contributing factors by analyzing the impact of the APIs program on  c) the pedagogical practices used by the teachers in the classroom as measured by a Stallings type instrument; and d) the involvement of parents in the children’s education through the HOME instrument.

The evaluation is experimental, with an initial random assignment of schools to the following intervention and comparison groups:
1.	T1 group: 70 schools were assigned to the standard API treatment, as described above
2.	T2 group: 60 schools were assigned to the strengthened API treatment. The treatment T2 differs from the T1 treatment in the intensity and the contents of the training provided to the APIs. Instead of an one-week initial training, the APIs in the T2 group receive two weeks of training, and they will attend bimonthly three day sessions, that will allow the APIs, among other things, to receive feedback from the community.
3.	C group: 100 schools (of the type A) act as a control group and receive no treatment
