abstract: "Tenondera (Guarani for "onward") is a program run by the Paraguayan Ministry of Social Development that combines a seed capital transfer and a business and life skills coaching program to propel income-generating activities of low-income households across Paraguay. We use a randomized phase-in design to evaluate the impacts of Tenondera on key variables such as income, assets, and savings. In addition, we study the sources of impact heterogeneity among Tenondera beneficiaries, the impact pathway for the duration of the program and after its end, the role of psychological spillovers in the transmission of program effects, and the incidence of the program on existing and new social network links in the treated communities."
