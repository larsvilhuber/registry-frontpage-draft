abstract: "Communication has become an important policy tool for central banks in recent years. For instance, forward guidance policies seek to anchor economic agentsâ€™ expectations of macroeconomic variables. This is a particularly important tool when constrained by interest rates that are close to the lower bound. In order for such policies to be effective, economic agents must engage with central bank (CB) communications. This requires agents to be able to understand such communications. However, often CB communications are linguistically complex, increasing the costs to economic agents of engaging. This acts as a barrier to engagement, and particularly so with the general public. A growing literature has focused on establishing the association between linguistic complexity and the degree to which the general public engages with CB communications and forms well anchored expectations about the economy. The focus from central banks has largely been on simplifying the linguistic structure of the communication, but another important dimension is the complexity of the concepts being communicated. Our information experiment seeks to understand relative importance of each of these dimensions in order to better design communication policies for central banks. 

The information provision experiment is designed to expose participants to different degrees of semantic and conceptual complexity in order to ascertain the relative importance of each to the ability of members of the general public to understand the important central bank communication. "
