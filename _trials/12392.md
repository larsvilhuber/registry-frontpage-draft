abstract: "We study the effectiveness of the central bank message delivery on households' inflation and interest rate expectations.  We provide random subsets of participants in the Nielsen Homescan panel with video, audio, transcript, one chart from the monetary policy report press conference. We ask their inflation and interest rate expectations before and after the treatment. We also follow up their shopping behavior in the incoming months. This experiment allows us to assess to what extent these verbal and nonverbal communications in the different formats of communication alter the beliefs and spending plans of households."
