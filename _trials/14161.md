abstract: "There is a growing interest in understanding how subjective beliefs shape behaviors. Survey experiments, which randomly vary exposure to information treatments, aim to provide causal evidence of this link, but the methodology used by existing studies might suffer from limitations to its external validity.  This study employs a survey experiment to address this gap by comparing the effects of 'forced' versus 'self-selected' information exposure on beliefs and behavioral intentions. This study is concerned with understanding whether giving participants the option to choose information consumption (rather than being forced to consuming it) can enhance external validity and reduce social desirability bias. The study aims to (i) provide evidence on the willingness to consume belief-altering information when not coerced, (ii) offer methodological insights to enhance the validity of survey experiments, and (iii) explore how information consumption influences trust in institutions and overall societal welfare."
