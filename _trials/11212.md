abstract: "The region of Cabo Delgado, Mozambique, is currently facing a jihadist insurgency, launched by Al-Shabaab, which has already led to 150,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) to relocate to Pemba, the provincial capital. I will conduct a field experiment in Pemba in which IDPs and local Pemba residents will be joined in four community meetings. Each community meetings will focus on a specific topic: life in Pemba's neighbourhoods; prejudice; religious tolerance; future and aspirations. Four hypotheses will be tested: (1) direct contact between groups will improve tolerance, trust, and social cohesion, and will generate social networks between locals and IDPs; (2) exposure to IDPs will decrease the support of both locals and IDPs for insurgents; (3) the marginal returns of intergroup contact are decreasing in the level of contact; (4) intergroup contact generates spillovers based on i) geographic proximity and ii) network proximity to treated individuals. This trial will improve on a pilot intervention also conducted by me (AEARCTR-0009827).
