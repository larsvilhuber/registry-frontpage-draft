abstract: "The impact of requiring the GREs on student admissions decisions has long been a point of discussion in the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health. Most graduate programs in the school have decided not to require the GREs any longer. However, GREs are still required for applicants to the MPH in Epidemiology and Biostatistics program as well as for the PhD Program in all degree concentrations. These programs that are still requiring the GREs have decided to assess what impact the GREs have on admissions decisions. For this study, we are conducting a randomized controlled trial, with randomization scheme and review methods varying by program (MPH versus doctoral). For the MPH program, faculty members who volunteer to review program applications will be randomly assigned to one of two groups, one group will have applicant GRE scores visible for review (Group A)) and one group will not be able to see the GRE scores (Group B). Applications will be assigned to reviewers in batches, with each applicant being randomly assigned to one reviewer in each group, so each application will
be reviewed by two faculty members, one in group A (with GREs) and one in group B (without GREs). Faculty members will be re-randomized to group A or B with each new batch of applications ready for review. For Doctoral Program applications, all applications will be randomly assigned to two reviewers, one with GREs visible and one without. The order of review will also be randomized to avoid bias if, for example, a reviewer decided to first review all applications with the GREs and then all those without.  We will then use risk ratio regression, stratified on program (MPH or Doctoral) with GEE to adjust for clustering (same applicant reviewed by two people) to determine what impact viewing the GREs has on admission decisions (admit or reject in the case of the MPH Program and decision to interview or not in the case of the PhD Program). In order to ensure fairness in the application process, for MPH program applications, in cases in which the two reviewers disagree on the admissions decision, the application will be reviewed by a third reviewer with the GREs visible (the current admissions standard) and the final admissions decision will be based on the two reviewers who viewed the GRE scores. If they disagree based on their application
reviews, they will discuss their decisions and come to a consensus decision, as is standard. For doctoral program applications, when the two reviewers disagree the entire Department Doctoral Program Admissions Committee will review the application with the GRE score visible and come to a consensus, which is the traditional procedure outside of the GRE evaluation. These additional reviews for application with discrepant admissions decisions will be conducted outside of the experiment (i.e. their decisions will not be part of the analysis). For both study populations (MPH in Epidemiology and Biostatistics and PhD Program), we will also explore applicant characteristics such as
race/ethnicity, gender and age as possible modifiers of the impact viewing the GREs has on admissions decisions."
