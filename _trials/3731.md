abstract: "One in four births in the Brazilian state of Bahia are from women between the ages of 15 and 19. These teenage pregnancies result in high school dropout rates. This evaluation will experimentally measure the impact of a peer-led high school program designed to prevent teenage pregnancies and help students complete high school. The intervention entails increasing aspirations, encouraging educational attainment, building self-esteem and providing information about reproductive health, so as to help pupils set their life goals. From a sample of 135 high schools in the state capital, 90 are randomly selected to receive the program. Training is provided to teams of peer educators who then disseminate the information in their schools. We experimentally measure the effectiveness of three peer educator selection strategies: (1) most connected in terms of network centrality; (2) most popular or “cool” as identified by a student survey and (3) nomination by school staff.
