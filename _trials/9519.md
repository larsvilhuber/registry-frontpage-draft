abstract: "The project studies how information frictions in centralized college application systems restrain low-SES students from making well-informed major choices and hinder their upward mobility. Using administrative data from China, I find that students from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds are more likely to apply to and enroll in majors that they have been exposed to during high school education despite the lower labor market returns. I conduct an online survey experiment to examine whether the disparity in major choices is driven by differential access to information between high- and low-SES students and whether information treatment can help close the gap."
