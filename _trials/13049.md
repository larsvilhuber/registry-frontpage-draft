abstract: "School attendance remains an open policy issue in large parts of sub-Saharan Africa, where free primary education has not translated into full attendance. The cost of attending and learning is higher for children born to subsistence farming households, who are more frequently sick or malnourished, and whose school time overlaps with farm work. We leverage the randomized expansion of the national school feeding program in Malawi to study the impacts of a negative shock on the cost of attending school; we aim to understand if the program is effective in bringing children to the classroom and fostering better health and education, especially during the lean season when child labor has a higher opportunity-cost.
