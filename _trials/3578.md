abstract: "Correct attribution of responsibility for economic outcomes is one of the key assumptions underlying citizens’ ability to hold politicians accountable: It allows citizens to use punishment and reward strategies to discipline politicians and to prevent them from introducing policies that contravene the preferences of the electoral majority. This project seeks to empirically assess whether (potentially biased) source of information can affect public perception’s of re- sponsibility in non-democratic setting. That is to answer whether government which controls large part of media in autocracies, can effectively shift public attribution of responsibility and therefore allocation of blame and credit for public policy outcomes. To tackle this question I propose a panel factorial survey experiment, which exposes random subsets of residents of the largest municipality in Russia (the city of Novosibirsk) to the pre-recorded local TV news reports covering outcomes of and/or allocation of responsibility for local health care (HC) policy. The experiment allows me to assess (1) whether the framing of responsibilities affects citizens’ attri- bution of blame and credit for particular policy outcomes to different tiers of government, and (2) whether the perceptions of the bias of the local media, knowledge of the issues covered and prior beliefs about local policy outcomes mediate the effects of such framing."
