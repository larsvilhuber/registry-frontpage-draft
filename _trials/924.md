abstract: "Public health organizations dedicated to suicide prevention frequently use websites to educate the public about suicide, but studies investigating the impact of these websites on individuals with varying degree of suicidality are scarce. We investigated the impact of three educative suicide prevention websites compared to a website not related to suicide and tested the moderating effect of the participants’ baseline suicidality on the effects. We conducted a randomized controlled trial with 160 adults who were assigned to four groups. Data on the audience’s risk factors for suicide and knowledge about suicide were collected before the experiment (T1, baseline), immediately after website exposure (T2) and one week later (T3). We stratified the sample into two groups by the median of suicidality at baseline. We investigated the impact of websites further with qualitative interviews of 12 participants."
