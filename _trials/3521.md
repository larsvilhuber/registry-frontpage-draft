abstract: "The opportunity to free-ride on other individuals' learning costs can delay technology adoption or lead to sub-optimal adoption rates. 
I study learning about a pest-control technology among small-holding farmers in Uganda. In this context, delayed adoption may enable a large scale infestation with sizeable economic effects.
I identify two types of free-riding in my setting, namely free-riding on information and free-riding on action.I attempt at separating the two by exploiting experimental variation induced by information interventions."
