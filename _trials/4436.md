abstract: "From September 2018, financial education was integrated into 4 subjects Mathematics, Me and the World, Algebra and Social Science in 350 schools of Armenia. For the next 3 consecutive years this program will be implemented in the rest of 1050 schools in tranches. Little is known about the effectiveness of financial education in schools, and to fill this gap we ran a randomized control trial to assess the effectiveness of integration of financial education in school curriculum. Specifically our research analyses the impact of this program on financial knowledge, skills and attitude.

The evaluation was conducted over the course of four school year, from September 2020 to September 2022, by Central Bank of Armenia. Our experimental sample consists of the students from 2nd grade to 11th grade in 100 schools. In our analysis we used a phase-in design and randomly assigned the time which the schools are going to get the treatment."
