abstract: "We study the drivers of non take-up (NTU) in social programs, focusing on the Spanish Minimum Income Scheme (Ingreso MÃ­nimo Vital, IMV), a program that guarantees every household a minimum income. Around 57% of households that could access the IMV have not applied for it. Previous literature suggests that this could be due to a lack of awareness of the regulation, not recognizing oneself as a possible recipient, the lack of proximity to the corresponding administration, stigmatization, socio-economic or socio-cultural barriers such as linguistic or digital divide, or participation in the informal economy and a related mistrust of contacting public authorities in this situation. In this paper, we seek to understand the main factors that determine the phenomenon of NTU. The randomized control trial will allocate 400 neighborhoods in Spain to one of the following possible treatments: an in-person intervention, a social media intervention, or both. A fourth group will serve as pure control. Interventions provide information on the existence of the program and requirements to apply and provide support with the application process. We expect the interventions to decrease NTU, reduce poverty, and increase trust in public administrations."
