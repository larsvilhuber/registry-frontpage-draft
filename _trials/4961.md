abstract: "Reporting private information is a key part of economic decision making. A recent literature has found that many people have a preference for honest reporting, contrary to usual economic assumptions. In this study, we investigate what determines these preferences. We experimentally measure preferences for honesty in a sample of children. We explore relations between a child’s reporting behaviour and parents’ characteristics. We further explore the causal effect of the social environment by randomly enrolling children in a year-long mentoring program."
