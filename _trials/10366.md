abstract: "We measure public awareness and support levels toward affirmative action for women in elected office across the Brazilian population. We evaluate the effect of providing citizens with information about recent reforms in the campaign finance system tying the public funding of elections to gender allocation rules (henceforth, “campaign finance quotas”). We compare support for campaign finance quotas against underlying preferences for female representation and disentangle it from attitudes towards public funding. We correlate both with political preferences and voting behavior in the past 2022 general elections. We conduct a survey experiment of 2,000 individuals with physical interviews across 120 towns in Brazil and give them information about the new Electoral Fund, on its size and allocation rules across parties based on the gender of their candidates. We aim first to assess the level of public awareness on these reforms, and then to evaluate their informational effect on citizens’ preferences for this affirmative action policy. The treatment will consist of exposing a randomized set of the respondents each to information about one of three reforms (three different treatments), while the rest are not exposed and used as a control group. We contribute to the literature on gender quotas by documenting empirically whether there is a principle-policy paradox and a backlash effect that would diminish their effectiveness in Brazil."
