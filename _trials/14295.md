abstract: "This project uses a survey experiment to shed light on the effects of future income shocks on households’ decisions within the unique context of the Canadian mortgage market. It aims to inform the effects on aggregate demand and financial stability of increases in nominal interest rates. The current Canadian context provides a unique natural experiment: over the past four years, nominal interest rates have surged from historic lows – leading to significant mortgage debt accumulation – to rapid increases due to inflation surge. Unlike the US and most of Europe, Canadian mortgage rates are typically fixed for no more than five years, resulting in substantial negative payment shocks upon renewal. Exploiting the variation in the timing and size of the shocks further allows a quasi-random matching process, a common challenge in natural experiments. 
This project will investigate the extent to which consumers correctly anticipate their mortgage shock, and which actions in terms of consumption, labor supply, saving, investment and debt they are planning in face of it, which we will then interpret in light of the theoretical model of consumption behavior.
