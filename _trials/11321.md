abstract: "This online experiment investigates the relationship between Kantian morality and cooperation behavior in the context of three different cooperative games: sequential prisonerâ€™s dilemma, trust game, and ultimatum game. We aim to answer the question of how pairing participants with similar backgrounds affects cooperation behavior, pro-social behavior, beliefs, and moral values. Participants are randomly assigned to a control or treatment group. In the control group, participants were paired randomly, while in the treatment group, participants were paired with individuals who shared similar background characteristics, such as grade, attending college, homely city, and work routine. This study provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms that drive cooperative behavior and informs our understanding of human social behavior."
