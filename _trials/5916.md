abstract: "Low-engagement is a central challenging for Massive Open Online Course users. In particular, most students are silent and do not ask questions. Deploying Xiaomu, the AI teaching assistant on XuetangX, which is the largest MOOC platform in China, we examine which social information is more effective for encouraging students to ask questions and consequently improve their learning performance."
