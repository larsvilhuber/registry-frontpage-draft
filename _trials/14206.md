abstract: "The diffusion of new technologies is a crucial driver for growth in low-income countries, especially in the agricultural sector. Motivated by theory, researchers and policymakers have relied on networks as a source of rapid knowledge diffusion, yet often with modest empirical results, suggesting that information transmission is not frictionless. We propose a novel mechanism that might prevent information diffusion: “knowledge hoarding.” In settings where early technology adopters (incumbents) derive rents from it, they might strategically halt its diffusion to preserve the rent their knowledge grants them. This project asks whether knowledge hoarding limit aggregate productivity gains because of distributional consequences generated by knowledge diffusion. 

We study this question in the context of modern agricultural technologies in Burundi, where agents already trained in the new technology (incumbents) have a private incentive not to share knowledge in the labor market: they face higher labor demand and a wage premium from mastering the planting technologies. We design two experiments to quantify the effect of knowledge hoarding on knowledge diffusion, and to show the distributional and aggregate consequences of knowledge hoarding on labor market equilibria, technology adoption, and productivity.
