abstract: "The proposed project aims to investigate the effect of social identity on the dynamics of social learning in networks. Social learning, i.e. learning by observing or communicating with others, plays a key role in individuals, firms, and governments’ decision-making processes. A lot of casual evidence suggests that both the learners and the sources social identity play a crucial role in how information from others is processed. Despite this fact there is little research on this question. In this project we study whether and how the social identity of an information source affects the perception of credibility of information, the willingness to update based on this information and ultimately how those factors affect learning dynamics in networks."
