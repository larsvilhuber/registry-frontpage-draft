abstract: "While the internet has eased the ability to exchange information, the veracity of information obtained online can be difficult to determine. As many transactions move online, organizations now face challenges in ensuring the integrity of data that they acquire. For example, online review platforms want truthful reviews that provide informative signal to consumers, insurance companies benefit from truthful claims that do not falsely raise their costs, and social networks can improve their network quality from accurate information. In this study, we explore how being online influences individualsâ€™ propensity to be honest, as well as the conditions under which individuals are more likely to tell the truth online. "
