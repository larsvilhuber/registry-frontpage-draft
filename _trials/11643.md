abstract: "We plan to study pricing behavior in the market for cellphone repair, which is a credence environment. Our main variable of interest is the price of repairing a cellphone.  We conduct a field experiment in which actual market transactions are conducted in repairing a deliberately damaged cellphone. As a baseline, in all repair stores, we have the customer directly request that the damaged part is replaced.  With a different customer in the same store, with the same cellphone model and problem, we have them state they do not know what is wrong with the phone.  There are 6 treatments, and the random allocation of these treatments is done at the store level, using the random shuffling of a computer. The treatments are 3x2, with one dimension varying the gender of the customer.  The other dimension varies what additional lines the customer is instructed to state (if any). The first is no additional lines, the second is insisting on getting replaced parts back and requiring contact before any repairs are conducted, and the third is stating that they trust the repairer to conduct the necessary repairs without being contacted first.  We also elicit beliefs from the ‘mystery shoppers’ we use as customers, and have them play as a FM in an investment game, where the store in question will be the SM.  The SM decision will be in a follow-up survey of stores, where other things like their personality traits and perceptions of their customers are asked."
