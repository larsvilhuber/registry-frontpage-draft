abstract: "Previous research found evidence that high quality math apps have the potential to increase children's math skills. This project evaluates whether sharing this research-based information with PreK-4th grade teachers increases the likelihood of their recommending math apps to their students for home use. Additionally, we analyze if the fact that other teachers are recommending math apps influences the teacher's decision to do so as well. We designed a factorial survey experiment. Teachers are asked how likely they are, in a scale from 0 to 10, to recommend 4 hypothetical apps, where each app is accompanied by one the following sets of information: (1) just a description of the app, (2) description and evidence-based information, (3) description and the percentage of teachers recommending it, and (4) description, evidence-based information, and percentage of teachers recommending it. In order to be able to interpret the results causally, we randomize which app gets which set of information and the order in which the apps appear.
