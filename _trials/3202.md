abstract: "21st Century Scholars is a state-run program that provides up to four years of college tuition at participating public Indiana colleges and universities for qualified, low-income students. Students enroll in the program at the end of their eighth grade year and are eligible for funds if they meet certain milestones through their high school years. To date, a low fraction of eligible students receive funds through the program and the low enrollment rate is particularly a problem for students from local area school districts. The Wilson Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunities (LEO) worked with two Michiana area school districts to conduct an impact evaluation of light-touch “nudge” interventions for parents of eligible eighth-graders to encourage them to enroll in the 21st Century Scholars program. This evaluation addresses the issue of low enrollment for a high reward program through a random assignment experiment. Students were randomized into either Treatment 1 receiving a letter in the mail, Treatment 2 receiving a phone call, or Control. We tracked students who are eligible for free and reduced-price lunch over time to determine whether light touch nudges increase enrollment in the 21st Century Scholars program. We observed enrollment rates across groups, and will look at other key outcomes for participants, including grades, program enrollment rates, and completion of the program."
