abstract: "We are conducting a study to examine how voters balance environmental and economic factors, particularly deforestation and employment, when deciding who to support in local municipal elections in Brazil. This study uses a survey with an embedded information treatment to assess how providing relevant data about deforestation and employment in local areas may influence voters' decisions. The first survey will be conducted before the election to capture voters' intentions. After the election, a follow-up survey will assess whether voters changed their preferences based on the information they received. The goal is to better understand how environmental and economic tradeoffs are valued in local political decisions."
