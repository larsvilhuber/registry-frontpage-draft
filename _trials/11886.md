abstract: "Cases of financial professionals misappropriating client assets for personal gain are rampant. In personal finance, financial institutions have introduced AI-assisted robo-advisors to optimize investments for investors using AI technology. We are trying to understand if investors will convert their distrust in financial professionals into trust in objective algorithm-based investments. We plan to collaborate with a Chinese mobile financial app company, disseminating information to users regarding occupational misappropriation by financial professionals and observing whether users increase their preference for robo-advisor products in their choice of financial products.

We plan to replace the splash screen of the experimental group's mobile app with slogans related to losses caused by human errors of financial experts. On the other hand, the control group sample will use a splash screen with sayings unrelated to human errors of financial experts. By comparing the experimental and control groups, we can determine whether AI's objectivity or financial experts' subjectivity plays a positive role in user adoption of robo-advisor portfolios."
