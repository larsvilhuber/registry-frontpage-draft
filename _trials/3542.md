abstract: "We investigate the impact of fare-free public transport on travel behavior. We randomly assigned a public transportation pass to individuals working in Santiago (Chile) that allowed them unlimited travel without paying and evaluated its effects over two weeks. The results show that access to fare-free public transport increased the total number of trips, regardless of the mode, by 11%. Interestingly, this trip generation effect is mostly driven by an increase in the number of trips made by modes other than public transport. The average treatment effect public transport trips is positive yet not significant. Therefore we find evidence of a trip generation effect, that there is no transport-mode substitution and, as a consequence, no evidence that fare-free public transport reduces negative externalities from car travel."
