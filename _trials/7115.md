abstract: "In this project we seek to examine an integrated approach that aims to improve nutrition security of children, adolescent girls and women of childbearing age by improving smallholdersâ€™ production and consumption of nutrient-rich food, more specifically orange fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) in Uganda. We aim to address the resource and information constraints by providing access to subsidized inputs and training on the health benefits of consuming nutrient-rich crops. In a cluster randomized trial, these two sets of interventions are implemented both separately and as combined package to test possible complementarity between them. In addition, to test the existence of credit, behavioral and price risk barriers that smallholders may face in adopting nutrient-rich crops - the project offered customized credit, voucher for inputs and price guarantee products. The key outcomes for the project are - production and consumption of OFSP, household food diversity, and health status of the children.  "
