abstract: "Through a lab-in-the-field experiment, we will study the effect of two individual-level video-based interventions to improve the salience of water quality and demand for quality testing of drinking water. Outcomes will be measured through a behavioural game and a post-game survey at a lab on day one, and through takeup of household water quality testing offered at the household on day two."
