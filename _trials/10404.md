abstract: "The study aims to investigate consumers’ choices for imported organic and local food to help separate motivations based on perceived health and food-safety (private) benefits versus environmental (public) benefits. Specifically, we will conduct a field experiment in supermarkets and farmers’ markets in Taiwan to investigate how information on the private and public benefits of organic and local food respectively affect consumers’ willingness to pay for potatoes."
