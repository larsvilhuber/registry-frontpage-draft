abstract: "Executive functions such as working memory, self-regulation, inhibitory control, are mental processes that enable the voluntary control of actions, thoughts and emotions. Executive functions play a key role in academic learning, as early as preschool. There exist stark inequalities in the distribution of executive functions at school entry, especially between children from different socio-economic background. This experiment aims at  training  executive functions in pre-schoolers by providing them with several sessions of pretend-play activities in small groups. Pretend-play activities are extracted from the Tools of the Mind curriculum. The experiment aims at measuring the short run impact of pretend-play activities on brain functioning, executive functions, child' s self-regulation, socio-affective skills and academic outcomes. The experiment uses a pairwise randomized controlled trial on a target on 70 children with a pre-post design if possible and a post design when not enough pre and post outcomes are available. "
