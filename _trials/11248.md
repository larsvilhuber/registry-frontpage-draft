abstract: "There is growing attention to the complex pattern of uncertainty attitudes in the traffic context. Existing studies often assume that travellers treat travel time uncertainty as risk, i.e., outcomes with a known probability distribution. However, travellers often face ambiguous travel times, i.e., with an unknown probability distribution. In this study, we develop a novel framework of uncertainty attitudes in the transport context to investigate decision-making under uncertainty for commuting travel, which are day-to-day types of repeated situations. Specifically, we focus on the role of ambiguity attitudes in mode choice. Furthermore, we aim to establish the potential link between source preferences and mode preferences. Our online experiment design consists of a baseline group and two treated groups: one with additional information from historical travel time and another considering a commute trip from participants' real life."
