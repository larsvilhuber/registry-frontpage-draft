abstract: "This research project aims to investigate the existence of gender differences in the adoption and use of AI technologies, specifically ChatGPT. Previous studies have highlighted a "Digital Divide," showing disparities in internet usage between men and women. This project seeks to extend our understanding of this divide to the realm of AI technologies. We aim to (i) identify whether a gender gap exists in the adoption of ChatGPT, (ii) explore the underlying mechanisms driving any observed disparities, (iii) assess the impact of this gap on productivity, and (iv) evaluate the efficacy of interventions aimed at reducing the gender gap in AI adoption."
