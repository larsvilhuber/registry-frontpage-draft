abstract: "The Big Push for the Rural Economy (BPRE) program provides vocational skills training in the agriculture and livestock sectors in four high-poverty districts of South Punjab. By infusing frontier skills and practices simultaneously at multiple nodes of the value chains, BPRE presents an opportunity to rigorously evaluate the impact of “big push” intervention on village-level GDP, productivity, household income and the extent of spillovers.
