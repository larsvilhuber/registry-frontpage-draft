abstract: "Students form beliefs about their expected performance in a course based on incomplete information. This may cause students to make sub-optimal effort decisions and ultimately negatively impact their performance. In this study, we examine the impact of providing students with complete information about their likelihood of success in a course. Using a field experiment, we study how such an intervention affects students' effort, attendance and academic performance.  "
