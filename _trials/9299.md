abstract: "The period of pandemic has observed an exponential rise in free access webinars. However, a large fraction of students who opt to enroll for these webinars/courses do not attend it. If they decide to attend, they have a low engagement and learning, and often dropout before it ends. Our paper studies whether symbolic incentives offered to attend these webinars affect the attributes of the participants who enroll for such online events, and whether it subsequently affects their attendance, engagement, learning and dropout rate."
