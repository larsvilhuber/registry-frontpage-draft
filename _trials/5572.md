abstract: "We partner with the Entrepreneurship Development Center (EDC) to implement a business plan competition. As part of their advertising of the competition, EDC used their previous customer based call list to notify previous clients about the business plan competition. They randomly assigned whether the call would include an offer for in-person assistance on completing the application and participating in the Business Plan Competition. We test whether the offer increased participation, particularly for groups that are generally observed as having less access to capital, and whether the quality of the encouraged business differed as a function of the offer.
