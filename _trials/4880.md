abstract: "We conduct a field experiment with small and medium-sized firms in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We study whether incentivizing these firms to formalize their hiring process by subsidizing formal vacancy postings changes their hiring behavior and outcomes. In a second treatment arm, we also offer firms to screen all applicants to their vacancies."
