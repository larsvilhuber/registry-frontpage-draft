abstract: "Employers’ decision-making processes are constantly shaped, enabled, and restricted by their organizational, institutional, and societal contexts. While most studies focus on the immediate organizational context, few consider macro-level dynamics such as social traditions, customs, and political climate. This study addresses this gap by examining the role of political context in employers’ hiring decisions. It asks the question: To what extent does the influence of political context on hiring discrimination against immigrants vary across counties with different political orientations? An audit study is conducted in counties with varying political leanings in four states to answer this question. The results illustrate how employers leverage contextual factors beyond applicants’ personal characteristics in hiring decisions and highlight the labor market consequences amid political polarization."
