abstract: "This online survey constitutes a first step in a larger research project with the aim of understanding paternalism, i.e., how do individuals handle the trade-off between autonomy/freedom of choice and individual well-being/social welfare. With this first survey, we seek to understand what motivates the decision to restrict choice sets and how different forms of interventions compare to each other. Specifically, we investigate whether paternalists differentiate between reasons within the paternalee vs. external factors and how much the intensity of the restriction (i.e., removing options vs. setting defaults) matters. Furthermore, we try to shed light on how much paternalists value the effectiveness of their intervention."
