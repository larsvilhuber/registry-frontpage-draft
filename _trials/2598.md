abstract: "The Behavioural Economics Team of the Australian Government (BETA) will prepare advice concerning the design of energy price fact sheets. Fact sheets aim to help consumers compare energy plans. Behaviourally informed designs may also improve consumer comprehension, clarity, and ease of decision making with regard to household energy choices. This is a mixed methods study, constituted of a framed field experiment and qualitative focus groups."
