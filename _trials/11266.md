abstract: "Competitions in the workplace are often “dirty”. Competitors may sabotage their opponents, lie about their contributions, or retaliate against winners. Yet, we know little about willingness to enter such competitions and how it varies across individuals. We conduct an online experiment to address several new questions regarding willingness to compete when the competition is not clean. "
