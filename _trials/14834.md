abstract: "In this project, we study the effects of interactions between racial and political groups in work place settings. We organize job trainings on an online platform in Brazil that expose participants to a co-worker of either the same race and political identity or to a co-worker of a different race or political identity. We measure the effect of the interaction on productivity and preferences for discrimination."
