abstract: "Sustainability is a crucial concept in the environmental domain, but also in other areas such as financial matters or regarding personal health. Sustainability means using resources in a way that does not compromise the availability of those resources tomorrow. We propose a dynamic threshold public goods game that captures essential features of sustainability. First, the game is dynamic in the sense that the actions played in each period have consequences for future periods. Second, over-using given resources (i.e. above a certain threshold) leads to a decline of these resources. Finally, in many applications, such as the climate and environment preservation, cooperation between many individuals is required to reach a sustainable path, while the temptation to over-use resources is strong. Our game reflects this with its public goods character when there is more than one decision maker. We derive equilibrium behavior and test the predictions in a lab experiment. Our experimental design includes a single versus multi-player game treatment to assess the role of strategic interactions and a high versus low threshold treatment. We want to investigate whether sustainability is achieved more often when it is an equilibrium strategy, and how different personality traits moderate the chosen strategies."
