abstract: "This study examines the impact of modifications to the Transferencia a Primera Infancia (TPI) in urban areas. The TPI is a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program available to households that are part of the JUNTOS program (Peru’s flagship CCT program) and have a pregnant woman or a child less than 12 months old. The study will examine the impact of increasing the benefit amount on household welfare, child health, and child cognitive development. "
