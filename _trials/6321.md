abstract: "The aim of this project is to evaluate the use of nudges to improve households’ food choices towards healthier options in a real shopping framework. Data for the analysis come from a big supermarket that keeps track of purchases made by clients who are members of its loyalty program. We hypothesize that customers will improve the nutritious quality of food choices when provided with weekly messages reminding them about the importance of eating healthy food, suggesting simple ways to include them in the family’s menu, and encouraging them to take these tips into action. In particular, messages designed to highlight and promote the consumption of fruits, vegetables, grains, seeds, nuts, legumes and fish, and cooking at home, are expected to have an impact on the composition of grocery purchases, increasing items promoted and reducing less healthy food choices.
