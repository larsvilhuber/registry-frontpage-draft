abstract: "This school-level clustered randomized control study tests the efficacy of WhatsApp-based supports for early childhood educators bringing about remote learning across five regions in Peru during the 2021 school year. Teachers in treatment schools across five regions will receive messages over the course of 8 weeks rooted in behavioral science principles to encourage (1) effective communication with the parents of students, and (2) giving feedback to students about their learning. The study will address the following research questions:
1. What is the impact of the intervention on early educators’ implementation of remote learning?
2. Does the intervention have downstream effects on children’s engagement in remote learning and their development?
3. Does the efficacy of the intervention vary across children, teachers, and schools? "
