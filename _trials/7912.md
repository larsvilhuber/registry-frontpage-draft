abstract: "Hiring algorithms are designed to help companies save time and resources in recruitment. Higher efficiency, however, might come at a cost of fairness, i.e. create disparities across social groups. In this experiment, we investigate how people perceive efficiency vs. fairness trade-off in personnel selection in a STEM context. We vary the degree of the tradeoff and explore the role of the (incentivized) beliefs on ground truth difference in qualifications across genders and on the backgroun inequalities of gender composition of he labour force."
