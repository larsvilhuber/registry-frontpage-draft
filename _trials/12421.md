abstract: "I conduct an experiment with UC Berkeley students and affiliates to test conditions under which experiences with one type of green technology impact beliefs and preferences towards other green technologies.

Participants are randomized into treated and control groups, where treated subjects are made to have a negative experience with green technology. Following treatment, subject beliefs on five classes of green technology are surveyed.

I also test whether treatment increased the amount subjects are willing to donate to one of three randomly chosen non-profits: a generalist non-environmental one, a generalist environmental one, and a specialized environmental one.

To limit potential demand effects, response data will be withheld from the researchers who directly interact with subjects while experiments are underway.
