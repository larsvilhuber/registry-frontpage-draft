abstract: "Mangroves are invaluable ecosystems that offer a diverse range of benefits, including carbon sequestration, coastal protection, and providing habitats for various species. However, these ecosystems are under significant threat from human activities and require conservation efforts, particularly as coastal populations heavily rely on them for their livelihoods.

This study employs a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the potential impact of an influential singer's message on individuals' willingness to contribute for a conservation program of mangrove forests in a coastal area in the Sofala province, in Mozambique. The research design involves a control group exposed to a video highlighting general information about the benefits of mangroves. In contrast, the treatment group will be shown an additional video featuring a message from an influential singer emphasizing the crucial importance of conserving mangroves, and a call to action for everyone to be engaged. After watching the videos, participants will be asked to respond to a contingent valuation question, expressing their maximum willingness to pay or willingness to work for the conservation of mangrove forests in the study site.

This study aims to shed light on the effectiveness of using influential figures in promoting the conservation of natural resources. By exploring how targeted messages delivered through video interventions can shape individuals' environmental attitudes and willingness to contribute to conservation efforts, the findings will provide a deeper understanding of public behavior towards environmental preservation. Moreover, the results will have significant implications for designing effective communication strategies aimed at mobilizing public support and funding for the conservation of natural resources in Mozambique.
