abstract: "In this study, I test whether endorsement by political leaders affects peopleâ€™s perception about COVID-19 vaccine and vaccine intention and whether the effect varies by the affiliation of the politicians. I conduct a randomized controlled trial among 4500 households in Bangladesh. The three arms of the RCT are: (1) the households in the first group receive information about the COVID-19 symptoms, risks, prevention, and vaccination (2) the households in the second group receive the same information and are informed that key ruling party leaders also received the vaccine, and (3) the households in the third group receive the same information and are informed that key opposition party leaders also received the vaccine. This document outlines the research methodology, the outcome variables, and the analysis plan. "
