abstract: "In this trial, we want to test if knowledge regarding partial funding for a social innovation project in Austria from a national public funding agency, the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG), influences the likelihood of participants to invest in a crowdfunding campaign for social innovation projects, compared to just hearing about the crowdfunding campaign itself. The trial will consist of a series of emails to participants, in which new social innovation projects of various SMEs are introduced along with 30 day crowdfunding campaigns hosted on the platform Startnext. There is one control group, and who receives only the previous information, and 2 Treatment groups. Treatment group 1 will receive emails with an additional text saying that the social innovation project will receive Matched funding up to 50% of their project goal from the FFG. Treatment group 2 will receive emails with an additional text saying that the social innovation projects have received seed funding of 50% of the project costs already. Participants are individuals living and working in Austria who have previously signed up for email correspondence from the FFG.
