abstract: "Our project facilitates public understanding of law by making legal documents transparent to the public through a novel system built with artificial intelligence. In this study, we quantify the effect of public understanding of the law on online discourse through field experiments randomizing the availability of legal document summaries. We will randomly assign some social media posts to receive accessible summaries. We will then compare on-platform engagement for treated conversations that received the accessible summaries relative to control conversations. "
