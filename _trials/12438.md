abstract: "We conduct a field-based survey experiment toward 1,741 local governments in Japan. In the experiment, for each local government, we ask both of staffs at the department of health and budget officers at the department of finance to answer the survey. We randomly divide the local governments into four groups. We set in the survey a hypothetical question, where the survey respondents are asked to consider conducting HPV vaccine promotion programs. The four groups consist of three treatment groups and one control group. The three treatment groups are A) matching grant, B) social comparison nudge, and C) both. After the question, we ask staffs at the department of health to decide how much to apply for the budget, and we also ask budget officers at the department of finance how much to assess the budget at. Furthermore, we investigate whether the effects are heterogeneous by local governments’ and staffs’ characteristics."
