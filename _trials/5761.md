abstract: "We examine how information from trusted social media sources can shape beliefs and behaviors when misinformation and mistrust is widespread. In the context of the COVID-19 outbreak in Zimbabwe, we partner with a highly reputable civil society organization to randomize the dissemination of misinformation-targeting messages about the crisis to over 27,000 newsletter subscribers through WhatsApp. We randomize the timing of the message dissemination to evaluate how exposure to these targeted messages affect citizensâ€™ beliefs about how to deal with the crisis and their associated behavior. We also explore how these effects may vary by gender and rurality."
