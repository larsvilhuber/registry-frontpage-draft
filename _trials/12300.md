abstract: "
We have already conducted a series of surveys through Lucid on individualsâ€™ demographics, connections on a digital platform, and their valuations of these connections and digital platforms. 

In this document we are pre-registering a follow-up survey and analysis plan. The survey will collect information on 2,500 users of each of four popular social media platforms (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter/X, and LinkedIn), with a focus on their number of contacts, valuation of the platform, social media usage, and other socio-economic and demographic information. 

The first question we are interested in is the relationship between the number of contacts and platform valuation. Our main specification will be a linear regression with an intercept term. In secondary specifications we will replace the number of contacts with the log of the number of contacts, and include additional linear controls. 

We are also interested in how platform valuations vary with socio-economic, demographic and platform usage characteristics, as well as question framing. Our main analysis will first select covariates (and their interactions) with explanatory power using LASSO. We will then run a regression of platform valuation on the LASSO selected coefficients and interactions. As secondary specifications, we will estimate how the average platform valuation varies by demographically defined sub-groups.
