abstract: "This research project addresses experimentally as well as theoretically whether decision makers state more selfish decisions if they are protected by the anonymity of the mass and the consequences of their decisions affect a collective of economic agents compared to a situation where they interact with solely one agent? 

This presumed increase in selfish behavior is backed up by predictions derived from an adapted versions of the simple guilt and the guilt from blame model by Batigalli and Dufwenberg (2007). In other words, differences in how decision makers experience feelings of guilt and shame for not living up to the expectations of others may differ in multi-agent settings. The concept of guilt offers four different behavioral channels for a potential increase in selfish behavior. 

A dictator game experiment is ran on mturk to approach the main research question as well as to disentangle the different potential behavioral channels. In order to address the main hypothesis, the number of dictators & recipient within one group is varied. In order to discriminate between different behavioral channel, the strategy method (dictators state their decisions contingent on different expectations of recipients) is applied, the post-experimental feedback is varied and first order beliefs about the behavior of other dictators are elicited.
