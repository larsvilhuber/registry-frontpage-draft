abstract: "This document describes the pre-analysis plan for a randomized experiment examining the effects of narratives accompanying unconditional cash transfers on self-concept and economic behavior. We provided one-time, unconditional cash transfers to residents of two informal settlements in Nairobi and randomly assign participants to receive one of three messages. Respondents will receive a non-binding message stating that the cash is intended for 1) poverty alleviation, 2) individual empowerment, or 3) community empowerment. We then collected self-reported measures of self-efficacy, stigma, and affect and behavioral measures of future-orientation, self-investment, and program support. This pre-analysis plan outlines our hypotheses, the schedule of experimental tasks, and our empirical strategy. In order to guarantee transparency and bind ourselves from fishing for results, we will pre-register the scripts to be used for data analysis."
