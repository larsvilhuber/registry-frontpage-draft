abstract: "We are connected with others in the world. By using connections with others, we can strengthen cooperation and our community resilience. Without connections, it is not easy to cooperate with others. In this study, we focus on measuring the effect of networks on cooperative actions in human groups in the repeated prisoner's dilemma. In particular, we compare the cooperation performances of communication and networks in the repeated games. Also, we analyze the relationship between network robustness and cooperative actions in human groups in the repeated prisoner's dilemma. We design online experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk."
