abstract: "The study aims to investigate changes in forcasting behavior depending on varying characteristics of the underlying process that participants are forecasting. In a laboratory environment, they are exposed to processes that vary in the number of endogenous variables, persistence of external shocks and whether the dynamics of the forecasting environment is described in technical or non-technical language. The goal is to document systematic patterns in human predictions that depend on the nature of the environment.
