abstract: "The long-run price elasticity of demand for credit is a key parameter for
intertemporal modeling, policy levers, and lending practice. We use
randomized interest rates, offered across 80 regions by Mexico’s largest
microlender, to identify a 29-month dollars-borrowed elasticity of -1.9.
This elasticity increases from -1.1 in year one to -2.9 in year three. The
number of borrowers is also elastic. Credit bureau data does not show
evidence of crowd-out. Competitors do not respond by reducing rates,
perhaps because Compartamos’ profits are unchanged. The results are
consistent with multiple equilibria in loan pricing."
