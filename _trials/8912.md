abstract: "Labor market integration of refugees, a critical step towards their self-reliance and local integration, can be impeded by local perceptions of labor market competition in an environment where job opportunities are limited. This, in addition to anti-refugee rhetoric stressing rivalry over job opportunities, may contribute to resentments, mistrust, and discrimination between refugees and hosts. To date, it is unclear whether perceptions of labor market competition between refugees and hosts compromise community-building efforts across the two groups. Our study seeks to evaluate whether perceptions of labor market competition negatively influence out-group attitudes. We use a randomized questionnaire module that exposes the survey respondents to narratives about the out-group, stressing either differences or commonalities in the labor market characteristics between the respondent and a fictitious in-group or out-group individual."
