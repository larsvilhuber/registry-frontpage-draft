abstract: "The police maintain the state's monopoly of legitimate force and much of their authority rests on them acting as the guardians of democracy. If the police abuse their power by expressing xenophobic views, they risk eroding the public's trust. Higher education is often seen as a tool to reduce prejudice, suggesting that an educated police force should result in more tolerant police officers. At the same time, the education system socializes students into an existing police culture which may counteract this effect–if the culture contains xenophobic tendencies.

This project examines the causal impact of integrating police students with different racial stereotypes on the students’ subsequent stereotypes, attitudes, and academic performance. The impact will be assessed by randomly assigning police students at the police academy to study partners based on their initial racial stereotypes. Because the police force is a traditionally male-dominated environment, we will pay special attention to student gender."
