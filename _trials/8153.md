abstract: "Individuals exhibit a preference for conformity in various domains, including effort provision (Bandiera, Barankay, and Rasul, 2010), charitable giving (Frey and Meier, 2004), energy consumption (Allcott, 2011), and so on. This preference, as an important behavioral motivator, has been widely used in the literature on nudging, whereby normative or descriptive information of an action may affect individual decision making. Theoretical studies commonly model the preference for conformity as concerns for social image (Bernheim, 1994; Benabou and Tirole, 2006) or difference from others (Akerlof, 1980; Jones, 1984). There are some essential questions remaining to be explored. Is this preference driven by intrinsic or instrumental motivation? If it is the latter case, is there any misperception on social norms toward disconformity? This trial aims at identifying and decomposing the motivators for conformity. In a multiple-stage experiment, subjects make binary decisions on charitable giving in three circumstances: (1) one-shot decision; (2) conditional on the proportion of choosing to donate in the one-shot decision; (3) under third-party punishment and conditional on the proportion of choosing to donate in the one-shot decision. We will also elicit subjectsâ€™ belief on third-party punishment. "
