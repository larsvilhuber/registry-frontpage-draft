abstract: "Access to tertiary education among students enrolled in schools located in socioeconomically-disadvantaged areas is still limited. This fact tends to perpetuate inequalities. In this project, we study the impact of providing one-to-one mentoring sessions to students starting their last year of high school by randomly allocating a subset of students from over 50 schools in Catalonia to voluntary mentors who are college students or graduates. We focus on the effects of our intervention on the expectations of these students about the likelihood of attending university or vocational education and of direct entry into the labor force and about the pecuniary and non-pecuniary returns of these three options."
