abstract: "The goal of the study is to study parental information frictions in making school type decisions for their children by providing different types of mobile information material regarding the secondary school choice. Previous evidence shows that in Germany, children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are underrepresented in the academic school track \citep{Woßmann2023, Blanden2023}. Also, children of immigrants often perform worse in school and have lower academic track choices than their native peers (Ammermüller, 2007; Wößmann, 2023). Their gap could even be widened by a lack of the host country's language skills of the students (Danzer, 2022) or the parents (Bleakley, 2008)  and negative stereotypes (Carlana 2018). This study is the first to analyze whether a lack of knowledge about the German school system as well as linguistic barriers (that might cause this lack), hinders native and immigrant parents from making an informed decision about their children’s school track."
