abstract: "Understanding the costs and benefits of discretionary compared to rule-based decision-making is at the core of organizational economics. We set up a field experiment in a network of 241 supermarkets to generate causally interpretable evidence on the trade-offs involved.
 
Consider a team headed by a store manager M who reports to his principal P. M observes both the aggregate output of the team and individual contributions of its members, whereas P observes only the aggregate output. Should P distribute the reward equally between the team members, thus ignoring M's knowledge of the members' individual contributions, or should P give M the discretion to distribute the reward?
 
We will allow the managers in randomly selected stores to decide on the bonus distribution within their stores, while in the rest of the stores the bonus will be distributed equally. The size of the bonus to be awarded to each store is determined by a firm-wide rule, which is based on the store's results and performance and is known to all. Our treatment will start on July 1st 2016.
 
What is the effect of giving discretion over bonus distribution on the store performance outcomes, in particular, sales and employee turnover? On one hand, discretion will make use of the manager's knowledge, which should improve performance. On the other hand, there is a risk of favouritism and a possibility that managers may overlook important interactions between individual contributions.  
 
We expect the treatment effect to be heterogeneous. "
