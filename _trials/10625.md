abstract: "With 1.35 million road fatalities worldwide every year, of which 90% occur in developing countries, the epidemic of road safety has become an absolute priority for economic development. The World Bank defined “tackling the road safety crisis as both a moral imperative and an economic necessity”. Traditional economics suggests that speeding behaviors, a highly consequential risk-taking choice, trade off an increase in profits for serving more customers with higher fuel, maintenance and (potentially) healthcare costs. Yet, we have limited empirical evidence about why suppliers of transportation in low-income settings systematically adopt risky behaviors. 

This project considers beliefs about driving behaviors among motor-taxi drivers, the most common supplier of transportation in the metropolitan area of Kampala, Uganda. Drivers operate in semiformal clusters. As a result, peer cultures related to the driving behavior may find fertile ground and perhaps affect productivity.
In this survey experiment, I test whether motor-taxi drivers perceive speeding behavior as a signal for earnings, ability, and social status among peers. To get to the causal impact of speeding on perceived social and monetary returns, I create triplets of identical profiles based on real drivers, except for randomly-manipulated speeding behavior. I ask motor-taxi drivers to rate a random subset of profiles of other motor-taxi drivers along monetary and social status characteristics, as well as their willingness to refer the drivers to their work organization. 
This setting allows testing whether speeding increases the likelihood of being perceived as a high earner and as an individual with high social status within the working station.
