abstract: "A postsecondary credential has become increasingly important in the labor market, and college attendance has grown. Unfortunately, college completion remains less common, particularly in community colleges, which serve many low-income and academically underprepared students who often need remedial (developmental) courses. Previous research on student persistence had highlighted the importance of student "engagement" in a college's academic and social life--particularly during a student's first year. "Learning communities," which emerged in the 1970s, were viewed by many practitioners and researchers as a promising strategy to promote student engagement and retention. Learning communities bring together small groups of students who take two or more linked courses that have mutually reinforcing themes and assignments. Learning communities seek to encourage peer relationships, intensify personal connections to faculty, and foster a deeper mastery of course work.

As part of six-year grant from the Institute of Education Sciences of the U.S. Department of Education to the National Center for Postsecondary Research (NCPR), MDRC and other NCPR research partners conducted a multi-college demonstration of learning communities. The project evaluated the effectiveness of learning communities as a strategy to improve selected educational outcomes for academically underprepared students, such as completion of developmental education requirements and persistence in college.

The demonstration used a random assignment research design to compare the experiences and outcomes of students in the learning communities with those of students not participating in the programs. MDRC and its partners collected data from a variety of sources, including students' academic records, to determine the effects of the programs. Six community colleges participated in the demonstration:

-- The Community College of Baltimore County (Baltimore, Maryland)
-- Hillsborough Community College (Tampa, Florida)
-- Houston Community College (Houston, Texas)
-- Kingsborough Community College (Brooklyn, New York)
-- Merced College (Merced, California)
-- Queensborough Community College (Queens, New York)

Study intake began in fall 2007 and was completed by the end of 2009. During this time, more than 6,000 students participated in the demonstration across the six colleges. An implementation study was conducted to document how the learning communities programs were designed and operated, and to describe the classroom experience from the perspective of teachers and students in the learning communities and regular college programs.
