abstract: "India is choking on growth. Of the 20 cities in the world with the worst fine particulate air pollution, 13 are in India, including Delhi, the worst-ranked city (WHO, 2013). The average Indian loses about three years of his or her life due to the harm of this pollution (Greenstone et al., 2015). There is also growing evidence that high levels of pollution lower labor productivity and, therefore, potentially economic growth (Zivin and Neidell, 2013; Hanna and Oliva, 2015). If good information on who pollutes is available, then traditional environmental regulation can bring down emissions somewhat (Duflo et al., 2013; Duflo et al., 2015), but regulators may lack the will or resources to penalize every polluter. What more can government due to contain such widespread damages?
 
In this project we propose to test this Coasian principle of transparency first by measuring the effect of information disclosure on emissions in a large-scale plant-level randomized-control trial in India. Our partner in the project is the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), the environmental regulator in the most industrialized state in India-Maharashtra. Working jointly with the MPCB, we have developed a star-rating program that will assign plants to categories based on their recent air pollution emissions. The experimental design assigns random subsets of plants to have their ratings privately shared with the plant alone or publicly disclosed, allowing us to distinguish own-knowledge and public pressure effects on the main outcome of plant air pollution emissions. Moreover, unlike in the traditional Coasian setting, here a regulator does exist. We will therefore also measure the effects of public disclosure on the crowd-in or -out of regulatory enforcement actions."
