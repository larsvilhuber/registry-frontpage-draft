abstract: "Cashless payments are ubiquitous, but not for all kinds of economic transactions. When people are asked face-to-face to contribute to charity, presenting a cashless payment option (CPO) may deter individuals from donating. To investigate whether this is a common phenomenon, we conduct a field experiment in the context of an art exhibition at a German university. After taking a guided tour, visitors are asked to fill out a feedback survey and to support the exhibition financially. As part of a 2x2 design, we randomly manipulate the opportunity to donate, either offering the CPO or not. To check whether the findings are special to donations, we additionally implement two pay-what-you-want (PWYW) treatment conditions (with and without CPO) by asking to compensate for the service of the guided tour. In a complementary survey experiment, we manipulate a charitable giving context similar to the one investigated in our field experiment. Contrary to previous considerations, we test whether a CPO might increase charitable donations by taking away the excuse of not having cash available and, hence, raising social pressure. "
