abstract: "China currently has no social welfare programs such as the Earned Income Tax Credits (EITC) in the United States. Yet, the literature and global evidence have suggested EITC-type programs' potentials on poverty alleviation and work incentives. This paper examines the first-ever EITC field experiment in China with strong treatment intensity (20% of household monthly income) and rigorous validation procedure. The two-year experiment on 259 households shows that the participation of the program increases employment by 0.33 person per household (14%) and monthly working hours by 81 hours (40%) per household. We also find significant increases in household earnings and expenditures. These effects are substantially larger than the existing literature partially because of the strong treatment intensity. Our study contributes to a large literature that studies the effect of in-work benefits."
