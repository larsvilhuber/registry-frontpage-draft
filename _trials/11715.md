abstract: "Despite the rapid expansion of branchless banking services across Indonesia over the past few years, there is an overarching concern that low client trust in digital financial services may be hampering demand and limiting financial inclusion. One of the main sources of mistrust in digital financial services is related to the lack of price transparency and the high prevalence of informal fees and illicit extra charges by agents to customers. To shed light on this issue, we partnered with one of Indonesia’s largest banks to (i) measure the consumer demand for price transparency and the extent of financial agent misconduct, and to (ii) estimate the market returns to price transparency. In our experiment, we will study the causal effect of providing clients with information about the bank’s official prices on take-up and usage of products, client perceptions, and agent responses following the diffusion of information about prices.
