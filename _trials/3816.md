abstract: "The project seeks to explore the role of cultural background in explaining the relationship between social capital and attitudes towards voting in local government. There is some evidence linking social capital, taxation attitudes and background but so far it has proved difficult to deal with causation or endogeneity problems in particular those related to culture. We solve this problem in a field setting in which we control for cultural background via a number of novel means."
