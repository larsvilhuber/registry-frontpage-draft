abstract: "Electricity access is a crucial part of the economy, constituting one of the largest inputs to industry, and responsible for significant gains in development outcomes such as education, employment and productivity.  However,  developing countries lack universal electrification and  even  those  who  are  connected,  experience  intermittent  supply.   Solar  mini-grids  and homesystems have been offered as a potential substitute,  or a stop-gap until the grid can be extended and improved.  However, adoption continues to be low, and one of the reasons presented in earlier research is that people may have very low demand for grid alternatives. However, we identify information and trust constraints as significant barriers to adoption and explore that in this study."
