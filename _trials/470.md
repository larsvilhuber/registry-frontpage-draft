abstract: "The Enterprise Support Project is intended to increase the profits and improve the survival rates for participating entrepreneurs. The project is an additional component of two existing entrepreneurship promotion programs supported by the Moroccan government. When the programs were first developed, there was little empirical evidence on the effectiveness of post-creation business training and support. In particular, the extent to which the training increases revenues and augments survival rates of new enterprises was unclear, and, as a consequence, whether the benefits exceed the costs of the program. Such evidence is vital to the future design and funding of the program and to address these information gaps, the project teams decided to pursue a rigorous impact evaluation of the proposed Enterprise Support Project. The objective is to measure the specific contribution of the training and support program on key business outcomes. There have been no rigorous evaluations conducted on similar programs in Morocco. "
