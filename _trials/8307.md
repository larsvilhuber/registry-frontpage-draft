abstract: "In this field study, we assess how people perform on knapsack problems with different levels of theoretical difficulties. Participants will be randomly assigned knapsack problems with varying levels of difficulty. We intend to assess whether problems that are theoretically "more difficult" produce worse solutions in participants and vice versa, as well as whether participants gain proficiency with the knapsack task as over more iterations of the problem. Finally, we plan to study if there are correlations between known characteristics of participants and their performance on the knapsack problem. "
