abstract: "In Japan, the per capita vegetable intake per adult is about 280g, falling short of the 350g target. Long-term inadequate vegetable intake increases the risk of lifestyle-related diseases, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and arteriosclerosis. This study will examine  ways to increase vegetable intake by implementing a commitment intervention to have Japanese consumers set a vegetable intake target. The study will measure the fruit and vegetable intake of approximately 2,000 civil servants working at Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF). The authors  will question approximately 1,000 randomly selected participants from the measured population to set a target for fruit and vegetable intake for the upcoming month. Next, they will be asked to measure their fruit and vegetable intake for that one month to confirm the changes in their intake. Based on the results, we will propose measures to increase fruit and vegetable intake in Japan. To measure fruit and vegetable intake, we will use a vegetable intake-measuring  instrument (Veggie Meter®, Longevity Link Corporation) (Redtke et al.), which can measure the carotenoids in the blood without contact.
