abstract: "Early  childhood care and education (ECCE) is critical to a child's development and their success in adult life. Children who receive quality ECCE are proven to be healthier, do better and stay longer in school, and have better economic trajectories in adult life. In impoverished rural northern Ghana, children do not receive these vital opportunities. Despite recent advances in Ghana’s Education System (GES), two barriers to ECCE persist: (i) Low quality Kinder Garten (KG), marred by a lack of trained teachers, large class sizes, lack of play-based resources, teacher absenteeism and rote-based teaching; and (ii) low level of maternal education, information and aspiration in deprived rural communities. Lively Minds' innovation overcomes both of these challenges by training and empowering official KG teachers and mothers in highly deprived communities to set up and run educational play schemes (covering hygiene and stimulation) using local materials. To achieve sustainability, scalability and cost-effectiveness, play schemes are mainstreamed into and are designed to strengthen the Government KG system and are based on a training of trainers approach. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), in partnership with Innovation for Poverty Action (Ghana) will design and implement a randomised controlled trial in 80 rural communities in Northern and Upper East regions of Ghana, to evaluate impacts of the Lively Minds programme on the targeted children, their siblings and caregivers, volunteer mothers who run the play-schemes and teachers who train the volunteer mothers. The study will evaluate impacts on target child’s physical, cognitive and socio-emotional development, as well as the home environment and primary caregiver’s knowledge, perceptions and well-being. The evidence provided by this evaluation will be crucial for determining whether there is value in mainstreaming the programme across Ghana and replicating it in other countries."
