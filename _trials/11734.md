abstract: "The investigators will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial in secondary schools in Nigeria to evaluate the impact of school-based life skills training delivered in safe spaces with and without digital literacy training. This study aims to estimate the causal impacts of the training on adolescents' school performances and retention, socio-emotional skills, digital skills, health, marriage, fertility, and labor market outcomes.
