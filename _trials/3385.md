abstract: "While evidence from Brazil suggests that SMS messages to nudge parents’ engagement in their children’s education have large effects on educational outcomes, such an intervention might not work as intended in poorer settings, for at least two reasons: parents have a much higher likelihood of being illiterate – such that text-based interventions may fail to induce behavior change –, and teachers have less formal training and a much higher probability of being absent from schools – such that learning outcomes may not improve even if student’s attendance increases. This paper investigates whether those reasons are critical constraints for transferring the intervention across settings, in the context of Ivory Coast, by randomly assigning whether parents receive nudges over text or voice messages, and by cross-randomizing nudges across parents and teachers.
