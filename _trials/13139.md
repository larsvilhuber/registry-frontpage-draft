abstract: "How does a person's perception of their own place in the income distribution influence their support for redistribution? How does a person's perception of the level of inequality in society, in a highly unequal society, influence their support for redistribution? In this project we will test two interventions within a survey to study the questions presented above, in the context of Colombia's five biggest cities. We will also study how citizens' general trust as well as trust in government institutions influence their support for redistribution. We will further analyze citizens support for raising different taxes, their perception of the Colombian tax system, and tax evasion. We will test the hypothesis that individuals higher in the income distribution than they expected will be less supportive of redistribution. We will also test the hypothesis that individuals made aware of the level of income inequality in their society will be more supportive of redistribution and more polarized. "
