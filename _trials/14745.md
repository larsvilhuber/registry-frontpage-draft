abstract: "In this project, we want to investigate the general perception of discrimination in financial services. In particular, we want to find out whether individuals anticipate disparate treatments and outcomes in financial advice situations and what they perceive to be the reason for this. To do so, we run an online survey (Prolific) in which we elicit individuals' experiences with financial advice, perceptions about potential or experienced discrimination, ideas of potentially underlying reasons, as well as strategies to avoid discrimination. While we focus on gender discrimination in financial advice situations, we also ask about discrimination in other domains and across alternative group attributes."
