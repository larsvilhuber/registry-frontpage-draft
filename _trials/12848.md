abstract: "Centre for Net Zero (CNZ), in partnership with Octopus Energy France, will undertake a field trial during Winter 2023 - 2024. The trial will rigorously evaluate the price sensitivity of demand flexibility response from domestic customers in France.

We are building on the success of previous campaigns in the UK 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 Saving Sessions, which showcased domestic customers' willingness to curtail energy consumption during peak periods, and CNZâ€™s analysis thereof (Jacob et al., 2023). The French Eco-sessions is a scale-up from research in the UK and taking it to another country."
