abstract: "The aim of our study is to understand the role of social norms and individual beliefs about social norms for people’s decision to recycle. In cooperation with a local municipality in Lima, Peru, we will conduct a field experiment using phone surveys to increase sign-up rates to the municipality’s recycling programme. We will make use of different types of social norm information to motivate sign-ups of households, focussing on injunctive and dynamic norm information. We will do so in a 2x2 design, with injunctive norm information on the one side (no/yes) and dynamic norm information on the other side (no/yes), testing both the individual and the combined effect of the two distinct norm messages. Moreover, we will investigate the role of individual pre-treatment beliefs about injunctive and dynamic norms for the response to our information treatments that directly aim at correcting those beliefs. Our primary outcomes of interest will be i) people’s sign-up decision during the phone survey and ii) people’s actual sign-up through the official registration link that they will receive from the municipality shortly after the survey. We are interested in the average treatment effects of our social norm treatment messages as well as heterogeneous treatment effects as a result of individual level belief updating about dynamic and/or injunctive norms, depending on the treatment."
