abstract: "Homicide is rampant in Latin America and the Caribbean. This project has a two-fold objective. First, it will provide evidence on the impact of an effort to protect at-risk youth in Guatemala through empowerment. This is implemented through a randomized individual-level intervention on the role of self-expression in shaping behavior among the youth living in areas festered with violence and lack of access to opportunities. For this purpose, the participation in a mass-media campaign will serve as main source of variation. Second, it aims to understand the role of media in the fight against gangs, by varying throughout the country the exposure to the mass-media among youth. To capture this, this project will exploit semi-random variation in the reception of radio and tv signals through topography, and random variation through social media."
