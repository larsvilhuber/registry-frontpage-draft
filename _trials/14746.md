abstract: "This study aims to examine how trust and trustworthiness measures, both experimental and survey-based, are impacted by electoral outcomes. We will conduct a three-wave experiment (before elections, immediately after, and three months post-election) using a binary trust game and survey questionnaires. The study will investigate how political affiliation and electoral expectations interact with trust measures following electoral results. Participants will be recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), with data collection occurring across three distinct time periods surrounding a major election."
