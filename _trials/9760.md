abstract: "Light affects levels of serotonin. Ample evidence has explored the effect of light on eating behavior. Previous literature has also revealed that levels of serotonin affect preferences for fairness (Crockett 2008). More broadly, serotonin can affect mood, sleep, and other health measures (Young 2007) as well as the types of food consumed (Blundell et al 1995). A recently conducted pilot reveals that a student population reveals stronger preferences for fairness in the light than in the dark. In this study, we confirm the findings of this pilot study, varying the amount of light in the room while exploring the classical games where preferences for fairness may be detected and evaluating the payment schemes. We also explore the effects both in a student population and a non-student, general adult population."
