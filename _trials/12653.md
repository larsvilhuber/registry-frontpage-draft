abstract: "In this study, we explore the effectiveness of online job portals in reducing youth unemployment in rural India, focusing on the Work India platform. This randomized controlled trial of around 500 trainees from 20 vocational training batches in Bihar, predominantly targeting marginalized groups like females and scheduled castes and tribes. The intervention consists of hands-on training on using Work India, contrasting with control groups that receive no such training. Our aim is to assess whether this training enhances job awareness and aligns job preferences with actual opportunities, potentially improving employment outcomes for disadvantaged youth. This research offers valuable
insights into the impact of digital job search tools on the employment prospects of disadvantaged youth in developing countries, contributing to the broader discourse on scalable solutions for youth unemployment."
