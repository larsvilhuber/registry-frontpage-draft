abstract: "Rural households in Sub-Saharan Africa face a number of binding constraints in agricultural production, including access to improved land, irrigation, improved seeds and fertilizer.  And where household members do not cooperate fully in their productive decisions, and women's access to the means of production is mainly through their husbands, women’s agricultural activities may be further constrained by less access to inputs, services, and credit relative to men. 

The study randomly allocates access to irrigated plots of land via rental arrangement with Ariku Farms among interested households. And within each household to which Ariku Farms provides a land rental and/or inputs contract, we will randomly allocate the contract to either the husband or the wife. 

The study’s key aim is to provide evidence on whether providing direct access for women to productive inputs alters production or consumption patterns in the household, including whether or not aggregate output, productivity, and intra-household efficiency increases. The study will also provide evidence on gains from access to irrigation, and will explore a number of secondary questions using incentivized lab-in-the-field measures.
