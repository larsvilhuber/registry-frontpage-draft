abstract: "We study the effect of topic familiarity on test performance in standardized English tests. The hypothesis is that test performance is capturing more than ability, and it is being confounded with familiarity, which in turn is affected by SES, gender, race, and other cultural factors. If this is the case, then these tests are acting as unfair gatekeepers to important economic opportunities. We test these hypotheses in this project by eliciting baseline topic familiarity and also experimentally varying familiarity."
