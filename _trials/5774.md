abstract: "Norms are important determinants of human behavior, and many decisions entail normative trade-offs. This project conjectures that people are inclined to base their actions more heavily on norms which are beneficial for themselves. In particular, this extends to situations where people are unaffected by their own actions but subject to the actions of others. A (virtual) laboratory experiment is conducted to establish the existence of the proposed effect."
