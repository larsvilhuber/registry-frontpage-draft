abstract: "Do managers' messaging style in manager-employee group chats affect employee outcomes and behavior? We use detailed WhatsApp group chat data from a government-sponsored education intervention in Pakistan to investigate our hypothesis. We investigate the effect of managers' messaging style on teacher and student outcomes and teacher perceptions, mediated by within-group-chat teacher participation and solidarity. Our research will contribute to the broader management literature around the effect of transformational vs. transactional leadership styles on employee outcomes. "
