abstract: "The study comprises a natural field experiment on the effect of peer networks, and especially friends, and gamification on mobilizing private voluntary funding of climate mitigation projects and eco start-ups. The objectives of this study are threefold: (1) enhancing the visibility of crowdfunding projects, (2) motivating individual financial involvement (ego mechanism) and (3) stimulating a given individual’s social network, that is, its impact on studying the diffusion among participants’ friends (alter mechanism). The experiment focuses on two different types of crowdfunding: (1) reward based crowdfunding and (2) donation based crowdfunding."
