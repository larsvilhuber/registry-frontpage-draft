abstract: "This study is designed to increase understanding of how intra-household dynamics and gender impact savings. As part of this study, we offer mobile-phone based bank savings accounts that are linked to mobile money to married men and women in Ghanaâ€™s Volta region.  

In order to answer our research questions, we plan to randomly vary three elements: (i) whether a liquidity restriction on the account is binding; (ii) spousal information regarding which liquidity restriction is in place; and (iii) the value of incentive payments for choosing a binding versus non-binding liquidity restrictions.  

The first set of research questions will look at the demand curve for hard vs soft commitment; the correlation between baseline characteristics and demand for hard vs soft commitment; the extent to which the spousal information treatment impacts demand for hard vs soft commitment; and how all of these vary by gender. The second set of research questions will look at impacts on savings, including: how the spousal information treatment impacts savings; how the hard commitment treatment impacts savings; the interaction between the hard commitment treatment and the spousal information treatment; and the impact of perceived (but not actual) binding commitment from the perspective of the spouse.
