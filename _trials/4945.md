abstract: "Hirschman's (1970) seminal thesis that enabling worker ``voice'' prevents exit from the employment relationship has played a foundational role in labor economics. We conduct the first experimental test of this hypothesis in a real-world setting via a randomized controlled trial in Indian garment factories. Just after what proved to be a disappointing wage hike, workers were chosen at random to participate in an anonymous survey in which they were asked for feedback on job conditions, supervisor performance, and overall job satisfaction. We investigate how enabling voice in this manner affected turnover and absenteeism after the hike."
