abstract: "Firms in developing countries often rank low on management quality scales. What prevents firms to invest in management quality? A central hypothesis in the economics literature is that, in many contexts, product market competition is low and that low-intensity competition dampens firms’ incentives to improve the quality of their management.  In this project, we experimentally test whether the threat of competition changes firms’ decision to invest in management training: we randomly provide a treatment designed to increase perceived competition in the product market, and study its impacts on the demand for management training among firms in urban Ethiopia.
