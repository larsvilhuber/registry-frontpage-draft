abstract: "Firearms have become the leading cause of death among U.S. children rising 50% between 2019 and 2021 (Pew Research, 2023). There are now more firearms in America than people (approximately 400 million) and one-quarter of teachers reported an active shooter event in the last 12 months (Pew Research 2024; The Trace, 2024). Despite these sobering statistics, there is limited rigorous social science research understanding why Americans own lethal firearms (LFA) and the degree to which this demand reflects fully informed and considered decisions. This study uses a large-scale survey with obfuscated screening to recruit firearm and non-firearm owners and conduct a survey experiment. Firearm owners are randomized into one of four groups: a control group, a treatment group receiving information about the legal and health-related costs of LFA ownership, a group exposed to information about a non-lethal firearm alternative, or a group receiving the non-lethal firearm alternative information along with an endorsement from a conservative personality. Non-firearm owners are randomized into a control group or a treatment group receiving the legal and health-related costs information. We will compare outcomes across these groups, including beliefs, behaviors, and policy views. A follow-up survey will assess recall, behavioral changes, and potential non-lethal firearm acquisition.
