abstract: "Many college students struggle with mental health concerns, such as anxiety or a lack of belonging, and are often unaware of on-campus support services. The recent, rapid shift from in-person to online learning caused by the COVID-19 pandemic potentially exacerbates these issues. Focus-group evidence in the spring of 2020 from over 500 students at a large Canadian university shows that many students experienced loneliness, lacked structure, and felt unmotivated to continue coursework online when COVID-19 lockdown measures began. Motivated by these findings, we then designed an online module and text-messaging platform to help students navigate these problems, experimentally evaluating the effects of the program on mental health, well-being, and GPA in a sample of over 1,600 students enrolled in courses at two large Canadian universities during the summer of 2020. In addition to course grades, outcomes include self-reported measures of overall physical and mental health. "
