abstract: "This study evaluates the impact of a short-term intervention called CYBATHLON@school on attitudes towards STEM subjects and STEM careers for primary school students in Switzerland. The short-term intervention will be administered with primary school children in fourth to sixth grade. The intervention consists of two workshops. The first workshop is in the class-room with teachers, where students have a 2-hour lesson about the challenges that disabled people face in their everyday life and how they can come up with solutions to help them. The second workshop lasts for half a day and is supervised by trained instructors and an ambassador with a disability. The workshop involves experiencing challenges such as using a wheel-chair, as well as programming robots linked to sensors used in prosthetic arms.
We perform a randomized controlled trial where randomization is conducted on a continuous basis between Spring 2024 and Autumn 2025.  In total, we expect 80 classes with around 20 students to be involved, with 40 classes undergoing the treatment. To assess the influence of the intervention, we will conduct a survey collecting data on students’ attitudes towards STEM school subjects and STEM careers. We will administer three surveys: one before treatment as a baseline, one shortly after the intervention to measure short-term effects and one after three months. Control classes receive the treatment three months delayed.
