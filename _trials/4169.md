abstract: "This research project is being conducted on the program beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries of the Targeting the Ultra Poor Program (TUP) program implemented in Bangladesh. As a social protection program, TUP program provides consumption support and soft loan (interest rate is comparatively low (20%) and repayment starts after two months of taking the loan, interest rate is about 28% for conventional microfinance program) along with livelihood and life skill training, provides savings, health and legal services to move the poor out of poverty. All the supports are channelled through the main female member of the households. Studies have shown that this program has sustainable impact on income, self-employment, food security, and asset base (Bandiera et al 2016). In this study, our aim is to explore whether these supports have any impact on improving confidence and risk taking capability of the poor women."
