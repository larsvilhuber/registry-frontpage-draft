abstract: "To what extent the support of environmental policies reflects differences in individual time and risk preferences is an outstanding question, which is important for both the design of successful climate policies and to induce behavioral changes required to achieve climate goals. In this study, we design an information provision experiment that activates individual time or risk preferences, by asking individuals to estimate the timing or likelihood of extreme temperatures in their state and for a subset of them providing information about the latest scientific estimates of the timing or likelihood, before asking about their support for climate policies and intended behaviors.
