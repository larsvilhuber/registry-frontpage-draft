abstract: "The purpose of this study is to examine whether the adaptive learning component of one type of widely used EdTech – computer-assisted learning (CAL) – is effective at improving student achievement in developing countries. We have three specific objectives. First, we seek to determine whether adaptive CAL (versus regular non-adaptive CAL and versus a pure control group with no CAL) can increase average levels of student achievement. Second, we seek to determine whether adaptive CAL can increase student achievement among different subgroups (primarily for students at different by achievement levels—thus examining whether adaptive CAL reduces achievement gaps—but also by family wealth and gender). Third, we seek to determine whether adaptive CAL can improve students’ secondary outcomes such as attitudes towards learning."
