abstract: "The purpose of this experiment is to determine if prospective job applicants discriminate in their choice of whether to apply for jobs based on the perceived race of the employer.

We will partner with a black owned company to place an employment ad for for an administrative assistant position.  The advertisement will include instructions to email a company contact for more details on the position and application instructions. After an applicant is hired, a demographic survey will be sent to everyone who requested more information.  

Respondents will be randomized to receipt of more job details including either:

[VERSION 1] "Thank you for your interest in a position with [COMPANY]."
[VERSION 2] "Thank you for your interest in a position with [COMPANY], a Black owned company."

The outcome measured will be the proportion of people who applied for the position after receiving more information in each treatment, broken down by the race of the prospective applicant."
