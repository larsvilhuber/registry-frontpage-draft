abstract: "This experimental study investigates the causal effect of a teacher capacity building program that promotes blended instruction, on student learning. It will be implemented in government schools in Haryana, India, in collaboration with a large, local NGO ("Avanti Fellows"). The program's objective is to positively affect the instruction of mathematics and science, in grades nine and ten. The study hypothesizes that student learning improves if teachers are given resources and training, to enrich their instruction with video-based learning materials. Secondly, the study hypothesizes that the intervention's cost-effectiveness outperforms that of an alternative model of teacher capacity building, which does not rely on infrastructure upgrades and uses printed workbooks only."
