abstract: "When governments cannot perfectly enforce taxation, they may seek to exchange services for voluntary citizen tax compliance. This fiscal contract requires that tax morale responds to public service provision. In this paper, we present experimental evidence of the impact of local public infrastructure on tax compliance, leveraging a large public investment experiment and individual property tax records from Mexico City."
