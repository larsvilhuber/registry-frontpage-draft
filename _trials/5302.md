abstract: "The purpose of the study is to explore the effect that the design of income based repayment plans have on student loan repayment plan choice. To do this I field a survey to undergraduate students. In the survey students are then asked to choose between a 10 year repayment plan and an income based repayment plan. The specific design of the income based repayment plan is randomized for each respondent. After the respondents choose a plan they are then asked for information that might affect their choice including information on their: expectations, financial aid, demographics, risk aversion, and educational information."
