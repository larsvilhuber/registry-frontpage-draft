abstract: "Pigouvian taxes are politically difficult to introduce at a high enough rate because of opposition from the public. Subsidies on the other hand are often popular. How will a combination of tax and subsidies be considered by ordinary people, compared to each of the policy instruments in isolation? Will a combination of a tax and a subsidy generate less public opposition than tax alone? Is there a difference in the support if the combination is more tax than subsidies or if there is more subsidies than tax? We investigate this in an online interactive experiment. "
