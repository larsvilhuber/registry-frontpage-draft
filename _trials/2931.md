abstract: "I will conduct a field experiment to analyze the effect of endogenous information acquisition on the intensity of the racial preferences in dating in the UK. I will compare the number and length of messages received by users in two treatments. In the first one, users get paid attention randomly, whereas in the second one agents' attention is chosen exogenously. I will compare the users' behaviour with the theoretical predictions derived from recent work on optimal information acquisition (Bartos et al, 2017)."
