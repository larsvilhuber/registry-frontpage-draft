abstract: "This evaluation examines the impact of the Complementary Livelihood and Asset Support Scheme (CLASS) - a multi-component productive inclusion intervention on poor, social safety net program beneficiaries in Ghana. To be carried out by the government, the treatment comprises of the provision of microenterprise skills training, start-up lump sum cash grants, mentoring and coaching, and financial inclusion activities. In line with the Graduation Approach, the program seeks to durably lift beneficiaries out of extreme poverty. The evaluation will be based on a randomized phase-in design, with randomization into phases performed at the community level. Impact will be evaluated by comparing outcomes at baseline and at follow-up and between batch-2 and batch-3 communities. Treatment is expected to be staggered by at least one year."
