abstract: "Roads to Success (RTS) is a school and career planning program designed to be implemented for 45 minutes per week in grades 7 through 12. Researchers at Mathematica Policy Research used a random assignment design to estimate the impacts of receiving RTS in grades 7 and 8. Mathematica collected baseline test score data from the end of grade 6 (spring 2007), conducted a student baseline survey at the beginning of grade 7 (fall 2007), and conducted a student follow-up survey at the end of grade 8 (spring 2009). The study explores the short-term impacts of the RTS program on learning and study habits, negative behaviors, early career exploration plans, and career self-efficacy."
