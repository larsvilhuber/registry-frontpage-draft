abstract: "Weather uncertainty amplifies agricultural production risk, and weather forecasts are a technology that can help farmers better cope with such risk with improvements in forecast-skill and increasing weather variability due to climate change. Accurate, granular weather forecasts at seasonal, medium-range and short-range timescales can help farmers form more accurate expectations about upcoming weather. Accurate expectations about upcoming weather could translate into optimal action for eventually-realized weather when farmers are equipped to act on their beliefs. We provide rainfall forecasts to farmers who are users of an existing mobile-phone-based agricultural advisory service, and focus on two aspects of forming beliefs based on weather forecasts and acting on them: (a) we assess farmer’s responses to inaccurate forecasts (false alarms), and whether a light-touch nudge reminding farmers of the probabilistic nature of forecasts impacts these responses and their engagement with the service; (b) we assess whether farmers’ engagement with/trust in the service depends on whether they receive forecasts alone or forecasts along with actionable advice."
