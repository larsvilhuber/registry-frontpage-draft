abstract: "We will explain the entire choice pattern in experiments of preference reversals by combining deliberate randomization with valuation uncertainty. In the experiment, we elicit each subject’s randomization probability between P-bet and $-Bet and valuation uncertainty over the two bets. We also repeat the standard preference reversal experiment. We will show that the choice probabilities calculated from randomization probability and valuation uncertainty can predict the subject’s choice pattern in the preference-reversal experiment.
