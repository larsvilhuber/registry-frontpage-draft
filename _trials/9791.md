abstract: "Using data from an incentivised online survey with nationally representative Italians, we study nativesâ€™ attitudes towards refugees, some sharing a common European identity and some not sharing it, being from outside Europe. The project has three objectives. First, we aim to test if the way the asylum seekers are managed and relocated between the different European countries, affects the attitude towards refugees. To this aim, we prime a reform of the EU refugee legislative framework, which sets more equal allocation rules among member states. Second, we aim to test if the way respondents react to the prime depends on the nationality of the refugees. We vary the cultural/ racial distances of the refugees compared to natives. Third, we test if identity concerns affect the level of trust in refugees of different nationalities. We measure attitudes through real donations in favor of the different groups of refugees, and we proxy the degree of trust towards the groups through a choice over the composition of the donation, between in-kind and cash transfers."
