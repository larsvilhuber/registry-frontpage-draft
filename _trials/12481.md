abstract: "We study a vocation training and asset transfer program that is part of the USAID Titukulane Reslience Food Security Activity in Malawi. in Malawi. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the impacts of participation by eligible youths in Titukulane's TEVET (Technical, Entrepreneurial and Vocational Education and Training) intervention that combines informal vocational training delivered by a local artisan with cash asset transfers. Participation offers were randomized individually after assessment of eligibility by the partner and assignment to potential trainers. We used an oversubscription design: for trainers assigned to more than five eligible and interested potential participants, five individuals were randomly selected to be invited to the program, and the remainder make up the control group.
