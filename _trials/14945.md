abstract: "We plan to administer a survey experiment to extract parents' preference for grades and results from standardized tests when making investments. We plan to randomize participants on prolific to several scenarios where we can control the information they see. We will vary the grades and test results from students, as well as their gender. We will also parents explicitly about their views on grades and exams and whether they make investments depending on whether ability or skill are complements or substitutes. "
