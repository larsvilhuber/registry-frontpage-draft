abstract: "Meritocratic fairness dictates that rewards should be based on performance, while external circumstances should not be taken into account in the attribution of merit. However, it is often hard to disentangle performance and circumstances. An example of this is given by genetics, which can be thought of as a lottery happening at birth that has a considerable impact on later performance. I investigate whether individuals' fairness considerations are sensitive to differences in genetics. In an online incentivized experiment, third parties can redistribute earnings between two workers that performed a mathematical task. Across two treatments, beliefs about the importance of genetics in completing the mathematical task are modified through an information treatment."
