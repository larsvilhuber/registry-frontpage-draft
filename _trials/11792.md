abstract: "We study “moral licensing” as potential driver for sustainable investments. We will run an RCT with 3000-4000 clients of a bank, who will be allocated into one of three treatments. All participants will be asked to allocate 12500€ between a sustainable and a classic fund. In treatment 1, we will provide indiviudals with their own carbon footrprint relative to their peers. In treatment 2 we will ask them to allocate 250€ between themselfes and a carbon offsetting organization afterwards. In treatment 3, participants will only get the carbon offsetting decision as a treatment.
By investigating whether individuals who invest in ESG products give themselves a moral license to engage in less sustainable consumption, we aim to gain insights into potential net negative externalities of sustainable investing.
