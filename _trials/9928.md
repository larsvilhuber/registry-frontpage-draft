abstract: "People living today often have little-to-no incentive to contribute to multi-generational public goods that (primarily) benefit later generations. Prior experimental tests of this proposition have used different versions of the intergenerational goods game to show that many members of today’s generation indeed follow the Nash prediction of zero contributions. Yet, these existing frameworks and experiments abstract from some important features of intergenerational goods (IGG) problems. This paper adds a critical feature where multiple generations can overlap. With overlapping generations, there is a richer strategy space that may make cooperation with future generations sustainable, even among purely self-interested agents. In this project, we aim to study theoretically and experimentally the mechanisms behind why people do (and do not) contribute to intergenerational public goods. Across several experimental conditions, we consider and test mechanisms such as the role of social information, reciprocity, fear of retaliation, and efficiency concerns that can affect the decision to give to the past, present or future – or not give at all.
