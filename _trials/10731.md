abstract: "The RESEA program (Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessment) is a program administered by 48 states in the U.S. that provides Unemployment Insurance (UI) recipients with assistance in finding work through one-on-one appointments with career coaches. While the program has existed for some time, little research is available on the efficacy of the program, or specific services offered to the participants, at improving employment rates or earnings. Starting in March 2023, Montana's Department of Labor and Industry will begin a random control trial investigation to study the impact of supplementing the program with services offered on a virtual platform, "Reemployment Central". Using random assignment, half MT RESEA participants will be placed in a treatment group that will be asked to complete supplemental virtual activities geared towards reemployment prior to attending a typical RESEA appointment. These activities consist of a requirement to log into a website, complete a resume checklist, and participate in two additional activities of their choice prior to their assigned RESEA meeting. The control group will be asked to participate in the program per the status quo. This randomized control trial will be used to determine whether the quality of the RESEA appointment can be improved, as measured by employment and earnings outcomes, with supplemental activities outside of the one-on-one appointment typically offered by the program."
