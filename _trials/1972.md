abstract: "Background: Among substance abusing population stigma and negative emotions are highly prevalent which can negatively hinder recovery and accelerate relapse. Aim: This study aimed to examine the effect of expressive writing intervention for improving self-stigma and depression/anxiety symptoms among drug dependent inpatients in a governmental hospital, in Alexandria. Methods: Participants (N= 165) were assigned to a 5- sessions 15 minutes expressive writing intervention or control group. Self-stigma (SSAD) and depression/anxiety (DASS-21) were measured at baseline and immediately after the intervention (posttreatment). Results: The present controlled trial found a favorable effect of EDW on the SSAD applying stigma score among drug use inpatients in the crude analysis. However the effect was unclear after adjusting for the baseline score. No group differences were found at posttreatment for other SSAD subscales neither for depression/anxiety scores. Conclusion: It is not fully clear from the study that an EDW program is effective in improving self-stigma and depression/anxiety among inpatients with drug abuse/dependence. Further research using a larger sample within a randomized and blinded context is needed. "
