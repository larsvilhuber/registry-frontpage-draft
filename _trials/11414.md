abstract: "Previous research in Ghana, India, and Kenya has demonstrated the effectiveness of an innovative strategy to increase student learning—differentiated learning that teaches students at their level of knowledge, not their grade level, for some period of the school day. Despite its successes, this method of teaching is not always implemented with great fidelity in all settings, raising concerns as governments move to scale this intervention. This study tests the effect of different trainings aimed at improving the implementation rates of differentiated learning on teaching practices and student achievement in primary school. In particular, we evaluate whether in-person training compared to digital training can improve upon the status quo in terms of both effectiveness and cost effectiveness. The resulting RCT has three arms randomized at the school level—a control arm, one with training teachers in-person on differentiated learning, and one with a digital training on differentiated learning. We will assess the effectiveness of these trainings on improving knowledge and adoption of differentiated learning, teaching practices, and student achievement via student, teacher, and head teacher surveys and classroom observations."
