abstract: "Individuals specializing in what they can do best is a central component of economic production. However, people often seek partners among those who are superficially like them (e.g., gender, race). Such preferences for homophily can deprive a population of diversity, resulting in segregation. In a market context, such preferences can harm efficiency by limiting the search for exchange partners. We are interested to study mechanisms that drive lack of diversity in a setting where agents can engage in the most foundational market behavior: they can specialize to generate gains from trade through exchange.
