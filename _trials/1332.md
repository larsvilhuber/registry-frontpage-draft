abstract: "This randomized field experiment examines the effects of good governance on tax compliance. To examine the effects of good governance, we randomly allocate taxpayers to regimes with different efficiencies of tax administration. Our design implements three treatments with: (i) a 30% decrease in administrative costs, (ii) a reimbursement of 30% of administrative costs through a third party (iii) a full reimbursement of administrative costs through a third party, and, (iv) no changes in administrative costs. Besides the evaluation of average effects of these treatments on the tax gap and tax payments, we study the heterogeneity of treatment effects by interacting treatments with information on tax payments prior to the experiment."
