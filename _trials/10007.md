abstract: "Economists have advanced several psychological frictions to explain why many 401(k)-eligible employees undersave for retirement despite generous matching incentives. We provide evidence on four of these frictions through a high-compliance field experiment randomizing undersaving employees to information- and incentive-based treatments linked to a survey assessing each friction’s baseline incidence. We report four findings: (1) We corroborate evidence of pervasive deficits in retirement literacy and their correlation with saving but precisely reject any meaningful increase in saving from personalized recommendations that demonstrably improve literacy. (2) In (unplanned) analyses of plan confusion, we estimate that 20 to 37 percent of non-participants mistakenly believed themselves to be enrolled—these employees enrolled at high rates when prompted to review their plan status. (3) We find no evidence that enrollment complexity impedes saving—few employees perceived enrollment as prohibitively time-consuming and simplifying enrollment further did not increase saving. (4) We directly implicate present focus as a cause of undersaving by showing a significant share of employees increased saving in response to a small but immediate $10 gift card but not to clarification of the dramatically larger, but delayed, plan match. A survey of policy/industry stakeholders suggests these findings challenge perceived plan engagement best-practices. Finally, calibrations indicate a beta-delta model of present bias cannot account for the observed behavior and beliefs of employees. We propose an alternative model of anxiety-based present focus and deferred optimism that does explain our findings—and possibly other retirement savings puzzles—and offers a psychological rationale for the use of microincentives to increase engagement and for more structural reforms seeking to link traditional saving accounts to more liquid accounts designed to relieve near-term anxiety."
