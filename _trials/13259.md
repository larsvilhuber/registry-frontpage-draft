abstract: "This study aims to evaluate the effects of the 'Jovem de Futuro' program on high school students' academic proficiency and progression within the state schools of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Unlike previous assessments which focused solely on immediate student outcomes, this study broadens its scope to examine the program's impact on management attitudes, leadership styles, and pedagogical practices within schools. The study leverages the randomized allocation of program start dates to assess the program's impact. This design compares outcomes between schools in regions where the program commences in 2024 to those in regions where implementation is deferred until 2027. By extending the analysis beyond student performance metrics to effects on school management and pedagogical practices, the study seeks to provide a clearer understanding of the role of school management in influencing student outcomes and addressing educational inequalities."
