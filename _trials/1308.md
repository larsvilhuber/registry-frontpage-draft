abstract: "Entrepreneurs stay in business despite both lower initial earnings and slower growth of income than in paid employment (Hamilton et al., 2000; Moskowitz and Vissing-Jorgensen, 2002; Astebro et al., 2004). This puzzling behavior is commonly explained by nonpecuniary taste-based factors like preferences for autonomy or control  (see for review Astebro et al., 2014). Though specific preferences, of course, play a role, the entrepreneurs can stay self-employed simply because they can not find a job since prospective employers could prefer candidates with corporate experience.

Some studies show discrimination of entrepreneurs at the labor market ( e.g. Failla et al., 2017). However, these evidence either correlation or inconclusive. Moreover, little is known why employees discriminate the entrepreneurs: is it taste-based discrimination (Becker, 1971) or statistical one  (Phelps, 1972; Arrow, 1973)?  We provide correspondence experiment (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2004) in Russia to fill this gap Specifically, we try to understand (1) if entrepreneurial discrimination exists;  (2) if it exists, is it statistical or taste based; (3) if providing a goal for applying can reduce the level of discrimination. In addition, we measure the level of ethnic discrimination. 

We send  12.000 fictitious resumes in response to 3000 real job advertisement in Russia and measure the rate of call-backs as an indicator of interest in the applicant.  To elicit discrimination towards entrepreneurs we send identical CV's, except that we randomly assign if a person was self-employed or worked for a company.  To assess if the entrepreneurial discrimination is statistically based, we apply for the occupations with different skill-levels:  High or low skill level job according to International Standard Classification of Occupations (2008).
We assess racial discrimination randomly assigning the Slavic and ethnic minorities sounding names to the resumes with equal quality  e.g. Alexey Lebedev vs. Ansar Juraev. "
