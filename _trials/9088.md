abstract: "In a laboratory experiment with 240 participants, we aim to analyze the impact of cognitive load on bidding behavior in a second price sealed-bid auction. Deviations from rational behavior and consistent overbidding are often observed in second-price auctions. Cognitive load impacts bidding causing larger deviations from the rational behavior. We here aim to investigate whether the impact of cognitive load mainly impacts the understanding of the auction mechanism during the training phase, or it impacts value formation when bidding."
