abstract: "As an effort to promote access to healthcare services and products, people usually face an out-of-pocket price that is lower than the true marginal cost, which leads to overuse. Traditional approach to this problem would be to increase price, but in healthcare setting it is in conflict with the first order importance of access. In this project we study whether non-monetary approaches - text message nudges on rational healthcare utilization could make a difference. Since the overuse is neither individually nor socially efficient, we will test whether people respond to self and social aspect nudges.
