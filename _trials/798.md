abstract: "Increasing transparency and accountability in the heath sector is thought to improve health service delivery outcomes; however, there is little empirical evidence on the ways in which this might occur in a developing country setting.  In Uganda, UNICEF in partnership with the Ministry of Health of Uganda has developed facility-level performance indicator reports (PIRs) that are based on administrative data and can be distributed to health facilities via mTrac - an innovative mobile phone platform that is operating nationally at scale.  The PIRs provide health facilities with detailed information on their performance on four key reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health indicators relative to other facilities and relative to their past performance.  Using a randomized control experimental design and targeting approximately 1400 facilities, this project aims to test the impact of increased transparency through the sharing of performance indicator reports with front line health workers on facility-level performance after 12 months.  Simultaneously, we plan to evaluate the impact of also sharing similar performance reports with district health officials in a random sample of about half of 95 districts in the country.  The goal is to shed light on the ways in which strengthening accountability chains in Uganda might help improve health system performance."
