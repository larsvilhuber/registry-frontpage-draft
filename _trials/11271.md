abstract: "In a sample of 1,000 small business-owners in Addis Ababa, we promote a national business plan competition. Business owners are randomly assigned to be informed that the competition prioritizes and has a reserved prize for women. We estimate whether information on female prioritzation and a female-only prize increases female business owner's willingness to participate in the competition. "
