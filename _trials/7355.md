abstract: "An individual’s social preferences are influenced by a variety of factors. In this experiment we examine the extent to which perceptions of luck and effort shape social preferences. In particular, we examine the extent to which a high-income shapes social attitudes towards others – especially regarding (re)allocation decisions in the rest of society."
