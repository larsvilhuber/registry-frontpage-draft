abstract: "With the rise of the sharing economy, more and more drivers have joined online car-hailing platforms. On the one hand, this has brought new benefits to the platform. On the other hand, risky driving habits also bring a lot of safety hazards to platforms and society. Therefore, how to nudge drivers to develop good driving habits has become an urgent problem.
In this study, we plan to conduct a large-scale field experiment in China. We will select drivers with similar historical performance on an online car-hailing platform and randomly assign them to a course learning group, a voice broadcast group, a positive framing group, a negative framing group, a money incentive group, an honorary incentive group, team competition groups, and control groups. In the one-month experiment, by obtaining the GPS positioning information of the driver's mobile phone, we would take the zebra crossing overspeed ratio as the main indicator of the driver's driving behavior, and continue to observe the driver's driving behavior for another two weeks after the end of the experiment. 
After the experiment, we expect to get the following results: (1) Compared with the control group, the zebra crossing overspeed ratio of the intervention group is lower; (2) Compared with the course learning group, the zebra crossing overspeed ratio of voice broadcast group is lower; (3) Compared with individual drivers participating in the safe driving competition, the zebra crossing overspeed ratio of drivers in teams is lower; (4) Compared with the positive framing group, the zebra crossing overspeed ratio of the negative framing group is lower; (5) Compared with the honorary incentive group, the zebra crossing overspeed ratio of the money incentive group is lower.
