abstract: "Vocational training programs and, more generally, interventions that target individuals with the goal of improving their income-generating potential, face several conceptual and practical challenges. Among them is recruiting beneficiaries who both meet the need-based qualifications for these programs and possess the attributes necessary to benefit from the program. In this experiment, we propose to address two research questions aimed at understanding how referrals can improve recruiting to vocational training and similar programs. First, can incentivized referral programs increase the size and quality of the applicant pool for such programs? Second, is the gender composition of referrals related to referees' beliefs about gender differences in suitability for the program in question? To answer these questions, we will combine a structured online lab experiment to elicit gender-specific beliefs about suitability for an IT support job training program with an incentivized referral activity. The referral activity pays referees conditional on their referrals undertaking the relatively time-intensive application process. It is designed to elicit the gender composition of referees' top two referrals, as well as whether referees are able and willing to provide a gender-balanced portfolio of referrals when incentivized to do so."
