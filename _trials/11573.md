abstract: "The objective of this study is to evaluate an innovative intervention and three conventional experiments aimed at reducing the prejudicial attitudes and enhancing the attitudes of compassion, trust, and collaboration amongst two major ethnic groups (Tamils and Sinhalese) in Sri Lanka. More distinctively, we intend to carry out a randomized experiment in Sri Lanka to evaluate the effectiveness of screenings of two documentary movies that enhance the awareness of both ethnic groups about the livelihoods, culture, and hardships of each other. We attempt to understand how exposure to this edutainment activity affects the attitudes and behavior of each ethnic group towards the fellow ethnic group. More specifically, we aim to determine, using this program, whether access to information can enhance compassion, trust, and collaboration between two ethnic groups while decreasing prejudicial attitudes. We will measure the expected outcomes using survey questions and lab-in-the-field experiments. "
