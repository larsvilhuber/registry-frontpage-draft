abstract: "Distribution and ownership of land remain highly skewed towards men across the world. While there is an increasing focus in the policy sphere on bridging this gap, our understanding of how strengthening property rights impact women’s well-being is limited. This project runs a randomized experiment to study the impact of improving residential property rights for women on their welfare. In collaboration with the local government, the project will conduct an awareness campaign in rural villages in Pune, India, creating exogenous variation in the strength of realized women’s property rights. We will then study the effect of these improved rights on female empowerment through measures such as intra-household bargaining power, the incidence of domestic violence and land security."
