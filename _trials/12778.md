abstract: "There is a dire need for expanding employment opportunities for populations in low-income settings, who exhibit low rates of labor force participation and high levels of precarious, informal work. Leveraging the spread of technology, digital labor platforms have the potential to improve labor market outcomes by embedding skilling, addressing information asymmetries, and enabling more efficient matching of workers and jobs at scale, while significantly reducing job search costs. Given gendered barriers to work participation – such as women’s domestic burden and lower mobility – the flexible nature and location of platform work holds the promise of benefiting women, in particular. We design a cluster-randomized intervention in India’s capital Delhi to ease search and employment frictions by offering young men and women information on the potential of job matching platforms, including up-skilling, along with assistance with digital job search. We study the impact of the intervention on the job search behavior, skilling, employment, and any gender differences therein.
