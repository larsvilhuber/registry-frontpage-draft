abstract: "Decisions with outcomes realizing in the future inherently contain ambiguity. This suggest a natural link between ambiguity and intertemporal behavior. Based on this, I investigate whether ambiguity attitudes shape intertemporal decision-making using a laboratory experiment. A key feature of my design is that I jointly elicit ambiguity attitudes as well as discounting behavior over a consumption good. Importantly, I exogenously vary the timing of receiving the good and, independently, the ambiguity over the utility of consuming the good. This allows me to quantify the change in ambiguity over time and causally measure its impact on discounting behavior. "
