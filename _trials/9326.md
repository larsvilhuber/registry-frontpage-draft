abstract: "We conduct an RCT testing how a credit card nudge -- shrouding the Autopay option to automatically pay only the minimum due and increasing the salience of an alternative Autopay option to automatically amortize debt faster -- affects cardholders. Despite the nudge causing large (21 percentage points) proximate effects changing Autopay enrollment, it has no distal effects on debt. This is explained by offsetting consumer responses including choosing `low' Autopay amounts that bind at or near the minimum and lower Autopay enrollment which increases missed payments."
