abstract: "In collaboration with the Government of Sierra Leone, we are scaling social signaling incentives, specifically colored bracelets, across 20% of the country’s public clinics. We are evaluating their impact on routine immunization uptake, including the new malaria vaccine, under two different designs that vary the number of vaccination points at which parents receive a signal. In both treatments, we replicate the design tested in Karing (2024), where children receive an initial bracelet at the first vaccine visit and a signal at nine months. To test the potential for signaling incentives to reduce the drop-off in later vaccines, we also add a signal at the final malaria vaccine visit at 18 months. The two treatments differ in whether a bracelet is also provided at the first malaria dose. A signal at more frequent decision points might offer less of an opportunity to stand out as a good parent, potentially reducing the bracelet’s signaling effect. Conversely, frequent signals could offset unexpected costs, acting as insurance. Beyond social image concerns, making the new vaccine visible may impact vaccination uptake by accelerating learning about its availability, safety, and schedule. We will shed light on the role of the social signaling and information channels through surveys with caregivers across control and treatment clinics.
