abstract: "We conduct a virtual lab experiment to understand individuals' vaccine sharing attitudes and behaviour in the context of altruistic and self-interested narratives, with and without peer effects. A 2-by-3 factorial design is used to determine the isolated impact as well as the interaction of these treatments on vaccine sharing with resource-poor countries, which is approximated by monetary donations from subject payments to the vaccine access initiative COVAX. The main interventions are complemented by detailed socio-economic surveys, including attitudes towards vaccines and vaccine history."
