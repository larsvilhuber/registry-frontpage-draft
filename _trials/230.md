abstract: "The United States federal income tax code provides tax benefits for low-income households. Nonetheless, many low-income households do not file taxes and are not able to receive benefits that they are eligible for. In this project, we test the hypothesis that providing information on the benefits from filing a tax return can increase tax filing amongst low-income households. The research is based on a mailing experiment conducted in collaboration with the Internal Revenue Service. In the experiment, nonfilers who did not file taxes in Tax Year 2011 will be identified, and some nonfilers will be randomly selected to receive information on the benefits of filing tax returns. The analysis will examine how information on the tax code affects filing amended returns for Tax Years 2011 and 2012 and filing new returns for Tax Year 2013. This RCT will be implemented in the Fall of 2013, with outcome data becoming available by late Fall of 2014.  "
