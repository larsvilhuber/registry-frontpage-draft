abstract: "This project addresses the pervasive lack of diversity in the field of economics, which hinders the development of inclusive policies and perpetuates outdated teaching practices. Despite advancements in diversity within other STEM disciplines, economics struggles to attract and retain a diverse student body, resulting in antiquated methods and a faculty composition that lags behind other academic fields. This research initiative proposes a scalable intervention focused on enhancing gender and racial diversity in economics by developing a series of videos and accompanying curricular materials. These resources aim to introduce diverse role models, relevant research, and active learning strategies into undergraduate economics classrooms. Targeting principles of economics courses, the project seeks to broaden perceptions of economists and their studies, foster a sense of belonging among students, and increase the likelihood of retention for women and historically excluded groups in the economics profession. The intervention comprises "plug and play" modules, featuring professionally produced videos and evidence-based curricular materials, designed to expose students to exciting and relevant topics in diverse economists' research. The hypothesis is that these modules will positively influence perceptions about economics, enhance students' sense of belonging and self-efficacy, and improve learning outcomes, persistence, and retention among diverse students in economics. This project contributes to the literature on diversity in education by addressing gaps in existing mentoring and profession-climate improvement programs, targeting an earlier stage in the educational pipeline, and providing instructors with easily implementable tools for interactive teaching in economics."
