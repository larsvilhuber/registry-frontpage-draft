abstract: "Previous results from unincentivized surveys suggest that consumers value Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and that CSR activities, such as socially and environmentally sustainable production of goods, increase customers’ purchase intention and their stated willingness to pay for products. However, real markets show that the share of sustainable products is still very small – particularly in the textile market. One reason for this discrepancy might be that customers show appreciation for CSR activities in surveys and hypothetical decision situations, but that in real markets, when it comes to their own money, they are not willing to pay a price premium for sustainably produced products. Evidence from field experiments shows mixed results. We conduct a randomized experiment to test whether consumers’ willingness to accept, elicited in an incentivized auction (BDM), increases when they are informed that a product is sustainably produced.
