abstract: "This project aims to provide experimental evidence on the impact of a study-skills course on student academic performance. We make a call to all first-year students of a private university in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to participate in a 6-hour course (2 hours in 3 days, weekly). Half of the students are randomly assigned to treatment (to receive the course during March 2021), and half of the students to control. We will compare the academic performance of treated and control students."
