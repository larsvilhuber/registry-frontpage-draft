abstract: "Recent research indicates that prevalence rates of sexual assault on college campuses are on the rise, ranging from as a high as 13% - 30% (Cantor et al., 2015). Research has revealed that individuals frequently report that they communicate sexual consent by not resisting their partners sexual advances (Humphrey's & Muehlenhard, 1999) and prefer to assume consent rather than ask for it (Humphreys, 2007). Within an Irish context, previous reports indicate that college students believe that consent often represents a 'grey area' and that further consideration of the topic is warranted (MacNeela et al., 2014). This study draws on the findings from previous research and assesses whether a sexual consent workshop can promote more positive sexual consent attitudes and behavioural intentions among college students, in comparison to a control condition. 
Approximately 400 students will be recruited from universities and colleges across Ireland. Consenting students from participating institutions are randomly allocated to either a two-hour sexual consent or a two-hour sexual health workshop. Attitudes toward consent and behavioural intentions to engage in consent behaviours are assessed in both groups at baseline (before students participate in the workshops). Participants' attitudes toward consent and behavioural intentions will also be assessed at a post-test evaluation, immediately after having completed the workshop, and again at a three-month follow-up, via an online questionnaire. Each workshop is delivered by a trained facilitator and a co-facilitator will assess the fidelity of each workshop. Following completion of the quantitative assessments, a sub-sample of participants from multiple institutions will be invited to take part in a focus group discussion. These focus groups will be carried out as part of a process evaluation in order to understand the mechanisms through which the workshops exerted their effects (if any) on students' attitudes and behavioural intentions and explore any unexpected outcomes.
