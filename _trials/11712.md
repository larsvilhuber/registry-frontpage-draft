abstract: "This study intends to measure how people respond to a future pandemic, depending on the characteristics of the pandemic (overall mortality risk and group at highest mortality risk -- children or elderly). Our participants get randomized into one of four versions of the pandemic. We measure people's intent to self-protect as well as their support for policies intended to control the spread of the pandemic. Further, we measure people's beliefs about the behavior and policy support of others, in order to capture beliefs about social norms. "
