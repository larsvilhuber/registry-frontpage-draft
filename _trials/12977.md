abstract: "Intelligent machines, artificial intelligence (AI), and algorithms are reshaping our society in domains like hospitality, healthcare, and space exploration. As AI progresses, understanding human trust in AI and how it differs from scientific trust more generally, as well as the mechanisms shaping (mis)trust, is crucial for preserving the quality of the social fabric in a free society. 

Using a survey experiment as part of a nationally-representative panel study in the United States, this project compares how news of AI progress in linguistics, medicine, and dating, versus scientific advancements in the same domains, impact trust across diverse societal groups. For example, an AI breakthrough in linguistics might be perceived differently than a non-AI scientific discovery in the same domain. The study investigates if AI progress causes more fear or excitement compared to traditional scientific progress and how these emotions influence trust. It unveils the factors shaping (mis)trust, including the innovation’s potential, fear, and perceptions of societal benefits. This project will contribute to the principles of AI design that respect and enhance the freedoms of society by providing data-driven insights into the public's trust in AI. These insights can help shape AI systems that are aligned with the ideals of autonomy, transparency, ethics, inclusivity, responsiveness, and balanced innovation—fundamental to a society that values freedom.
