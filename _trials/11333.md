abstract: "While a growing body of programs have shown promise to increase use of contraception among first time mothers (FTMs), difficulties remain in scaling beyond small pilot areas and institutionalizing within existing systems. Connect’s approach aims to strengthen existing government health systems and community-level health efforts, including those supported through local and international non-governmental organizations, by developing and testing light-touch “enhancements” with the goal of increasing postpartum Family Planning (PPFP) adoption among FTMs. We will evaluate Connect's approach through a cluster randomized control trial.
