abstract: "A growing education literature suggests that supporting parents through text messages (SMS) can positively impact students’ behavior and educational attainment.  While those studies highlight the potential of text messages for producing cost-effective educational results, there is limited evidence on the optimal design of SMS campaigns.  What it the optimal frequency of texting, so as to most effectively capture parents’ attention without saturating it? At what time should messages be sent? Should parents get messages always at the same time? Is interactive content more effective? The answers to those questions are critical as governments and international organizations consider scaling up successful SMS interventions. This paper cross-randomizes different features of the design of a typical SMS campaign targeted at making parenting a habit among families of public schools’ 9th graders in Brazil. Those experiments assess the impacts of alternative campaign parameters: (i) frequency , (ii) time of the day, (iii) consistency of time of delivery, and (iv) interactivity, on student’s attendance, grades, and drop-out rates.
