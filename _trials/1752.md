abstract: "We will recruit survey participants on MTurk to conduct an online survey. With this survey, we plan to study 1) whether participants under-report xenophobic sentiments due to their social undesirability, and 2) whether the social undesirability is reduced by knowing that a large proportion of the population supports a presidential candidate with xenophobic views.
First, all subject will answer a few demographic questions. Second, they will be randomized into two groups. Subjects in the control group will receive no information. Subjects in the treatment group will be told what is the probability of a presidential candidate with xenophobic views to win the next election: our hypothesis is that knowing that the presidential candidate has large support, will lead subjects to revise their belief about the social undesirability of expressing xenophobic sentiments. We will collect evidence about this by asking subjects in both groups how many people they think hold xenophobic sentiments in their state. Third, to test our two hypotheses, we will measure subjects willingness to donate money to an immigration-reduction organization. Participants will be randomized into two groups: in one group we will emphasize that their decision is private; in the other group we will tell subjects that "a member of the research team might personally contact you to verify your answers", thus making the decision to be perceived as public. We will test our hypothesis by comparing the donation decisions of subjects in the four (2x2) experimental groups.

In a follow-up experiment to test the same hypotheses, we recruit participants living in the Pittsburgh area through an online panel survey firm. The design of this second experiment is similar to the first one. Participants are also asked to make a donation to an anti-immigration organization and to report how many people they think hold xenophobic views, and are randomized into four different treatments along two dimensions. First, subjects are either informed about the fact that “In the 2016 US Presidential Election, Donald Trump won Pittsburgh’s metropolitan area” or about the fact that “In the 2016 US Presidential Election, Hillary Clinton won Pittsburgh’s county.” Second, subjects are randomized either in a private or in public condition. In this case, however, we randomized the visibility of the donation with respect to participants’ potential peers and not with respect to the surveyor: one half of the participants were offered anonymity, while the other half expected their donation decision to appear on a website to be shared with all the other participants from their area."
