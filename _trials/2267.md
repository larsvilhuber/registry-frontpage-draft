abstract: "The efficient tax and fees collection by the public authorities is crucial for their proper functioning as it usually constitutes the main source of their revenues. Similarly, the Czech Television (CT) faces a worrying situation when the TV license fee collection gradually decreases while it forms over 90% of its revenues. In cooperation with the CT, we run a large scale field experiment in order to increase the efficiency of the collections and to test several motivations for the non-response and non-compliance of the liable households. We mail letters to the households that have been identified to potentially evade the fees. We (i) simplify the structure of the letters, (ii) vary their informational content to separately address five distinct motives of non-compliance, and (iii) in an orthogonal design to that we vary the levels of attention the envelopes raise. The households are randomly allocated to treatments, stratifying on a regional level and on two age groups. The main outcomes are (i) the response rate and (ii) the registration rate."
