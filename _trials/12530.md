abstract: "Gender gaps are still pervasive in many economic domains. When confronted with information on these gender gaps, or with individual pieces of information such as typical outcomes for men and women, people may adjust their behavior, especially if this information differs from their initial beliefs. That is, individuals may exhibit social learning in the face of information provision. In this project, we aim to investigate how social learning within and across genders affects gender gaps in Ghanaâ€™s microcredit market."
