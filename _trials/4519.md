abstract: "Despite mounting public concern over the issue of social media overusage, there is limited evidence that the time individuals spend on social media platforms is excessive from a welfare standpoint. I implement a randomised intervention over 6 weeks, encouraging a subset of 629 participants recruited over Facebook to adopt a voluntary soft commitment device designed to help limit their phone, Facebook, and Instagram usage. Utilising data from 4 surveys and direct measurement of social media use, I find that: (i) individuals persistently underestimate how much time they actually spend on social media; (ii) they spend much more time on their phones and Facebook than they profess to ideally desire; (iii) users are willing to set application limits even in the absence of incentives to do so; (iv) and lastly, the adoption of such limits significantly reduces phone and Facebook use, with reductions in the latter persisting even after a month. These results all suggest that individuals spend more time on social media than is optimal as a result of their limited ability to exercise self-control.
Additionally, in a second experimental arm of the study, I investigate the effect of nudging individuals to review and report their Facebook privacy settings on their behaviour, finding that it results in limited changes to privacy-protective choices; instead, I find that individuals respond by reducing their usage of Facebook.
