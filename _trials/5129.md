abstract: "Many economic and social interactions involve trust and reciprocation (e.g. employer-employee, buyer-seller, borrower-lender). It is well-known that at least some people are trustworthy: they are willing to reciprocate if their partner trusts them, even when reciprocation comes at a substantial monetary cost. Not much is known, however, about the effect of the cost of trusting for the partner's reciprocation: are people more inclined to reciprocate trust, the higher the amount that the partner leaves on the table by trusting, that is, the ‘better’ is the outside option? We study this question by designing laboratory experiments in which participants play trust games that vary in terms of the outside option. The answer to this question helps to understand trust relations.
