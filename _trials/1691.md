abstract: "Will learning that someone else receives a higher pay for the same work have an effect on one's effort? Does the magnitude of this effect depend on one's fairness perceptions? To address these two questions, we will run a field experiment in which different participants will do the same data entry work for different pay rates - high and low. There will be three conditions. In the first, the participants will receive the high rate and will not know that others receive the low rate. In the second, the participants will receive the low rate without knowing of the high rate. In the third condition, the participants will receive the low rate but will learn of others receiving the high rate in a controlled way. We will measure the participants' fairness perceptions before they start working, and survey them some time after the end of the experiment, to learn more about their reactions to pay rate differences and their beliefs as to the reasons behind them. The findings from our experiment will be of interest to the literature on the effects of social comparisons. "
