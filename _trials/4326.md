abstract: "Many developing countries rely on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to generate employment and growth, in part expecting spillovers from these highly productive foreign firms. One of the mechanisms through with  spillovers can arise is the transmission of knowledge from foreign managers to domestic employees inside the firm. 
We design two experiments to show the existence of these knowledge transfers and identify the importance of one of the main barriers that could prevent the transmission of human capital inside the firm: language frictions. The two experiments take place in Myanmar. The first experiment consists in asking Human Resources managers from domestic firms to rate a series of hypothetical resumes from candidates they could consider hiring. Through this experiment, we plan to measure the labor market returns of experience at a FDI firm and how that premium varies with the intensity of communication between local employees and foreign managers. The second experiment consists in providing foreign language training to current employees of FDI firms to test whether learning the language of the foreign managers fosters communication and knowledge transfers.
