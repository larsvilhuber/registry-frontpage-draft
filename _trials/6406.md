abstract: "We employ an online randomized lab experiment to estimate the impact of a company's bankruptcy status on consumer demand for that company's products. We identify each participant's willingness to pay for a product of a bankrupt firm. We measure how that willingness to pay changes when we exogenously introduce information about the bankrupt firm."
