abstract: "The world is now heavily dependent on technology, and it has become necessary for SMEs in Africa to embrace it too. However, the majority of SMEs in Africa face barriers in adopting digital technology, from little access to technology to other external environmental and internal managerial factors. A significant number of SMEs in Africa require technical assistance, but do not yet have the financing to pay consultants out of pocket.  We conduct a field experiment in Ghana building on the digital technology and commitment literature by designing and evaluating a digital literacy training treatment arm, as well as a commitment to innovate arm. We study the effects of these interventions on technology adoption, changes in business practices and firm performance in the form of productivity, sales, profits and employment. We also examine potential important mechanisms underlying gender inequality in technology adoption and entrepreneurial growth. "
