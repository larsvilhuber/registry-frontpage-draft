abstract: "This study separately collects and analysis the data from the Workers in the who are matched to the Spectators in the Study "Why Meritocrat? The Role of Pure Fairness Preferences" (AEARCTR-0008495). Workers are asked questions to categorize them as having meritocratic elements in their fairness preferences, or not. Thereafter they conduct a task under different information structures (knowing, or not knowing, about the payment structure in advance of conducting the task), and under different payment schemes (relevant if they know about the payment structure in advance). At the end of the experiment they are asked to guess according to what payment scheme payment was actually determined (relevant if they were not informed). "
