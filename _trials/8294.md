abstract: "We present an experimental design to investigate the effects of gender identity and group size on group contests. Both in the control and the experimental treatment, groups consisting of only females and males will engage in symmetric group contests (3vs3). In the experimental treatment, the gender compositions will be revealed and players will be primed by filling a gender identity survey and male-female emojis representing players.  Furthermore, we will also run the same experiment in an asymmetric group contest (3vs5) setting to examine the relationship between group size and identity. Before and after the group contest, we take individual incentivized social value orientation measures to examine the degree of in-group bias created by the group contest.
