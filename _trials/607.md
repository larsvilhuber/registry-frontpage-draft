abstract: "This paper studies the consumption, debt and balance sheet response to increased savings. The budget constraint requires that every dollar saved should decrease consumption (or increase debt). Do individuals cut on groceries or human capital investments in response to increased savings? Do minimum savings requirements such as IRAs decrease liquidity and induce expensive borrowing through credit cards? We revisit such foundational questions on the consumption/savings interplay in the retirement savings context, and propose a research design that would allow to answer these questions directly via a field experiment in a European financial institution. Through a large local financial institution, we randomly exclude a few thousand individuals from a phone solicitation to increase their savings through a retirement savings account, and track their consumption, debt and balance sheet responses.
