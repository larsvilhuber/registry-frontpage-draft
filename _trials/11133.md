abstract: "The industrial and commercial sectors consumed 71.6% of Mexico's total electricity, mostly from fossil fuels (73% of the electricity comes from this source). The current national and international context presents an opportunity for energy efficiency investments to reduce emissions in these sectors while reducing energy costs to firms. However, little is known about businesses' challenges and barriers to adopting energy-saving upgrades. This project aims to conduct a randomized controlled trial with micro and small-sized Mexican firms to determine the effects of providing energy-efficiency information on energy conservation and consumption. Results from the study will contribute to our understanding of the issue and help in formulating more effective policies to promote the adoption of energy-efficient technologies and better energy conservation practices in Mexico and other developing countries."
