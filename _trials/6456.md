abstract: "The most vulnerable and marginalized citizens - though eligible - are often excluded from safety net programs, even when schemes are self-targeted. The project considers India's workfare guarantee, MGNREGA, which is designed to provide guaranteed work to citizens who request, or "demand" work. Our study directly elicits demand from vulnerable populations, then provides local leaders and program administrators with aggregate information about local work demand. We randomize information provision at two levels to understand complementarities in information sharing across government tiers. We also randomize which communities' work demand is made most salient to higher-level officials, to understand the extent to which there are spillovers or crowding out in service provision. Our study will also explore the role of implementersâ€™ beliefs about work demand in affecting safety-net access, and assess how closing perception gaps related to interest in working affect our outcomes of interest.
