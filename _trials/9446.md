abstract: "Gender differences in competitiveness have been studied extensively in experimental economics, and are often put forth as an important contributor to the gender-wage gap. Recent work in psychology uses virtual reality (VR) to embody individuals in bodies with different characteristics, including sex, and reports corresponding changes in the perception of the self. Specifically, embodiment in the body of the opposite sex has recently been shown to lead participants to identify more with the opposite sex and to increase self-attribution of traits stereotypically associated with the opposite sex, including competitiveness (Tacikowski et al., 2020). Evidence on whether these self-reported results on attitudes extend to behavior is lacking. The objective of this project is to test the impact of such gender identity manipulations on selection into competitive environments in the lab."
