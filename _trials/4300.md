abstract: "This project explores the existence of a Laffer curve related with the personal income tax, from a behavioral economics approach. For this purpose, we designed an economic experiment testing the effects of different tax rates on the level of effort that subjects decide to exert.  This study aims to contribute to the debate generated between traditional neoclassical economics and theories based on the behavior of economic agents. The approach from behavioral economics is of special interest, given the limitations and excessive simplicity that arise when estimating the Laffer curve through other sources. On the contrary, experimental methods allow to introduce factors and generate precise data about individual decisions. The results will help determine the existence or absence of a behavioral Laffer curve."
