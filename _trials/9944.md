abstract: "At least 2 billion people around the world drink water from a contaminated source.  About two million children die every year from diarrheal diseases and around 700 million people worldwide are affected by chronic kidney disease because of unsafe drinking water and sanitation, despite the availability of effective and inexpensive technologies to improve water quality (Null et al. 2012).  Most efforts to provide clean water focused on the technology of chlorine (adding chlorine or chlorine compounds such as sodium hypochlorite to water), which is affordable and easy to use (see, for example, Amrita, Kremer, and Zwane 2010; Null et al. 2012; Dupas et al. 2022).
Despite the evidence of health benefits associated with chlorinated water, empirical evidence indicates that most households in developing countries are not willing to adopt and pay much for it (Amrita, Kremer, and Zwane 2010; Null et al. 2012; Berry, Fischer, and Guiteras 2020). Indeed, Dupas et al. (2016) and Dupas et al. (2022) report that less than half of households consume chlorinated water even when they receive chlorine for free.

A plausible hypothesis is that previous efforts to promote adoption of clean water disregard the importance of understanding the local culture, namely local taste and tradition. Our hypothesis is that dislike for taste of chlorinated water and/or its cultural unsuitability might explain the low take-up rates (and willingness to pay) of chlorinated water, other than price itself or lack of adequate information. Moreover, in rural areas with high illiteracy rates, people may use taste as a strong signal of healthy water more than standard information messages. 

Specifically, we provide experimental evidence that local taste and traditions are important –yet overlooked so far– dimensions in the decision of adopting clean water. We introduce a new culturally-friendly technology that produces clean water taking into account local culture and preferences, by filtering local water in water treatment units. Differently from chlorination, this technology does not alter the taste of water, nor the taste of traditional beverages that are a relevant part of locals’ consumption habits and sociality. Moreover, in rural areas with high illiteracy rates, people may use taste as a strong signal of healthy water. 

We study this question in rural Egypt, where groundwater sources exhibit increasing levels of contamination and salinity due to seawater intrusion and soil degradation (Said et al., 2021). We perform several experiments using samples of filtered and chlorinated water. While the two types of water are healthier than status-quo water, they differ in taste, since filtered water is closer to the taste individuals expect in local water and traditional beverages. The first experiment consists of a blind test where respondents test both a sample of filtered and chlorinated water, not knowing the types of water, and then indicate their preferred sample. Second, we test if filtered water leads to higher adoption rates and willingness-to-pay for clean water using the Becker et al. (1964) mechanism. Three ancillary experiments explore underlying reasons behind the preferences revealed in the previous experiments by investigating individuals' perceptions of taste, health and cultural suitability among samples of filtered, chlorinated and bottled water. Lastly, we inspect long-run health and socio-economic outcomes following adoption of treated and chlorinated water.
