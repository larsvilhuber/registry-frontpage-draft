abstract: "The study hypothesizes that individuals exposed to innovatively designed risky-investment products will invest significantly higher stakes than those exposed to simpler risky-investment products. Therefore, in this study, we explore why people are attracted to risky investments, such as investment projects consisting of multiple sub-projects. We will examine whether misjudging probability of success and being attracted to innovative risks cause people to overspend on these investment products in a series of controlled economic experiments."
