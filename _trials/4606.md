abstract: "There exists rich literature documenting the importance of framing and language in designing incentives for workers in firms. Experimental evidence has shown that framing manipulations that leverage loss aversion can increase worker productivity. Other studies have found that messaging with corporate social responsibility (CSR) also increases productivity while also increasing propensity of cheating. In this paper, we contribute to and synthesize these two strands of literature on worker incentives in a common setting, with experimental data. We intend to run a large-scale experiment that varies the framing and language of monetary incentive offers in messages prompting Lyft driver applicants to complete tasks in the application process. We will use this data to measure the effects on task completion rates, productivity, and work quality for applicants who complete their application. "
