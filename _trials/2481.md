abstract: "The Liberian Micro Small and Medium Enterprises sector experienced a significant decline in performance during the Ebola outbreak. Business closures or downsizing were very frequent over this period. Similarly, BRAC Liberia Microfinance registered a significant increase in missed repayment rates, particularly among borrowers of its Small Enterprise Program (SEP). By July 2016, 12% of SEP clients had missed at least one repayment, up from 7% in January 2014.
Understanding the impact of interventions targeting MSMEs performance is thus important from a policy perspective. Improving management skills, and in particular customer care skills - that is, the ability to communicate effectively with customers, to be polite, helpful and welcoming, thus adopting a "customer first" mentality - seems a particularly promising avenue. CRS (2016) report indicates 41% of Liberians do not feel empathy towards others. Moreover, the Ebola outbreak was characterized by a dramatic reduction and aversion towards social interactions at all levels of society (World Bank, 2015). However, interacting with customers is an important part of the daily operations of typical MSME owners in the retail or service sectors.
The study is intended to assess the feasibility of alternative approaches to business management skills training for MSME owners in the post epidemic and disaster period. The baselines will inform us about which management skills and personality traits are associated with business performance. Also, we will assess firm owners attitudes towards different types of skills training. Our aim is then to evaluate the impacts of this pilot business training intervention on firm recovery and firm growth.
