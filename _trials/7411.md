abstract: "We plan to study the labour market impacts of a training intervention developed by the NGO BRAC to help young Bangladeshis acquire skills and find employment. We will randomly vary both the offer of the training and the conditions at which the training is offered: full fee, discounted fee, or a fee payable only when trainees find work. This will enable us to estimate the impacts of the training program for the different groups of young people that are selected at the different payment conditions. In particular, we will explore whether the standard training package fails to reach a group of high-return, liquidity-constrained individuals who cannot muster the resources to optimally invest in human capital. We are also interested to understand whether the NGO can attract this group most cost-effectively by offering up-front discounts or by making fees conditional on subsequent employment."
