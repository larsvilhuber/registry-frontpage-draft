abstract: "We study the role of financial aid information in the post-secondary education decision; separating the effects of information alone and information with certainty. Our primary research question for the study asks: how does providing a minimum amount of guaranteed institutional financial aid effect the likelihood of students accepting offers of admission to a post-secondary institution.
