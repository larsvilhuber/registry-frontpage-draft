abstract: "Air quality conditions are alarmingly poor in many developing countries. Many parts of India face grave levels of air pollution with conditions ranging from unhealthy to hazardous on most days. Decreased worker productivity due to elevated concentration of particulate matter has been documented in several contexts. White-collar workers spend most of their day indoors, and air purifiers are effective at improving indoor air quality even in high pollution settings by removing around 90% of particulate matter. 

I am partnering with a call center in Haryana, India to run an impact evaluation of air purifier use. Workers at the call center sit on two floors, and the treatment is randomized at the floor-day level with one treated and one control floor each day. The study aims to address the following questions:  (1) What is the short term impact of reducing indoor particulate pollutants on worker health, cognition and productivity? (2) What is the heterogeneity in individual sensitivity to indoor pollution? "
