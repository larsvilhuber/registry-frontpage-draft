abstract: "ideas42 is working with the government of South Sudan, UNOPS (the implementer), and the World Bank to design and test scalable behavioral interventions that address some of the psychological barriers that SSSNP recipients face in optimal use of the funds they receive. The South Sudan Social Safety Net Project (SSSNP) aims to provide access to temporary income opportunities to selected poor and vulnerable households and strengthen safety net delivery tools in South Sudan. The team is testing light-touch, low-cost behavioral interventions that address the psychological barriers recipients face in order to help them optimally use their cash through an individually-randomized RCT.
