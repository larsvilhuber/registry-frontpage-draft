abstract: "Over two-thirds of Kenyans lack access to improved sanitation, a significant public health burden that costs the country nearly one percent of its GDP every year. In order to support acceleration of access to improved sanitation in Kenya, the World Bank is working directly with large plastics manufacturing firms, grassroots and local MFIs, local retailers, and the government to design, test, and support market development and distribution strategies for a range of plastic latrine slabs. 

The objective of this impact evaluation is to learn whether niche distribution and financing mechanisms are effective for reaching the base-of-the-pyramid and to evaluate health impact and cost-effectiveness of plastic latrine slabs. This study is being conducted in Busia and Nyeri counties of Kenya, where the Water and Sanitation Program of the World Bank is implementing the Selling Sanitation initiative jointly with International Finance Corporation. A key outcome of the study will be to inform future strategies of reaching households at the base of the pyramid with improved sanitation products.
