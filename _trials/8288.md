abstract: "This experiment investigates the role of magical thinking in binary dictator games. In a 2x2 treatment design, subjects are randomly allocated across two treatment dimensions: Roles and Similarity. The Roles dimension varies whether subjects are matched in traditional giver-receiver pairs (Single Role) or whether they are matched with two other participants, playing as Dictator against one and as Receiver against the other. (Dual Role). The Similarity dimension varies whether subjects are matched randomly, or matched with others who are especially similar to themselves based on a personality test. I hypothesize that there is a positive interaction effect between these two treatments on giving behavior."
