abstract: "This project estimates the risk premium individuals are willing to pay to reduce their exposure to a potentially catastrophic event: infection with a potentially lethal disease. We conduct a randomized experiment within a survey about broad economic issues, where we elicit compensating differentials for infection risk minimization during a pandemic (COVID-19) in a close physical services scenario (getting a haircut). The participants will state their additional willingness to pay (in Euro) for the service under different conditions (wearing a FFP2 mask vs. being additionally tested) and different phases (original virus vs. Omicron variant vs. new hypothetical variant). The participants are randomly selected into four treatment groups that differ in the vaccination status (vaccinated vs. unvaccinated) and conducted COVID-19 test (“Antigen” vs “Antigen + PCR”) of the person providing the close physical services for the phases “Omicron” and the new hypothetical variant. We thus obtain a quantification of the willingness to circumvent additional risk, where a broad information set about institutional trust and other socio-economic indicators allows us to identify the determinants of the compensating differential."
