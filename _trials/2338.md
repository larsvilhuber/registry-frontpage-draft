abstract: "The appropriate role of paternalistic behavior is a key issue in the political debate about the relationship between the state and its citizens. Should the state institute mandatory retirement savings, require motorcyclists to wear helmets or refuse to enforce certain types of contracts?Or should the government aim to influence choices in less intrusive ways? Questions about the legitimate role of paternalism are also at the
heart of many interpersonal relationships.

The goal of this project is to study peopleâ€™s willingness to act paternalistically and distribute income equally between two workers when the workers themselves have chosen a risky payment scheme leading to unequal payments.
