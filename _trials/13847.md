abstract: "In this RCT we implemented an online survey with a sample of owners of electric vehicles, organized in cooperation with the company that owns and manages the public charging stations in the region. Within the survey, we first illustrated the purpose of a direct load control (DLC) tariff as a measure to prevent episodes of peak electricity demand. Then, we presented the general characteristics of this type of tariff: maximum frequency of blocks, duration of each block, installation costs of the DLC remote control system, and annual electricity discount. Afterward, we gathered the yearly willingness to accept compensation to adopt a DLC tariff via a single-bounded dichotomous choice question. We randomly selected different levels of annual compensation to the participants of the experiment, and whether the remote control system required for a DLC tariff was paid by the consumer or by the company."
