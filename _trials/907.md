abstract: "Is there a psychological mechanism through which persistent fears of crime and violence weigh on productivity? We aim to study the effects of insecurity on cognition and productivity in a lab experiment in Kenya. In this study, we will experimentally induce feelings of insecurity with a reflection task, and then assess changes in performance on several tasks that require a varying mixture of cognitive skills and effort. The primary purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of our prime and to make sure our outcomes are measuring what we seek to measure. We will use this information to inform the design of a larger experiment concerning insecurity and productivity. "
