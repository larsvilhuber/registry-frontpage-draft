abstract: "We study the adoption and effects of household electrification in northern El Salvador. We generated household-level exogenous variation in connection cost by offering time-limited subsidies towards a $100 fee that had to be paid by households who wanted to connect to the grid. Vouchers increased grid connection which, in turn, increased female nonfarm employment, home business operation, and earnings. These effects persist four years after baseline. Male outcomes were largely unaffected. We feed the experimental results into an intertemporal choice model and find a parameter of present bias of 0.75, suggesting quasi-hyperbolic discounting as an additional barrier to electricity adoption."
