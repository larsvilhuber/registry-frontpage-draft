abstract: "Wage inequality can be costly to firms, yet it continues to persist. This
paper utilizes data from a field experiment to examine workers’ response
to wage inequality. The paper examines the role of the reference group
in altering equity evaluations offering a better understanding of the social
comparison process at the work place. Results show unilateral wage cuts
to reduce the quantity but not quality of work produced by the disadvantaged
workers. Unlike male workers, female workers’ response to inequality
varies with the identity of the reference group. In particular, we find
female workers’ productivity drops significantly less when subjected to an
out-group gender inequality compared to an in-group inequality. The paper
finds weak evidence of the impact of relative performance evaluation
on the response to inequality."
