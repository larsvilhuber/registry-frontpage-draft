abstract: "Embedding artificial intelligence-based automated feedback in teacher coaching can enhance teacher effectiveness with mathematics curriculum materials. This project will provide all teachers in this study with automated feedback and coaching on curriculum-aligned, equity-focused instructional moves. While doing so, we will vary the approach taken by this coaching to evaluate whether reflective or directive coaching is more effective in changing instructional quality and, down the line, student outcomes. This project seeks to evaluate these two models of instructional coaching by integrating state-of-the-art automated feedback on mathematics lessons with coaching routines that support teacher change. The M-Powering Teachers automated feedback tool provides teachers with feedback related to instructional moves such as focusing questions, uptake of student ideas, student idea attribution, and more. Our central goal is to design feedback and coaching experiences that maximize impact on teaching and learning, especially for historically marginalized student populations."
