abstract: "Globally, there is now greater emphasis on integrating evidence into policy making. Government policies and programs affect society at large, research generating evidence therefore needs to be credible and implemented in a transparent and ethical manner. Concerns, however, exist around the credibility, rigor, and reproducibility of existing evidence. Experts have pointed out various issues, such as selective reporting, p-hacking, lack of reproducibility, and ethical concerns plaguing social sciences research. Also, awareness and use of best practices in evidence generation remains low. Promoting adoption and integration of best practices (such as, pre-analysis plan, computational reproducibility) into research workflow becomes important to produce credible and ethical evidence. This study is an experiment to test the effectiveness of an information campaign on the uptake of the best practices to produce credible research. "
