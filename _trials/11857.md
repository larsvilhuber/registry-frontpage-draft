abstract: "Our study uses an online lab experiment to understand how human decision-makers use recommendations provided by an algorithm, and how their use of the recommendation changes as the design of the algorithm varies. The experiment will assess if human participants can effectively use a recommendation algorithm which (i) ignores all observations for which the human has perfect certainty and/or (ii) withholds recommendations selectively. In theory these targeted recommendations are more effective than a generic recommendation as the participant should ignore the recommendation if they have perfect certainty (or aren't given the recommendation).

We have designed a small hiring game that will see if participants are able to properly ignore the algorithm when given certain information while taking the algorithm's recommendation in other instances. Participants see the role applicants are applying for (Engineering, Sales, or Communications) while a recommendation algorithm assisting them is able to assess their personality type. Participants need to hire good applicants and not hire bad applicants. Interventions vary the structure of the recommendation algorithm assisting the participants.
