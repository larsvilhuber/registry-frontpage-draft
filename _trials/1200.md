abstract: "Smallholder farmers in low income countries often invest a large proportion of their production costs in fertilizer, however returns on this investment can be highly variable and maximum potential productivity gains are very rarely achieved (Beaman et al. 2013; Duflo et al. 2008; Suri 2011). Experimental evidence points to the need for balanced nutrient application in order to maximize the efficiency of each synthetic compound (Das et al. 2009). However in order to effectively optimize fertilizer use efficiency, targeted advice needs to be generated at the individual level based on current soil fertility status as well as the nutrient demands of the cropping system (Das et al. 2009). At present, most farmers rely on blanket fertilizer recommendations which fails to account for this variability. The emphasis on nitrogen based fertilizers also implies that the supply chains for other nutrients have not been well established. As a result even if farmers had the knowledge allowing them to adopt more effective fertilizer application practices, appropriate and timely supply of fertilizer may still remain a major constraint. Here we will investigate the constraints to adoption of a new affordable automated system for delivering balanced fertilizer recommendations as compared to government soil testing laboratories. "
