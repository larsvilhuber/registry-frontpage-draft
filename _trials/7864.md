abstract: "The number of COVID-19 infections and deaths are still rising despite many countries implementing strict social distancing and hygienic preventive measures. Widespread vaccination is essential to curb the spread of the pandemic. However, because of the benefits of herd immunity, a vaccine is most effective if a large majority of the population accepts and uses it.

Public vaccine hesitancy is a large public health issue in general. However, especially in the case of the COVID-19 vaccine, concern about the safety of the vaccine due to the shortened research and testing period and the effectiveness of the vaccine due to the mutations of the virus further fuel hesitance towards a COVID-19 vaccine. Moreover, misinformation and conspiracy theories lead to misinformation and the erosion of trust.

In this paper, we conduct a message experiment using a representative random sample of over 4,000 households in Accra, Ghana, based on the latest Ghana Living Standard Survey (GLSS7). The experiment tests different messages about vaccinating against COVID-19 in July, where vaccines have become partially available in the country to certain groups. Participants are randomized into one of eight treatment arms or the control arm. We will analyze the impact of the messages on (i) the general perceived importance of the vaccine, (ii) the reported willingness to get the vaccine, (iii) the reported willingness to get the vaccine – even when a person has to pay for it, (iv) the reported willingness to get the vaccine via lottery, (v) the reported willingness to get the vaccine – when  a person gets monetary compensation for the vaccine, and (vi) the urge for a vaccine mandate.  

We contribute to the current literature by first providing evidence on COVID-19 vaccine attitudes at the start of the COVID-19 vaccine campaign; therefore, reducing the uncertainty people had about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine in studies half a year ago. Second, since attitudes are highly country-specific, we can provide first empirical evidence for Ghana. Third, our experiment includes the poorest population and thus provides new insights into the population which research assumes has the lowest knowledge and the most hesitancy with respect to vaccines. Moreover, the poor are highly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and it is essential to better understand the most vulnerable in a society. Fourth, the experiment is conducted based on a phone survey, enabling us to directly contact the participants and avoid biases due to access to the internet or due to illiteracy – which is very likely when including the poorest households. Lastly, since this experiment is part of a larger research project, we can not only measure the effect of a message but can also contribute to the current literature about factors associated with the intention to get COVID-19 vaccine. Besides socioeconomic factors, additional covariates will be added to the model, i.e. COVID-19 knowledge, following hygienic and social distancing measures, COVID-19 experience, trust in government, citizens, media, and science, general vaccine attitude, and information sources.
