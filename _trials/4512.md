abstract: "The experimental design is conceived, in order to investigate how the influence of policy interventions, which target pro-environmental behavior, can lead to different degrees of behavioral spillover effects. We center the analysis on policy measures ranging from liberal paternalism to enforced regulation. Thereby, we exploit a characteristic of these measures; namely, the variations in subjectsâ€™ perceived voluntariness to conduct the targeted behavior. The perception of choosing a moral behavior voluntarily leaves room for warm glow and intrinsic motivation, which are assumed to mediate behavioral spillover effects. The experimental analysis will be conducted in a between-subject design with a non-student sample. The experiment consists of two subsequent pro-environmental tasks, for which extrinsic motivation is induced using three different policy interventions, comprising of either nudge, a monetary incentive or enforced compliance. Based on insights from the literature suggesting that the degree of voluntariness is pivotal for the size of behavioral spillover effects, we hypothesize that a larger the degree of perceived voluntariness in the first task, leads to lower effort in the second pro-environmental task.
