abstract: "COVID-19 shuttered schools for over a billion children, resulting in substantial learning losses. Institutions such as the World Bank, UNESCO, and UNICEF have issued considerable policy guidance on evidence-based best practices to recover learning losses. These include extending instructional time, conducting remedial education classes, and regular learning assessments. How realistic is it to implement these best practices? This study provides some of the first empirical evidence of teachers’ awareness, willingness, and implementation of learning loss recovery programs. We collect ground truth estimates by surveying teachers across three countries: Bangladesh, India, and Nepal. Further, we evaluate the impacts of delivering scientific evidence on the effectiveness of the global guidance on learning loss recovery using a randomized control trial by randomly assigning the teachers into four groups. The control group is only informed about the global policy in focus and is not given any evidence about its effectiveness. The three treatment groups are informed that the policy in focus is being recommended based on high-quality experimental evidence on the effectiveness from a similar or different context (Treatment 1 - Global Evidence and solution, Treatment 2 - Local Evidence, and Treatment 3 - Local evidence and solution)."
