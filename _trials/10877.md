abstract: "India has an exceptionally low female labor force participation rate despite substantial improvements in per capita GDP and female educational attainment, and fertility decline in recent decades. This issue is concerning as female labor force participation can empower women and lead to economic growth. One of the key barriers to womenâ€™s labor market engagement in India is the lack of information about the job search process, which is particularly critical during the school-to-work transition period. We conduct a randomized controlled trial with female vocational training graduates in India to examine whether access to a phone-based job information portal can overcome these barriers and improve the labor market engagement of young female jobseekers."
