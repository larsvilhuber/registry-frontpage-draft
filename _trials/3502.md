abstract: "In low- and middle-income countries, 250 million children under 5 are at risk of not reaching their full developmental potential (Black et al., 2017). These differences in development have multiple causes, including an insufficient level of cognitive stimulation, dietary deficiencies, chronic infections, and so on. Indeed, the prolonged exposure of a young child to one or more of these problems can cause changes in brain structure and function and slow the child’s development (Walker et al., 2011). In the medium term, affected children are more likely to perform poorly in school and to drop out early. In the longer term, they tend to have lower incomes and higher fertility rates. Additionally, their children are more likely to face the same development issues, thus contributing to the intergenerational transmission of poverty (Grantham-McGregor et al., 2007). 

Investing in the development of disadvantaged children from an early age is likely to limit the number of developmentally delayed children and the significant societal costs associated with them, thereby breaking the cycle of reproduction of inequality (Heckman, 2006). In this regard, investing in preschools for children aged 3 to 5 is often viewed as a particularly efficient solution. As a matter of fact, a growing number of studies show the positive impact of these institutions (see Duncan and Magnuson (2013) for a meta-analysis of studies on the US). Indeed, the curriculum followed by these preschools (generally centered on the exploration of written and spoken language, creative and motor activities, etc.) coupled with prolonged interactions with other children may be more likely to foster the development of children’s cognitive and non-cognitive skills. Preschools can also help ensure that some of the children’s basic nutritional needs are met and that they have access to basic care. Unfortunately, the number of causal evidence on the impact of preschools in lower-income countries remains extremely limited. 

As part of this project, we implement a randomized controlled trial designed to measure and compare the effectiveness of community-based preschools and of a program aiming to improve learning conditions during the first years of primary school."
