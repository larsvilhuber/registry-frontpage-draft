abstract: "This project explores the impact of measurement on survey responses. We hypothesize that the very act of measuring survey responses can affect the distribution of those responses. We design and implement an experiment that mimics the famous double slit experiment of Thomas Young (1801) demonstrating wave-particle duality for light depending on whether its passage through double slits is subject to detection of which slit the light particle went through. In our experiment, subjects are asked to respond to a survey question by providing a numerical response on a given scale. In the control treatment, their numerical answer is recorded and reported back to participants. This is analogous to the physics experiment where a detector identifies the slit through which a particle went through. Alternatively, in a second treatment, we measure whether subjects' response "passes," through one of the slits but without eliciting information to identify which slit. In either treatment, subjects who "pass" through are then asked to consider the same survey question again and to provide a second numerical answer which is again recorded and reported back to subjects. More precisely, the main treatment modifies the control treatment in one important respect. Subjects are asked to “think” about their numerical response to the same survey question posed in the control treatment and to hold that number in memory.  Their response to the survey question is NOT directly measured/observed. Instead, they are then asked whether their numerical answer lies within the two subsets of answers used in the control treatment (the two slits).  If it is, then, as in the control treatment, they will be asked to  evaluate the survey question once again, and in this second instance, their answers to the question will be recorded and reported back to them. We hypothesize that, like light (and other subatomic particles), survey responses by subjects in our main treatment, where survey questions are not directly measured tin the first round measurement, will display a wave-like interference pattern in the second round measurement. We also hypothesize that such an interference pattern will not be observed in our control treatment, where survey answers are directly measured to determine which slit the subjects responses pass through."
