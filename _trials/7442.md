abstract: "Little is known about how relative performance feedback in higher education based on performance measures such as obtained credits can be designed in order to increase academic achievement of students across the entire performance distribution. In addition, past research was often conducted with students from specific study programs. Against this background, we will assign students from 21 different study programs to different types of relative performance feedback and track their study progress in the short and in the long run."
