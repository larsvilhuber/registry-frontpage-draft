abstract: "Developing countries have experienced only slight improvements in the learning outcomes
of students in recent years. The World Bank (2018) notes that one reason driving this
issue is that teachers are not effective because they lack both skills and motivation. While
upgrading teachers skills might not be always feasible (due to a lack of resources and/or
state capacity), cost-effective campaigns to improve their motivation might prove crucial.
We conduct a Clustered Randomized Control Trial in Peruvian public schools to test whether
the announcement of a non-monetary award offered to teachers based on their performance
shows any effect over it and subsequently over the learning outcomes of students.
