abstract: "In this study we experimentally investigate a link between students’ interests and learning. We test whether students’ performance on exam questions is causally related to whether learning is assessed through questions that align with their interests. Using the setting of a large introductory economics class at a private university in Western U.S., we elicit students' interests in the beginning of the semester using an online survey. We will then experimentally vary test questions in their relevance to these interests. Examining student performance on these test questions will allow us to assess whether student performance is affected by the degree to which test questions align with their interests."
