abstract: "We collect data from a laboratory experiment to investigate the belief-based component of the utility function. The experiment consists of two parts: an IQ test and a learning exercise. In the main treatment, every participant observes a signal about his relative performance in the IQ test. The signal is either perfectly informative or entirely uninformative with equal probability. Then the participant is asked to report his subjective probability of the signal being indicative of his performance. In the control treatment, participants do not observe signals but are asked to submit reports for each possible signal realization. We assume that a signal about cognitive ability received in the main treatment affects subjects' belief-based utility, while a signal that is being considered in the control treatment does not. This allows us to empirically investigate the belief-based component of the utility function and estimate its parameters at the population level, as well as for groups of individuals with similar characteristics. Moreover, we plan to use the data from the main treatment to reconcile contradictory evidence on asymmetric updating (Eil and Rao, 2011; Mobius et al, 2014; Schwardmann and van der Weele, 2016; Buser et al., 2018; Coutts, 2018) and further investigate the role of expectations in beliefs formation. In particular, we plan to examine beliefs updating about events to which subjects assign zero prior probability. Last but not least, we use additional survey data to examine the occurrence of time inconsistency in belief formation arising due to anticipatory feelings over upcoming signal realizations. Therefore, we plan to test the psychological expected utility theory formulated by Caplin and Leahy (2001). "
