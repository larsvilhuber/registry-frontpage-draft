abstract: "Violent conflicts have negative effects on prosperity and development. Reconstruction efforts require that qualified labor force is willing to work in highly violent areas. In this project we use a field experiment to investigate the impact of conflict on labor markets. Our focus is on the qualifications and gender of the pool of applicants.  We built a pool of job-seekers and offer  comparable jobs in either a low or high conflict area in Colombia. We investigate  whether an increase in salary helps to attract more qualified workers and restore gender balancedness in applications. "
