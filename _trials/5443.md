abstract: "Managers often try to encourage their employees to generate and share creative ideas as to how to increase firm performance and improve job satisfaction. Soliciting creative ideas can be difficult for a number of reasons discussed in the literature. Some research suggests that subordinates may be reluctant to convey certain types of creative ideas to their superiors, for fear of scrutiny. In addition, there is mixed evidence as to whether incentives drive or curb creativity. If incentives can be used to successfully solicit creative ideas, an open question is how the risk structure of such incentives affects a workerâ€™s likelihood to generate and share their ideas. We will conduct a field experiment in a nationwide education program to determine how the type of evaluator and proposed incentive structures affect the creativity of ideas shared by employees."
