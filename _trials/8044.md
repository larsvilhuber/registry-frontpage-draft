abstract: "’Smart devices’ are products with extra functionality to connect to the internet (like smart lights, TVs, and watches). Internationally, cyber security labels have been introduced to help consumers choose smart devices that are more cyber secure. BETA is collaborating with the Department of Home Affairs to evaluate the effectiveness of cyber security labels in the Australian context, to test how they influence people’s purchasing decisions, and how they increase awareness about the risks of insecure smart devices."
