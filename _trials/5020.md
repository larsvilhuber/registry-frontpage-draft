abstract: "We study the determinants of biases in subjective performance evaluations in an MTurk experiment. In the experiment subjects in the role of workers work on a real effort task. Subjects in the role of supervisors observe subsamples of the workers’ output and assess their performance. We conduct 6 experimental treatments varying (i) whether workers’ pay depends on the performance evaluation (ii) whether supervisors are paid for the accuracy of their evaluations and (iii) the precision of the information available to supervisors. We study the effects of these treatments on rating leniency (the extent to which ratings exceed true performance) and rating compression (determined by the extent to which ratings vary with observed information)."
