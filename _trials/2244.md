abstract: "The prevalence of overweight and obesity in Mexican public schools affects one third of the students in primary education. The students are surrounded by a plentiful supply of foods with high contents of energy, fats and sugars. Survey data show that the conventional intervention of providing nutritional information to food consumers fails to reach most of the population. The latest official survey of health conditions, ENSANUT 2016, revealed that 76.3% of adults nationwide do not know or did not respond to the question of how many daily calories are recommended for them, while only 40.6% read the nutritional labels of the foods they eat. To remedy this situation, the Mexican government has designed a school-based intervention (Salud en tu Escuela) with the aim of reducing the prevalence of overweight and obesity in primary schools. The intervention is composed of three main components: 
(1) Baseline measurement of height, weight and BMI of children, with information sent to parents.
(2) Physical activation by promoting extra-curricular sport practices, 
(3) A school-based campaign to raise awareness of appropriate food consumption behavior among students, parents and teachers. 
The program pilot is set to be rolled out in the school period of 2017/2018 with a randomized controlled trial in 13 participating federal entities. We randomized 1,560 schools to three groups. First, 520 schools to a treatment group (with interventions 1, 2 and 3); second, 520 schools to a control group (with intervention 1 only) and third, 520 schools to a "pure" control group  (with no interventions).  
The objective of this impact evaluation is to identify the causal effects of the program on knowledge, food habits, and body mass index (BMI) of school children in public primary schools in Mexico. Baseline data have been collected from before the intervention in August 2017 and follow-up observations were collected at the end of the school year in May 2018."
