abstract: "The goal of the experiment is to test the existence of a causal effect of earnings uncertainty on labour supply at the extensive margin in the presence of out-of-work benefits. The design of the experiment is strongly inspired by how zero hours contracts work, i.e. what is uncertain is not the pay rate itself but the availability of work. At the same time, if work is not available, participants do not have an alternative possibility of gaining income but they do gain ‘leisure’. The experiment aims to study the decision to take up a job with insecure pay when there is an alternative out of work benefit that is lost. "
