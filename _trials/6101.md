abstract: "Virtually all internet job boards now recommend jobs to the workers who use their platforms. These job recommendations are generated by algorithms, using criteria that include the worker’s characteristics and previous search behaviors, and the match between the worker’s characteristics and the job’s requirements. While job recommendation algorithms have the potential to help workers find their preferred jobs faster and to improve worker-job match quality, they also have sparked deep concern about the fairness of the job recommendation algorithms: even when this is not intended by the designers, the recommended jobs may reinforce gender and other stereotypes. We plan to conduct a resume audit study on several leading online job boards in China to learn whether, to what extent, and how job board algorithms systematically treat male and female job seekers differently. Specifically, we will collect the jobs that are recommended to fictitious workers who have identical backgrounds except for gender, compare the job recommendation outcomes and measure the difference of outcomes between two gender groups."
