abstract: "Addressing climate change requires immediate government action in high-emitting countries like the US. Moreover, continuing to enact climate policy under a newly split US Congress will require bipartisan action. In this project, we test whether opportunities to invite others to take political action, as well as receiving these invitations, increases political climate advocacy. We explore these questions in an online experiment with participants recruited via social media. "
