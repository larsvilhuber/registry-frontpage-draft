abstract: "We use a randomized controlled trial that combines increased instruction time (a teaching program of two lessons per week in 16 weeks in 5th grade) with information to the teachers about their students’ performance in monthly reading tests. The trial was conducted in grade 5 classrooms in Danish schools in the fall of the school year 2014/15. We find that the intervention improved students’ reading skills. We also find that the intervention reduced teachers’ tendency to underestimate their students’ reading skills (relative to computer-based test scores), that it was most effective for students with underestimated reading skills at baseline, and that these effects were strongest for low-SES students.
