abstract: "The emergence of low-skill manufacturing sectors in developing countries can provide economic benefits, especially for women, but working conditions are often difficult.  We propose a cluster RCT to experimentally investigate whether information and search frictions in Bangladesh’s labor market contribute to inefficient matching between garment workers and firms.  We will use data from a baseline household survey to measure working conditions and wages across garment factories in local labor markets. We will then provide this information on job characteristics, job openings, or both, and assess the impacts of these treatments on workers’ beliefs about working conditions (and wages) in garment factories nearby to their home, mobility, wages, and working conditions.
