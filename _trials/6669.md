abstract: "I estimate how much individuals are willing to accept corruption and how this acceptance threshold can be influenced by their environment. 
Through an online survey, I ask respondents if they are willing to vote for a certain competent politician who embezzled some money or not. By changing the amount of money embezzled I am able to estimate the threshold level at which each respondent is still willing to vote for that given politician. 
To identify possible causes that affect this acceptance level, I conduct different experiments during the survey. The first experiment looks at the impact of others' acceptance on your own. The second experiment investigate how a perceived higher frequency of corruption affects your acceptance level.
I also provide descriptive results on how the acceptance level correlates with various background characteristics of the respondents. Asking question also on policy preferences, will allow me to see how various level of acceptance are correlated with these preferences. I also shows some evidence on how thinking about corruption may affect the preferences on the role and size of the government."
