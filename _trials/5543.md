abstract: "Women are underrepresented in leadership positions across many contexts in both private and public spheres. The proposed research programme aims to study one of the potential barriers to gender equality by examining the biases that managers hold when providing feedback to their employees. Biases in feedback communication can be detrimental to employees’ self-confidence, which may in turn reduce their willingness to compete for promotions or roles with better career prospects. Hence, understanding these biases and their impact on behaviour is an important first step to breaking down the barriers inhibiting women from taking up leadership roles. Using a controlled lab experiment, we will examine whether managers provide feedback differently to employees based on their gender. Our experimental design will allow us to examine the relationship between feedback provision and managers’ own incentives, and the impact that biased performance feedback may have on employees’ behaviour and outcomes."
