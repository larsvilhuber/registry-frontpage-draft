abstract: "We have previously conducted an experiment where we nd that females have less sway in group decision making than males and in particular unprepared females have less sway than unprepared males. We do not, however, find the same gender bias between prepared males and females. This may come about because unprepared females are less condent than
unprepared males, and thus talk less, or express their opinions in a less convincing way than their male counterparts. It could also be the case that other group members give less weight to unprepared females than unprepared males for other reasons than the behavior of the unprepared group members, where other group members nd it more problematic that women are unprepared than men either because of differences in beliefs about these two groups (statistical discrimination) or because of implicit biases or preference based discrimination. 

In order to both gain knowledge about the generality of our findings from
the experiment, and in order to investigate the potential mechanisms for the observed behavior, we plan to conduct a survey experiment. This pre-analysis plan explains how we will collect data as the well as the empirical strategy for analysing these data."
