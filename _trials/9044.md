abstract: "I consider a setting of delegated risk taking. Agents choose between a first-order stochastically dominant and a dominated lotteries. Principals observe choices and outcomes and then decide whether to award a bonus payment to the agent. The goal of this experiment is to study whether outcome bias (OB), that is a tendency to condition bonus payments on outcomes, can shape the incentives faced by agent and thereby their choices. In particular, I seek to address the following research questions. 1) Can outcome bias in bonus payments induce incentives to choose ex-ante inferior lotteries? 2) Do agents adjust their choices accordingly, i.e. can outcome bias induce more choices of first-order stochastically dominated lotteries?"
