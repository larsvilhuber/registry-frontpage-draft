abstract: "Within a large retail discounter we monetarily incentivize a key performance variable, the normalized average receipt, for a randomly assigned set of middle (district) managers in one region. As a robustness check we used a different region in which we do almost the same procedure and intervention but without a monetary incentive. The middle management of this region receives a kick-off mail stating that the focus should be on the performance of the average receipt for the next months and they receive an additional feedback about their performance each month. This allows us to control whether a change in the performance is due to the monetary incentive or due to salience of the performance."
