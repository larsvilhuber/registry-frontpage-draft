abstract: "We randomly assign women participants to one of three conditions. One third of participants are invited to attend Storytelling for Leadership (SfL), a two-day workshop that teaches leadership skills by teaching participants to self-reflect and develop a personal narrative. One third of participants are invited to attend a professional development (PD) workshop, which teaches participants skills including public speaking, networking, goal setting, and identifying new opportunities. The final third of participants are not invited to attend a workshop, but instead receive the per-participant cost of the workshop in cash, approximately USD 35. We hypothesize that women who participated in the Storytelling for Leadership (SfL) workshop will express higher socio-emotional gains than women who participated in the professional development (PD) workshop, and both SfL and PD participants will express higher socio-emotional gains than women in the cash control group, and that these effects hold even when controlling for economic gains. Furthermore, we hypothesize that women who participated in the Storytelling for Leadership (SfL) workshop will express higher economic gains than women who participated in the professional development (PD) workshop, and both SfL and PD participants will express higher economic gains than women in the cash control group.
