abstract: "In the absence of complete information about individual characteristics, employers use informative signals to form beliefs about the ability of a worker. In this experiment, we test 1) whether people are Bayesian updaters when considering the ability of others and 2) whether such updating depends on the identity group of the worker. If there is different updating based on a workerâ€™s identity, we will test whether this leads to different hiring rates for different identities."
