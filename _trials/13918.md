abstract: "In this study we test how psychology based empowerment training for women changes their psychological well-being, women’s empowerment, their decision for adoption of nutrition dense maize seeds in Ethiopia, and ultimately food security. We test this through setting up a randomized control trial as well as a Becker-de Groot Marshak (BDM) experiment in the Oromia region in the country. Specifically, we test whether removing internal constraints for female farmers through psychology training on empowerment can improve women’s empowerment, their psychological well-being, their health, improved seed adoption, and household food security. We further test the effect of relieving external constraints through provision of subsidy to purchase improved seeds and lastly the joint effect of the training and subsidy on the outcomes of interest."
