abstract: "Low consumption of fruits and vegetables is a rising global health concern in both low and high-income economies.  As countries become increasingly urbanized, ultra-processed foods high in fat, salt, and sugar become increasingly popular, contributing to the triple burden of malnutrition. Given that affordability is a major determinant of households' food consumption choices, we will estimate the effect of increasing affordability of fruits and vegetables in Nigeria and Vietnam by providing households with weekly coupons for discounts on the prices of certain fruits and vegetables at their local markets. The intervention will be implemented as a randomized control trial (RCT), with two treatment groups and a control group, to allow for causal estimates of the impact of these coupons.  Households in treatment group one will receive coupons that are half as large as the coupons given to treatment group two to test the difference between an inframarginal coupon (one that is below their existing consumption level), and an extramarginal coupon (one that is above their existing consumption level)."
