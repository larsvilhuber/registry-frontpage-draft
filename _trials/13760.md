abstract: "The emergence of algorithm-generated financial advice challenges the traditional market for financial delegation, which strongly relies on human-generated advice. Despite the fact that such robo-advisors may provide opportunities for a large number of household investors, they may refrain from utilizing such advisors due to a phenomenon commonly referred to as algorithm aversion: Individuals typically favor a human advisor when choosing between algorithmic and human forecasters, even when they know that algorithms exhibit a better forecasting accuracy. This study investigates algorithm aversion in the context of financial delegation using a lab experiment. We exogenously manipulate the advisor type (human vs. algorithm) and measure individualsâ€™ belief formation about the fundamental quality of recommended assets and the quality of the assigned advisor (i.e., the amount of information available to the advisor). We then observe subsequent investor decisions. Under the algorithm aversion hypothesis, we expect participants who receive advice from an algorithm to be less confident about the fundamental quality of the asset and about the quality of the advisor. Additionally, we expect this belief to affect subsequent investment decisions, such as a lower willingness to take risk and a higher propensity to switch advisors when provided with the opportunity among those in the algorithm treatment."
