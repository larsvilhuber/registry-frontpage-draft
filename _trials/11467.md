abstract: "Heavy childcare responsibilities can negatively impact both women's economic outcomes and well-being. A growing literature has shown positive impacts of gaining access to childcare, although there remains almost no evidence of what types of services work best and the implications of different alternatives. In a sample of 972 women working in six markets in the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area, Uganda, this project uses a randomized controlled trial to test and contrast the impacts of gaining free access to two alternative childcare services frequently considered by policy-makers. The first has been set up as a publicly provisioned model of workplace-based childcare, situated in or adjacent to the markets where women work. The second leverages existing private sector childcare service providers located in the communities near where women live.
