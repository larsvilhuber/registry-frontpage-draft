abstract: "This study will is based on an online survey that we will administer to an adult panel. The randomization component is that different respondents will be presented with different probabilities of a potential lottery outcome. Our hypothesis is that the happiness/satisfaction level after a good and bad outcome will depend on both whether the lottery payoff was a good or bad outcome and whether the probability of this outcome was high or low. 

The survey will also collect information on risk beliefs. Our hypotheses are i) that people will assess bad outcomes as having a lower probability than good outcomes, ii) that people will overestimate small risks and underestimate large risks, and that biases in risk beliefs also will influence attitudes toward probabilities more generally.
