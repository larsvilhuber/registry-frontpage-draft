abstract: "We compare investment decisions under risk (known probability of investment success) vs. ambiguity (unknown probability). We introduce ambiguity into the investment task developed by Gneezy and Potters (1997) and examine its impact on investment decisions, breaking it down into two components: a noisy prediction channel and an ambiguity attitudes channel."
