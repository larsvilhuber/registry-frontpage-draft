abstract: "We will conduct a randomized controlled experiment targeting a sample of 300 low-income families with young children (with at least one child between 2 and 6 years old). The interventions aim at encouraging low-income families to break unhealthy dietary habits and adopt healthier ones for a period of 12 weeks. We aim at studying the long-term effects of these interventions.

The interventions will be conducted following a randomised control trial protocol, whereby a third of the sample will be assigned to each of the treatments and the remaining third will serve as a control group. We will study short and medium term effects of the intervention by following people over time and collecting information on dietary choices and health outcomes, including body weight, height, and health biomarkers. 

We will collect information before, during and after the intervention (each year after the intervention for a period of 3 years). 

The effects will be estimated using a difference-in-differences approach, i.e. comparing variables of interest (dietary choices, preferences and health biomarkers) for the treated groups to those observed in the control groups. The goal here will be to document the average treatment effect on diet and health.
