abstract: "In much of the United States there are increasing concerns over the availability of agricultural labor. In 2017, 68%  of US based agricultural laborers were from Mexico, and in California alone, 89\% were from Mexico, while only 9\% were U.S. born. Many of these workers are now transitioning away farm labor either because of retirement, or they are moving to other labor markets (e.g. construction). In addition, there are few replacements for these workers. This study aims to estimate the casual estimates of worker productivity in response to bonus changes. We randomize the sequence of bonus payments assigned to each crew and worker for the duration of five weeks in order to estimate a) the productivity response to said bonuses and b) the peer worker effects of bonuses within each crew. This will enable us to test the resposivness of farm workers to changes in bonus pay size and time. "
