abstract: "The experiment aims to test whether automatic enrolment of potential participants to the distance learning course (DLC) with an option to opt-out will increase the enrolment rates compared to self-enrollment condition. In addition, the experiment seeks to assess if participants who self-enroll into the course will perform better than the ones who were automatically enrolled. To measure the impact of the proposed intervention, the data on the number of participants registered for the course and the number of participants that successfully completed the course will be recorded."
