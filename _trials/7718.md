abstract: "In an online lab experiment, participants are asked to design two drafts of a recruitment poster for the lab. Before they complete the second draft, they receive a review of their first draft from one of the other participants. Participants are allocated to different "feedback groups": in one group, pairs of participants review each other (sequentially); in another group, participants are matched anonymously. Subjects' payments are based on the peer feedback for the first draft (within a tournament) and on researchers' grading of the second draft. We study how feedback groups affect performance in the second poster and contribution in a public good game subjects play at the end of the session, as well as feedback content."
