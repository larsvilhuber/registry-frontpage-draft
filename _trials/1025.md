abstract: "Sports betting has become very popular across many countries in sub-Saharan Africa over the last decade.  It is a multi-million dollar industry in many developing countries and continues to expand.  This study looks at sports betting behavior among bettors in Kampala, Uganda and seeks to identify causal factors contributing to high betting intensity and prevalence.  We will employ randomized treatments to identify possible behavioral biases contributing to high betting intensity.  We will also employ quasi-experimental methods to analyze additional causes as well as the impacts of betting participation that cannot be explored experimentally."
