abstract: "Improving educational attainment is an important concern for policy makers and academics. Despite significant progress in increasing enrolment at all levels of education, only half of the students in Punjab, Pakistan who appear for exams secure passing marks at undergraduate level (Punjab Development Statistics, 2016). Literature provides modest evidence of improvement in academic performance through instructional, health and nutrition interventions; and financial incentives to teachers and parents. Recent developments in behavioral economics suggests that low cost behavioral and psychological interventions that focus on development of non-cognitive skills can achieve the desired improvement in learning outcomes within existing educational systems without requiring the usual costly structural changes. We propose a soft touch, low cost intervention provided through visual aids, discussions and flyers to develop non-cognitive skills (in particular grit and a growth mindset) to overcome constraints to academic performance for college students. Specifically, our intervention aims to test if highlighting the importance of perseverance; and beliefs about intelligence and ability prompt behavior that translates into improved academic performance. We conduct a pilot to test the effectiveness of our intervention on a randomly selected sample of 360 students in 10 women-only, public colleges in Lahore, Punjab.
