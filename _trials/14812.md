abstract: "Does risk aversion prevent firms from adopting new products? This study offers firms new motorcycle helmets with or without an insurance contract and examines whether insurance increases uptake. Treated shops are offered the ability to choose between a guaranteed future cash payment or a larger payment that pays out only if the shops struggles to sell helmets, calibrated so that the value of the contracts is similar in expectation. The control group receives the guaranteed payment. I test for risk aversion by examine whether being offered the insurance contract increases adoption. In a secondary component, the markets entered at baseline are randomized to test for information externalities at a follow-up by examining whether shops in markets with an entrant are more willing to purchase helmet stock."
