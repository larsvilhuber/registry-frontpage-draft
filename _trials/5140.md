abstract: "The literature often treat time discounting as an inherent preferences and estimate it with the assumption that people can clearly foresee future situations. This paper investigates whether imperfect foresight affects intertemporal choice using three designs. We first exogenously introduce forecasting difficulty in the form of ambiguity in return of money allocated to a given period and find subjects avoid allocating money to this period. We then use summer vacation as the natural period of increased forecasting difficulty. Comparing the same intertemporal choice made by the same subject but at two different times relative to summer vacation, we find that subjects avoid allocating money to summer. After writing down their plans for summer vacation, subjects are more willing to allocate money to summer. These findings provide strong evidence on the role of imperfect foresight on time discounting."
