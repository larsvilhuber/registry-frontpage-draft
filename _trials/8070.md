abstract: "In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination campaigns try to further increase vaccination rates. In written reminders, we include behavioral interventions and test their influence on vaccination rates. The study comprises three distinct projects. Project 1 examines the effect of written reminders on vaccination decisions by comparing vaccination rates in our sample to an untreated comparison group. Project 2 tests the effect of social norm information included in the written reminder on the vaccination decision. Project 3 looks at the influence of a mobile vaccination team, offering on site vaccination where no appointment is needed."
