abstract: "We designed a field experiment to study tax avoidance among households. The subjects in our field experiment are households who pay property taxes and face the opportunity to legally reduce their property taxes via filing a tax appeal. We invite a sample of households' to complete a survey. Within a survey, we conduct an information-provision experiment. We then measure how the information affects their posterior beliefs and the subsequent decision to appeal property taxes (based on administrative records)."
