abstract: "We conduct a randomised control trial to evaluate the impact of a travel independence training programme for children with special educational needs aged between eleven and sixteen attending secondary schools in Norfolk, England - Ready to Go! (RTG). The program was created by Norfolk County Council as a segway into their flagship TITAN+ program, a one-to-one travel independence training for pupils aged over 16, which has demonstrable success in growing teenage childrenâ€™s confidence and preparing them to travel independently."
