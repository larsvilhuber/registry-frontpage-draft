abstract: "The paper evaluates a new intervention seeking to address the problem of youth violence. Choose to Change (C2C) is a program that combines trauma focused cognitive behavioral therapy with wraparound services. This is the first time that these services are being offered together and rigorously evaluated. C2C will serve at least 570 at-risk youth during the years 2015-2019 in various neighborhoods of the South Side of Chicago, with a possibility for future cohorts. As there is little definitive evidence on the effectiveness of intensive services programs for high-risk youth, identifying programs that are successful with this population is a key policy priority for many cities across the country.
