abstract: "Symbolic recognition can be an efficient and powerful tool for motivating people. Despite much research on ex ante announced symbolic incentives, little is known about the spillover effect of different recognition types in a multitask setting. In this laboratory experiment we examine not only positive but also negative symbolic recognition and its spillover effects. Secondary school students work on two different tasks. In the experimental treatment, students receive unannounced symbolic performance feedback for the first task. We are interested in gender differences for the spillover effect of recognition on performance in the second task.
This experiment is a follow-up study designed to collect more data as suggested by two referees. Experimental design and procedures are the same as in the first study.
