abstract: "We test whether the return to digital advertising differs by firm size using data from a large-scale randomized control trial on Facebook. We conduct thousands of experiments that randomly assign users to test and control conditions, where treatment users are eligible to see ads from the advertiser in question but control users are not. We then conduct a meta-analysis using the cross-section of advertising treatment effects to test for a systematic firm-size difference. Of interest is whether advertising effects are systematically larger for smaller firms. Our findings will shed light on whether digital advertising lowers the marketing barriers to entry that have facilitated market concentration in 20th century consumer goods markets. "
