abstract: "We study whether incentivizing parents to participate in a coordinated school information campaign, in coordination with the school's leadership team, can improve the school's performance and parental involvement in standardized tests. For a subset of private and public schools in the Dominican Republic that have previously formed their respective school's parents committee, we divide the schools into control and treatment groups with the aim of better informing parents about the school's performance in past exams. For the treatment schools, we call all the parents in the committees to ask for their consent to be included in a WhatsApp group. Through this channel we then inform parents about the school's performance and a workshops that the school leadership team is required to organize with teachers and parents to discuss school quality and an action plan help them improve in future tests.
