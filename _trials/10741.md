abstract: "China's rapid economic development and its central role in driving globalization have significantly expanded its economic ties with the European Union (EU) over the past few decades. However, in recent years, geopolitical tensions have raised concerns within the EU about whether to further strengthen investment ties with China. This project focuses on a crucial aspect of these economic relations: Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) between China and Germany, one of China's largest investment partners within the EU.

We propose to conduct a randomized information-provision survey experiment to gauge the German public’s opinions on inward Chinese FDIs in Germany. This study will first investigate whether there are significant misperceptions among the German public regarding the actual figures and current status of Chinese FDIs in Germany. Secondly, we will examine the contrasting causal effects of negative and positive narratives about Chinese FDIs versus factual information of Chinese FDIs in Germany on shaping preferences towards these investments.

Given the close bilateral economic relationship between China and Germany, it is equally important to understand Chinese perceptions of German investments. Therefore, we will conduct an auxiliary survey experiment in China to measure the Chinese public's attitudes towards German FDIs in China. Given the relatively favorable portrayal of German investments in China, we aim to observe if there is a significant discrepancy in mutual perceptions of the economic benefits or threats posed by each other."
