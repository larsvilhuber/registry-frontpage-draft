abstract: "South Asia is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change impacts but also one with vast untapped renewable energy potential (World Bank, 2021). Pakistan, for example, is endowed with huge solar energy resources and utilizing just 0.071% of the country’s area for solar photovoltaic installations would meet its current electricity needs (World Bank, 2021). The transition to renewables would help the country not only fulfil its growing energy demand and curb its carbon emissions, but also mitigate the high cost and unreliability of electricity from the grid, which is almost universally cited by local firms as a major constraint to competitiveness (Bacon, 2019). While larger exporting firms have begun to adopt solar energy also to comply with the environmental standards imposed by their globally branded customers, the more neglected market segment of small-medium enterprises is falling behind, according to a local source active in the solar market.
In this exploratory study, we intend to design and administer a survey across a sample of about 400 owners of small-medium manufacturing enterprises in the garment and food storage sectors in central Punjab to better understand the main structural, informational and behavioural barriers that prevent business owners from switching to greener energy sources such as solar power. In particular, we will elicit respondents’ personal preferences, beliefs and attitudes around solar energy sources, as well as their intended behaviour or expected likelihood of adopting solar energy. In addition, we aim to conduct a randomized information experiment, embedded within the same survey, to test whether specific information provision is effective at changing respondents’ beliefs, attitudes and intentions in relation to purchasing solar energy.
