abstract: "Future economic prospects may influence the likelihood of cooperation or conflict between rising and established powers. We propose to conduct a survey to examine whether a representative sample of the American population presented with an optimistic global economic growth scenario for the future and a pessimistic scenario with negative global economic prospects (in random order) will make different predictions about the likelihood of a conflict between China (a rising power) and the US (a dominant country but whose relative strength may decline) in the future.
