abstract: "This study will use a combination of experimental and quasi-experimental approaches to examine two research questions related to online mentoring for entrepreneurs. In partnership with MicroMentor, an initiative of Mercy Corps, we will examine the effectiveness of interventions to promote successful mentor-mentee connections, and overall effect of connecting with a mentor on entrepreneurial and venture-level outcomes. 
 
There is a growing body of evidence that emphasizes the critical role that mentors play in helping entrepreneurs launch and accelerate their ventures (Eesley & Wang, 2017; Spigel, 2015). However, we know little about how mentor-mentee relationships are developed in an online context (Mills et al., 2012), and what types of interventions may lead to more meaningful mentoring relationships. Additionally, practitioners and researchers are interested in examining the impact of online mentoring on entrepreneurial performance. We propose one experimental and one quasi-experimental study to examine these questions.
