abstract: "Previous studies have shown that non-sensationalist suicide portrayals in the media, particularly those that focus on coping with adverse circumstances, have the potential to reduce suicidality among audiences. However, studies aiming to investigate which characteristics of a media story of hope and recovery support this positive effect the most are scarce. There is currently a lively debate among scholars, whether or not a clinician should disclose own suicidal crises in the past to patients in order to create the potential for strong horizontal identification with the clinician and his or her own story of recovery. The present study is a randomized controlled online trial. Participants are exposed to one of three possible media stories: Group #1 is exposed to a newspaper report focusing on an interview with a suicide expert talking about overcoming suicidal crises. In this story that expert makes it clear that she has not previously experienced a suicidal crisis in her own life. Group #2 is exposed to the same article, however in this version the expert discloses that she has experienced and overcome a suicidal crisis in the past. Group #3 (control group) is exposed to an interview with an expert talking about a health topic unrelated to suicide or mental health. Data on the audienceâ€™s risk factors for suicide and knowledge about suicide are collected before the experiment (T1, baseline) and immediately after story exposure (T2)."
