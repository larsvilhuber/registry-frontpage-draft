abstract: "This research project focuses on trade barriers for small-scale cross-border traders. These traders face multiple intermediaries in the process of trading and crossing the border, increasing their -already substantial- trade costs. Traders do not always know market prices or the official rate of each intermediary and may be taken advantage of. Indeed, an asymmetry of information between traders and intermediaries or border agents about prices and rates may play a significant role in increasing trade costs, fueling corruption and affect traders' business. Through a RCT in East-Africa, I test whether giving information to traders about market prices, border prices and taxes and exchange rates can affect bargaining, lower the cost at the border and affect small-scale traders’ choices of trade route. Such reductions in trade costs may increase and/or formalize trade, increase traders’ profit and have spillover effects along the supply chain.
