abstract: "    We evaluate the impact an index-based insurance product aimed at protecting smallholder farmers against weather hazards in rural Kenya. The product aims to alleviate credit constraints by allows farmers to buy insurance with ‘bite-sized’ premium payments over a period of time. In order to test for this mechanism, we experimentally vary the time when farmers are allowed to buy the insurance: in 90 randomly selected villages farmers can buy the product up four to months prior to the planting season, in another 90 villages the farmers can only buy the product a few weeks before the planting season. Moreover, we also test for the elasticity of demand by providing subsidized insurance in 90 villages. Another 90 villages are assigned to the control. We track the same group of 2,160 farmers over a period of a year, and sell them insurance for two different agricultural seasons. Household-level data is collected at three different points in time: once prior to the start of the program, once after the completion of the first season, and again at the end of the second season. We estimate the impact of insurance on investment in agriculture, the distribution of profits, asset ownership, and subsequent demand.
