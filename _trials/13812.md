abstract: "We measure the causal impact of comment sections on social media posts promoting racial justice. Conducted in two phases, it involves an online field experiment with over millions of Facebook users. We first collect and analyze comments to understand how political ideology influences engagement with posts. We then evaluates how exposure to different comment narratives affects subsequent engagement (comments, views), intentions (clicks), and off-platform behaviors (donations, petitions). "
