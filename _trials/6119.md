abstract: "This study aims to shed light on how people response to COVID-19 antibody testing. In collaboration with Contra Costa County Health Services (CCHS), we will field two nearly identical online surveys designed to capture both individual beliefs about COVID-19 and behavior taken to mitigate the spread of the disease. The surveys will be fielded to asymptomatic people who show up to a phlebotomy clinic for routine clinician-ordered lab tests and are not explicitly coming for COVID-19 testing. By (randomly) offering some people coming in for lab work a free blood antibody test at the same time, we will be able to study not only how testing affects beliefs about exposure as well as  preventive behavior. We can also characterize who takes up the offer of the antibody test. "
