abstract: "The effect of integrated transformative education (TE) strategies on student’s learning outcomes of conventional undergraduate physiotherapy education: 

The need of imparting TE strategies into teaching-learning process is increasing with globalization and with advent of interprofessional education. LANCET experts committee (2010) report on Medical Education expressed Freire’s concepts of critical pedagogy and Mezirow’s transformation theory as a basis to educate new century health professionals for the labour markets of health and education system.1 They proposed a competency based education model that was derived on the basis of heath needs and social accountability.  Both local and global health needs and social accountability were the theme of origin to generate competencies for the curriculum which constantly meets day to day demand. Further Lancet report recommended the transformative education equipped with problem based teaching and competency driven curriculum with leadership attributes rather being a professional of a discipline. In spite of above directions, the current format of health education may not resonant with these directions. Apart from discipline knowledge and problem solving, transformative education targets leadership (work as group and support each other), global and cultural competency (ability to work with diverse cultural population and engaged in current heath care events and treatment trends), service learning & civic engagement, and health & wellness of the learner. Further transformative education provides opportunities to develop critical thinking skills, effective communication and team collaboration, which aims for the common clinical goal rather than segregated multidisciplinary distinct goals.2, 3   
This study will evaluate the impact of integrated transformative education strategies into conventional under-graduate physiotherapy curriculum particularly in the competencies related to a) knowledge, b) problem solving and c) global and cultural efficiency.
