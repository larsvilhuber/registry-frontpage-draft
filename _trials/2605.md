abstract: "This laboratory experiment is aimed at examining the effect of malus contracts in a principal agent relationship. In particular, we want to understand whether the agent’s experience of a malus (having to pay back money to the principal) subsequently leads to a decrease in reciprocal behavior of the agent toward the principal. In order to study this question we will compare behavior in a malus treatment to behavior in a payoff-equivalent bonus treatment. Reciprocity is measured as behavior of the agent in the role of the trustee in a trust game. We will also consider whether the principal anticipates the agent’s choice by studying her decision in the role of the trustor. *In addition, we will examine the contract choice of the principal for the initial real-effort task, the number of tasks solved by the agent in the real-effort task and the impact of loss and risk aversion on all of the above outcomes. The intervention is a between-subject design. "
