abstract: "This study aims to evaluate different strategies to encourage voting participation in the context of the 2024 European elections in Italy. To achieve this objective, the project utilizes programmatic advertising, an innovative communication tool through which approximately three million video "impressions" will be distributed to Italian voters in 400 municipalities. These "impressions" will consist of "non-skippable" videos displayed on a variety of websites, including newspapers, blogs, games, and more.

The informational treatments will include four 15-second videos that differ in the message conveyed but are identical in terms of length and graphics. Group A will see the video (T1), which emphasizes the input legitimacy of European institutions, highlighting their transparency, democracy, and openness to public participation. Group B will view a second video (T2) that underscores the output legitimacy of European institutions, focusing on their ability to address issues that individual member states cannot solve alone. Group C will see the video (T3) that emphasizes the importance of European elections for the stability of Italian national politics. Group D will watch a video (T4) that explores the role of European elections in promoting the functioning and efficiency of European institutions.

Additionally, we will conduct a field experimental survey to complement the programmatic advertising and identify the mechanisms behind any observed increase in voter participation at the municipal level. Finally, using appropriate econometric techniques, we will estimate whether voter participation in municipalities exposed to programmatic advertising and the European attitudes of individuals from treated municipalities differ systematically from those of control group municipalities and individuals."
