abstract: "Our goal is to understand how firm stakeholders want a firm to behave when it is in a position to sanction a sovereign. do they think this is not the company's role to do this? do they think the company should participate to the sanction? how much of their own wealth are they willing to sacrifice for this? do they care about impact?

We conduct a survey on some 3000 US participants, using a survey firm.

We ask how participants would behave as stakeholders of a hypothetical firm. This firm has sizable operations in Russia. In the midst of the war with Ukraine, this hypothetical firm decides to not exit from Russia. Participants are asked whether they are willing to punish the firm as stakeholders. We randomize:
- which stakeholder they are (customer, shareholder, employee). for instance, employees can quit, shareholders can sell their shares, customers can boycott
- what impact they have on the firm by punishing (stock price drops, or not; firm loses on customer, or not, etc.)
- how much it will cost, to participants, to implement this punishment. 

Then, we ask how they justify their decision (impact, moral imperative, etc), and information on socio-demographics, on moral values they adhere to, political stance, etc."
