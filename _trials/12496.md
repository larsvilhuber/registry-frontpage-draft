abstract: "We are examining the superiority of a contract that grants the non-breaching party the option to choose from various remedies compared to an exclusive remedy contract, and exploring the impact of communication on the contract process. Our focus is on conditions of double-sided uncertainty and asymmetric information between a seller (who might breach) and a buyer (who never breaches). Theoretically, if the buyer's conditional expected valuation is greater than the seller's conditional expected valuation, then a contract that allows the buyer to choose between liquidated damages or specific performance (or actual damages) is considered superior. We test the theoretical results in the laboratory. In addition, by introducing communication at the stage when the seller decides whether to deliver the goods, we are investigating whether cheap talk can enhance social welfare or benefit the seller more than the buyer."
