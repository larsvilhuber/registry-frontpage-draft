abstract: "In society, we observe a large variance in outcomes for males. In the US, men occupy the majority of top level jobs, but at the same time they constitute 91 per cent of the prison population, and lag behind women in both high school and college attainment. What can explain these patterns? In this project, we study experimentally whether males are held more responsible for outcomes than females, using a novel design implemented on a representative sample of Americans. The participants make distributive choices involving men and women and we randomly manipulate the gender composition in the distributive situations. This allows us to study whether the participants to a greater extent hold stakeholders responsible for outcomes in single-sex distributive situations only involving men than in single-sex distributive situations only involving women. We also study redistributive behavior in mixed-sex environments, where we manipulate whether the male or the female has more earnings."
