abstract: "This project aims to understand information constraints  in sexual harassment awareness. The aim is to test for these constraints, filling the gaps and then understanding direct and indirect effects (externalities)  on  different groups. This project will then test whether there are any effects on economic, academic, psychological outcomes and peer relations."
