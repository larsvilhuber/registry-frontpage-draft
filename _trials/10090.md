abstract: "There is evidence that non-cognitive characteristics of school peers, such as disruptiveness or engagement impacts other students' outcomes. It remains an open question how large is the influence of disruptive peers on student outcomes. We develop a survey experiment in which individuals are exposed to randomized scenarios of students being disruptive in the classroom. Participants are asked whether they think that the scenario of disruptive students they are exposed to could influence them in terms of study motivation, career aspirations, their science study readiness, and their career readiness."
