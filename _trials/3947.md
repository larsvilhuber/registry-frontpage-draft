abstract: "The Government of Burundi wants to reduce the fertility rate by 2025 to three children per woman, from the current rate of 5.5 children per woman. Because there is a strong opposition to birth control from faith leaders, and because women who use birth control risk social isolation as a result, the government wants to introduce self-injectable contraceptives. But getting community health clinics ready to prescribe self-injectables and ensuring privacy for women will be challenging. Using data from Burundi’s health monitoring and information system, this evaluation will test different approaches for increasing adoption of these contraceptives, including financial incentives for community health volunteers and authorization for volunteers to provide the service in patients’ homes and instructions for patients to implement the necessary procedure themselves."
