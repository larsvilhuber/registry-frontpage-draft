abstract: "Developing countries are plagued with multiple institutional and market distortions. One important institutional imperfection is weak property rights over land. While land titling is expected to increase the incentives individuals have to make efficient long-term productive investments, its effectiveness might be weakened without an accompanying increase in credit supply. The core goal of this study is to shine novel light on the complementarity between strengthening land rights and relaxing credit constraints, by randomly assigning rural households in Western Uganda to four groups. The first group receives land titles, the second group receives a line of credit, the third group receives both land titles and the line of credit, and the fourth group receives no intervention. In addition, given women’s limited land rights under traditional customary land tenure systems, this study also seeks to understand the effectiveness of three instruments in promoting the take up of joint land titles: (i) the provision of information about the benefits of joint titling through a short video (rather than just generic information about titling), (ii) making the land title offer conditional on the wife’s name being included in the title (rather than making the offer unconditional), and targeting the land titling intervention to both the wife and the husband (rather than just targeting the husband)."
