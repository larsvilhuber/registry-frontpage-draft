abstract: "This impact evaluation examines the effectiveness of a nutrition and health information intervention for parents coupled with goal-setting and soft commitment. The aim of the intervention is to increase nutrition knowledge, promote healthy eating/exercise behavior and, ultimately, reduce overweight and obesity rates among schoolchildren (second to fourth grade, aged 7-10) in urban Vietnam, a prime example of a country in the health and nutrition transition that comes with rapid economic development. While stunting rates of children under 5 have fallen from 64% to 19% between 1984 and 2013 according to the World Health Organization, childhood obesity rates have increased rapidly over the last decade. According to the Center of Nutrition in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), in 2013, 38.5% of HCMC’s primary schoolchildren were either overweight or obese (Tuoi Tre, 2013).

High rates of obesity are driven by various socio-economic and environmental factors (Sahoo et al., 2015). Vietnam may be characterized as having a population with low levels of nutrition literacy while, at the same time, facing rapid changes in consumption and physical activity patterns. In particular, consumption of sugary drinks is high among schoolchildren in HCMC. 

The recent surge in obesity can have severe long-run repercussions. Overweight children are more likely to remain overweight as adults (Weiss et al. 2013). Obese adults are at increased risk of developing health conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. Taken together, childhood obesity may have important effects on an economy’s long-term productivity and economic development. In order to minimize future societal costs of obesity, prevention of childhood obesity should be a focus of policy actions, especially in countries where undernutrition is still a (costly) concern.
