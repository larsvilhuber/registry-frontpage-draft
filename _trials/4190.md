abstract: "Patients receiving HIV treatment need to visit health facilities frequently to obtain antiretroviral treatment (ART) refills and clinical care. At the facility, services are provided on a first-come first-serve basis and long waiting time is pervasive. This proposal aims to evaluate an appointment scheduling intervention for HIV patients receiving ART. This study will be randomized at the health facility level. Half of the study health facilities will be randomized to the scheduling intervention treatment group. In these facilities, all patients receiving HIV treatment will be given a scheduled appointment – with a return date and time – for their next visit. We will measure waiting time in all facilities during three rounds of data collection, and administrative data will be used to assess return visit delays up to one year after the start of the intervention.
