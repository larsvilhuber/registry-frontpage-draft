abstract: "While attitudes toward members of the LGBTQ+ community in the US have improved over the past few decades, there is mixed evidence concerning their socioeconomic status and labor market outcomes. This project focuses on pro-social attitudes towards LGBTQ+ members. These pro-social attitudes are important features that can have a crucial impact on individualsâ€™ wellbeing and productivity (e.g., in the workplace). Using a novel method to reveal the LGBTQ+ identities of members in an experimental setting, we examine whether individuals exhibit different pro-social attitudes towards members and non-members of the community. We also study whether individuals expect different pro-social attitudes towards non-heterosexual individuals. The findings from this project will form the basis of a broader research agenda on the economics of discrimination specific to LGBTQ+ individuals, and will contribute to debates on the appropriate policies to address discrimination against these individuals both in the workplace and the community at large."
