abstract: "Moral universalism is the extent to which people exhibit the same level of altruism and trust toward strangers as toward in-group members. In this study, we investigate what determines these behaviors. Based on a experimentally validated, survey-based measure of moral universalism (Enke et al. 2022), we explore socio-economic correlates and further explore the causal effect of the social environment by randomly enrolling children in a year-long mentoring program."
