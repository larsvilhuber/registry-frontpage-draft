abstract: "Discriminatory attitudes and practices towards foreigners within healthcare facilities have been increasingly reported in South Africa, including in instances where foreigners have the same legal rights to access free health care services as South African citizens. While the existence and consequences of discrimination against foreigners has been documented in the media and through qualitative studies, this problem has not been studied empirically in a systematic way. We employ an audit study to answer the following questions:

1) Do foreign patients face more administrative constraints than South African citizens to access healthcare services?
2) Do foreign patients face more derogatory or rude behaviours than South African in the healthcare sector?
3) Do foreign patients receive the same quality of care as South African citizens? 
4) Are there differences between the public and private sectors in the discrimination faced by foreign patients?

To answer these questions, we will use the random allocation of foreign enumerators to play the role of incognito standardised patients in a large audit study of the quality of healthcare services provided in a large urban metropole in South Africa. This design also allows for a between-subject analysis comparing differential behavior of healthcare professionals towards South African and foreign patients. The audit study will be followed by a short survey designed to record the providersâ€™ demographic and socio-economic characteristics, as well as beliefs about xenophobic discrimination and implicit bias against foreigners.
