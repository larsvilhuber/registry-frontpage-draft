abstract: "Many interventions aimed at improving students' reading skills have proven effective in small-scale evaluations. However, when educational interventions include more than a thousand students, effect sizes tend to approach zero. This problem of scalability is recognized in the literature, yet there exists very little systematic, research-based knowledge on how to solve it. 

The trial invites a randomly selected group of one third of all public schools in Denmark to participate in the shared-book reading program READit. The main goal is to improve the reading skills of students in the invited schools compared to all other schools in the country. Within the main trial, we embed trials testing how to increase sign-up within invited schools, how to support teachers in supporting families, and how to facilitate families' use of a digital reading platform."
