abstract: "Entrepreneurs face a range of obstacles in developing countries, including a low-skilled workforce and weak institutions. Moreover, for historical reasons, business legitimacy is low. In these contexts, new entrepreneurs seek to survive in hostile environments but often lack reputations. In this project, we explore the role of narratives as a dimension of business strategy in developing countries. Specifically, we ask whether narratives facilitate exchange. We test this hypothesis using a survey experiment that presents consumers with real and AI-generated online stores."
