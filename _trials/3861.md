abstract: "When faced with intertemporal trade-offs, many economic decision makers display a present bias, that is, their desire for immediate gratification leads them to become disproportionally more impatient when choices directly affect the present. Evidence for this comes, for example, from financial decision-making, exercising and effort provision, supporting the notion that intertemporal decision-making is often time-inconsistent. While the evidence for the existence of present bias is numerous, the question of how to interpret time-inconstistency in general and present bias in particular, from a welfare perspective remains open. In this project, we plan to shed light on this topic by investigating, through the means of a laboratory experiment, whether present bias should be treated as a true expression of preferences or as an error which should be avoided and (potentially) prevented by others through paternalistic actions.
