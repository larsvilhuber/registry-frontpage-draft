abstract: "We conduct a randomized laboratory experiment examining the effects of stress (implemented using four methods) on temporal discounting, effort provision, and executive control. Our study includes 1142 subjects from the informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. Respondents are randomly administered either a control or a treatment (stress) protocol, for seven consecutive days. This allows us to estimate the causal impacts of stress on decision-making after one and seven days of administration."
