abstract: "
There is evidence to suggest that public acceptability of health interventions is affected by how those interventions are framed (i.e. the way they are described and presented). In this study, we assess i) how the framing of the drivers of obesity, and ii) the framing of interventions as being delivered by the government, influences public perception of interventions to tackle overweight and obesity. We will explore these questions through an online randomized controlled trial; in which around 6000 participants will be randomized to one of 4 groups: (I) control (i.e. no framing, and no mention of government), (II) explanation of obesity as being caused by the environment, (III) explanation of obesity as being caused by industry, and (IV) government framed as implementing interventions to tackle obesity. Participants in each group will then be presented with a series of interventions to tackle obesity, and asked to rate how acceptable they find them and how effective they perceive them to be. Results will be compared across groups."
