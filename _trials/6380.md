abstract: "The Ticket to Work (TTW) program provides Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) beneficiaries and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients with disabilities with choices for receiving employment services while providing incentives to providers to serve these individuals.  The goal of the TTW legislation was to expand the availability of employment services for beneficiaries beyond the existing state vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies, reducing dependency on disability benefits. The TTW Notice Optimization project seeks to increase participation in the TTW program by developing an evidence-based approach to targeting outreach to eligible beneficiaries. The project will test changes to Ticket notices including the types of notices sent and the language used. The project aims to increase the number of beneficiaries who “assign a Ticket” with an Employment Network (EN) or VR agency. The assignment of a Ticket constitutes an agreement between the beneficiary and a service provider of their choice for employment support services. More intermediate goals of the project include an increase in initial calls to the TTW Help Line. The intervention is tested in a 2 x 2 factorial design where the re-designed letter constitutes factor #1 and an added cardstock Ticket factor #2. The intervention will run for 18 months, starting September 16, 2020, and outcomes will be measured at 9 months post-intervention for each individual."
