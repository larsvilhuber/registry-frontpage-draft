abstract: "This study explores consumer decision-making processes related to electricity saving through a comprehensive analysis integrating several theoretical frameworks and advanced modeling techniques. A Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) is employed to assess stated-preferences and predict choices across different electricity-saving measures. The Multinomial Logit Model (MNL) serves as the primary analytical tool, facilitating the estimation of choice probabilities based on observed characteristics. Additionally, a Latent Class Model (LCM) is utilized to uncover unobserved heterogeneity among respondents, identifying distinct segments with unique preference structures.

Theoretical underpinnings were drawn from the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Value-Belief-Norms (VBN) Theory, both of which provide insights into the motivational factors driving consumer behavior in the context of electricity conservation. TPB's focus on attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control is complemented by the VBN theory's emphasis on personal values and beliefs influencing norm activation and behavioral intentions.

Our main interest is to test whether making dynamic norms more salient helps to increase preferences for electricity-saving measures. Practically, we will conduct an experiment with a control group and two treatment groups: one where dynamic norms focus on increasing concerns about climate change, and another where dynamic norms focus on increasing concerns about the energy crisis. This dynamic perspective allows for an understanding of how evolving social influences can alter individual choices and preference stability."
