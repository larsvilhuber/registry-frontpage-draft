abstract: "A spare-time job may foster character skills in the same way as workplace-based programs that teach character skills. Therefore, a spare-time job may have non-pecuniary and cumulative benefits in the form of skill formation, especially behavioral or character skills that can be transferred for use in other domains of life, including schooling and education, i.e. life-skills.  We conduct a randomized controlled trial to test this hypothesis. Our intervention randomizes spare-time job search assistance from youth club workers to pupils in the 7th to 10th grade in lower-secondary school  who are at risk of not completing an upper secondary education and for whom it is difficult to find a spare-time job on their own.
