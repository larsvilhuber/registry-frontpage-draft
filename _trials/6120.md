abstract: "Financial inclusion and digitalization became an utter necessity for firms in order to survive the strict lockdowns derived from COVID-19 crisis around the world. In low and middle-income countries, micro-firms such as convenience store owners, hairdresser saloons, small shops and restaurants, among others are typically in a bad shape to face the new market conditions. This intervention targets these small firms in order to improve their capabilities to survive in the new normality. It uses a phone-based application (Expertiendia) designed to train and certify firm owners in the topics of: (i) business management, (ii) sales and marketing, (iii) customer service, (iv)  financial inclusion and literacy. We target firms located in 10 cities of Colombia, all of them in low and middle-income residential areas close to the campus of a major university."
