abstract: "We randomly select classes in elementary schools in a rural county in China and form small teams with five to six members within the classes as treatment groups. Students in the teams complete daily duty tasks, attendance checks, and counts of disruptive behaviors. They finish homework individually but hand in homework as a team throughout an entire semester. Students in control classes undertake the same tasks individually instead of as a team. Teachers provide reports on students' disruptive behaviors and performance on tasks in both types of classes. However, the report in treatment classes was based on the performance of the whole team. We compare the test scores and in-class discipline of students from both treatment classes and control classes. A follow-up survey will be conducted on teachers and students in treatment classes for their impression and comments on the experiment. "
