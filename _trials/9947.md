abstract: "We propose an RCT to study first whether a socio-emotional learning intervention can boost social cohesion in a group setting. In a second stage we seek to understand whether this increase in social cohesion can boost peer effects where students in the group learn more from peers with more knowledge. We will carry out this study in the setting of an online tutoring program in Mexico. Tutors meet with groups of 5 students twice a week for several months to revise math topics. Students are all of the same grade but from different schools and don't know each other in advance.

We will first randomly assign students to groups that will either be tracked or not tracked by initial performance. From the literature of tracking, we know that tracked groups tend to outperform non-tracked groups because tracking makes it easier for the teacher to teach at the right level at the expense of peer effects that can occur in diverse group settings. 

We will then randomly assign these groups to a socio-emotional learning intervention (SEL) or a control condition. In the SEL intervention, tutors will use 10 hours of class to revise SEL activities instead of mathematics. To keep the time spent with the tutor constant, tutors in the control condition will use 10 hours of class to revise Mexican history topics. From previous pilots, we expect that the SEL condition will boost group cohesion as well as the attachment of students to the tutor. 

Among educators it is well discussed that building rapport between teachers and students is a  key ingredient of learning but and this study can document the importance of rapport quantitatively. We expect groups under the SEL intervention to perform better. We also expect groups in the tracking condition to perform better than in the non-tracked condition and we are interested in the interaction between the SEL treatment and the non-tracked groups as we think that peer effects might be boosted in groups with a strong social cohesion. 

We are also interested to document the a priori preferences of children to be in a tracked or non-tracked group. We will ask students before assignments whether they would rather be in a tracked or non-tracked group then we will look for heterogeneous treatment effects between both groups. Students may have private information of whether they will reap the benefits of tracking and we would be able to measure these benefits. 

We are also interested in studying heterogeneous treatment effects by initial performance as peer effects will go in different directions whenever the student outperforms or underperforms their peers.
