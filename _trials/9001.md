abstract: "We will run a lab experiment, where human traders can trade multiple units of an asset in a double auction. Some time during trading, a public news release shifts the asset value either up ("good news") or down ("bad news"). Trade is possible before, during, or after news release. There are two types of traders, one type values the asset more by 10 ECUs than the other type, for any realization of the asset value. Hence, this is a private value setting, and there are gains from trade. All traders are initially endowed with multiple units of the asset and with cash.

We have three main treatments: Control, with only human traders. MO-Algo, where an algorithm that only uses market orders is active. LO-Algo, where an algorithm that only uses limit orders is active. In the algo treatments, the trading algorithm replaces a human trader from the control treatment, so the endowments and number of traders in the market remain constant.

Within treatments, we vary whether the public news release happens at a fixed and known point in time (e.g., in the middle of the trading window), or whether the news release happens some time in a time window (but the traders do not know the exact time until it happens)."
