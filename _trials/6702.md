abstract: "We designed a randomized field experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of monetary incentives to promote recycling. We can observe individual real time data on bio-waste recycling thanks to the introduction of a system of electronic bins in a Spanish densely populated city. We exploit these data to evaluate the impact of monetary prizes on the incentives to participate in recycling programs. The field-intervention is implemented by a team of environmental educators who has direct interaction with citizens. 

In the control group, the probability of winning a monetary prize will be independent of the number of uses of the bio-waste bin. In the treatment group, the probability of winning the prize will depend on the number of weeks that the household has made at least one use of the bin per week. In this way, one group receives economic incentives to recycle while the other does not."
