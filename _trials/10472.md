abstract: "The number of refugees is rapidly increasing worldwide, and this trend is expected to continue. Humanitarian aid organisations increasingly use cash transfers to help recipients regain control of their lives. While a recent pilot program in Uganda documented that cash transfers improved refugees’ short-run quality of life, they did not encourage savings and investments, failing to strengthen refugees’ long-term self-reliance. This is consistent with the view that poverty is multifaceted, and that merely relaxing the financial constraint is not sufficient to escape poverty. 

We collaborate with a humanitarian NGO to develop and test the effectiveness of innovative, low-cost, and scalable interventions aimed at increasing the impact of cash transfers on self-reliance, via a Randomized Controlled Trial among 861 refugee households (~5300 refugees) in Uganda.
