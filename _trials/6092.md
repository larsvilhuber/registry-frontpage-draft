abstract: "Globally, gender-related barriers to economic growth persist. Social norms and family roles traditionally attached to women undermine their labor force participation and income generating capacity. This study tries to identify strategies to economically empower women in developing countries with high levels of self-employment. Previous studies assumed that knowledge constraints limit the growth of female-led businesses and have thus focused on providing hard-skills training for the entrepreneurial activity with very limited success. Recognizing that not all women enter the entrepreneurial activity due to the same intrinsic reasons, we explore the effect of training programs that foster the development of women's hard and soft skills both for the entrepreneurial activity and the insertion/reinsertion into the labor market. We evaluate three alternative programs delivering: (i) hard skills to better run a business (ii) hard and soft skills business training and (iii) soft skills to enter the labor market."
