abstract: "We conduct an in-person, incentive compatible survey experiment with a nationally representative sample of Mexican households. Participants in the treatment group receive an informational intervention designed to update their beliefs about the incidence of suicide ideation and attempts within the LGBT+ population. The experiment elicits beliefs about suicide in the general population and within other minority groups, as well as beliefs about the causes of suicide, and trust in the sources of information. The main outcome is support for policies in favor of the LGBT+ population."
