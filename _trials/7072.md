abstract: "Researchers have documented gender gaps in many labor market outcomes, such as hiring and admission decisions or the evaluation of performance. This study aims at understanding the role of gender biases among interviewers as potential drivers of gender gaps in hiring outcomes. Moreover, we plan to analyze the impact of a ‘bias awareness’ intervention that aims at reducing the gender gap in the assessment of candidates applying to a large company. "
