abstract: "We study the role of the candidates' gender as a cue for voting in the United States in a low-informational setting. In this setting, voters can observe candidates' gender from headshots but have no additional information about the candidates. Our conjecture is that 
(a) Democrats of either gender are more likely to vote for women than Republicans of the same gender 
(b) those supporting Biden of either gender are more likely to vote for a female candidate than those supporting Trump of the same gender
(c) men tend to support male candidates more often than women 
(d) women tend to support female candidates more often than men.
Additionally, we study how confident respondents are in their choices in experimental elections, as well as to what extent respondent confidence in their choice depends on the appearance gap between the two candidates. In this respect, our conjectures are:
(e) Republicans are, on average, more certain in their choice than Democrats,
(f) Trump supporters are, on average, more certain in their choice than Biden supporters,
(g) Republicans are, on average, more likely to choose better-looking candidates than Democrats,
(h) Trump supporters are, on average, more likely to choose better-looking candidate than Biden supporters,
â€¦at least when it comes to choices between two candidates of the same gender."
