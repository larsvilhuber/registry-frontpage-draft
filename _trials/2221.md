abstract: "We investigate the effects of an energy management training designed to identify both technology and process-oriented energy-saving opportunities for firms in a machine components manufacturing cluster in Shandong Province, China. We aim to understand to what extent, and through what mechanisms, the intervention affects firms' energy management practices and ultimately improves their efficiency of energy use. We are interested in studying the relationship between measures of good management practices and the adoption of experts' recommendations. Our study will also allow us to qualitatively probe the role of management and other firm characteristics, such as firm size, degree of centralization, and appointment of a dedicated energy manager, on achievement of energy savings through a set of pre- and post-intervention survey questions. The training is conducted by a team of local and international energy saving experts with expertise in the metalworking equipment and production processes employed by the firms in our sample. For each firm, experts generate a customized list of improvements and deliver their findings to the firms in the form of a report. A representative of the team follows up every three months to assess progress and elaborate or adjust recommendations.
