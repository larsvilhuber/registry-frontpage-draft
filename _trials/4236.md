abstract: "We seek to research willingness to exert effort under recurring and persistent temptation. In particular, we want to study the potential depletion of willpower by varying the frequency of opportunity to quit.  By varying the frequency of this temptation, we are able to capture whether not refusing a temptation is indeed reducing a limited pool of willpower, or if it is the actual task itself that reduces willpower, or if neither have an effect on quitting behavior.  We conduct a laboratory experiment to try and answer this question.  In addition, we vary piece rates and payment delay to observe how these may have a role on the ability to refuse temptation to quit.  For example, if the reward (payment) is closer in time, does the opportunity to quit instead serve as a reminder of their benefits and encourage persistence?  Vs a reward much later, where opportunities to quit are merely reminders of the cost of effort?
