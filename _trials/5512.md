abstract: "Previous studies have shown that behavioral nudges can be a cost-effective tool to influence changes in peopleâ€™s actions. In this study, we aim to test whether nudging court managers through informing them on how their court performs in absolute and relative terms can improve court productivity. Moreover, we test if there is any difference if the information about the court performance is given in contrast and relation to self past performance or if the information is relative to other courts' performance.
