abstract: "In an online experiment, we study the influence of a prior opt-out option and digital money on the prevalence of bank runs. Subjects in the experiment make two main decisions. First, they decide whether or not to enter a risky investment game. Subjects who enter the investment game then decide whether to continue investing their money or withdraw it. Continued investment leads to higher payoffs than withdrawal if and only if all subjects in a group continue to invest. Between treatments we vary whether payouts happen in the form of cash, digital money or both. We also have additional treatments that dispense of the first decision i.e. where subjects do not have an opt-out decision and enter the investment game automatically. We hypothesise three main effects: Firstly, we expect less continued investment (i.e. more bank runs) in treatments where subjects have no prior opt-out option. Secondly, we expect a higher number of bank runs in treatments where digital money is available due to a higher perceived risk of withdrawal of digital money. Thirdly, we expect an interaction effect between the availability of an opt-out option and the existence of digital money, such that when there is no opt-out option and digital money exists bank runs are particularly prevalent.
