abstract: "In this paper, we study contract enforcement in the illegal gambling market of Pakistan as gamblers make high-stakes betting decisions without the state enforcing contracts. Our experimental intervention randomly assigns gamblers into four different contracts: (i) the most common, status quo contract that stipulates spot betting with the pay back the week after (ii) Blacklisting contract that imposes a local or global reputational cost in case of nonpayment (iii) Payment deadline extension treatment that provides a weekâ€™s extension to pay back the lost money i.e. pay back deadline in 14 days instead of 7 days; Finally, a (iv) decision aid group where we do not offer any contract but accept the status-quo 7 day pay back contract if the bettor explicitly requests this contract, within this treatment arm,  the gambler also receives a decision aid notebook containing odds and historical data relevant to the bet. We pre-register three field outcomes and four strategic dilemmas.  The field measures include (a) amount bet, (b) won and lost amount (c) payback amount. The behavioral data are collected for the following for games: (a) risk, (b) confidence, (c) cooperation and (d) coordination."
