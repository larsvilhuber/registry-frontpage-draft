abstract: "While the digital revolution has greatly enhanced access to information for millions, it has simultaneously allowed unscrupulous state and non-state actors to spread misinformation online. Youth are particularly vulnerable to misinformation online or ‘fake news’.  Even though they are digital natives, recent research shows that a majority of them cannot distinguish between “sponsored content” and real news. A lack of ability to evaluate information and news online (digital literacy skills) among youth puts them at risk of being misled—this can have adverse impacts on societies worldwide. Previous digital literacy interventions have mostly made students skeptical of all news, rather than discerning news consumers. Considering this global threat—and previous efforts to address digital literacy—we explore strategies that improve digital literacy skills. Specifically, we test the effectiveness of various programs designed to improve digital literacy skills by conducting a large-scale randomized controlled trial with approximately 5,000 low and middle-income youth in 400 classrooms in India. The study thus hopes to shed light on means to help youth navigate information in the digital age and, in the process, strengthen society by ensuring that future citizens can identify trustworthy information about social and political issues."
