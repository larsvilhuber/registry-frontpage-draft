abstract: "How do risk preferences influence the speed and character of social learning? I consider this question with theoretical modeling and a laboratory experiment. In the theoretical model, I generalize the information cascade settings (Banerjee, 1992; Bikhchandani et al., 1992), assuming that agents differ in risk preferences and choose between asymmetrically risky options. In the laboratory experiment, I compare the herding decisions of agents in settings with symmetrically and asymmetrically risky options. Preliminary results of the model and the pilot experiment show that heterogeneity of agentsâ€™ risk preferences may slow down convergence speed and change the probability of convergence to different options."
