abstract: "Pneumonia and diarrhea continue to be primary causes of death among children under five, accounting for 30% of child mortality in Kenya alone. Research has demonstrated that handwashing with soap prevents pneumonia and diarrhea, but lack of soap provisions and limited piped water infrastructure makes handwashing practices difficult. To make the process of handwashing more convenient, Innovations for Poverty Action has redesigned an existing tippy-tap handwashing system to create a more functional, durable, and innovative handwashing system. The result is a water-efficient, soap-frugal handwashing station that is portable and adaptable to multiple settings. The innovative soap foam dispenser conserves soap by dispensing tactile foam and the water tap is easy to use and conserves water.

This study will assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the redesigned handwashing system when coupled with a handwashing behavioral intervention in peri-urban primary schools in Kisumu, Kenya. Using a cluster-randomized trial approach that incorporates a stepped wedge design, the study seeks to understand usage and maintenance practices related the handwashing stations in primary schools in comparison to existing handwashing practices.
