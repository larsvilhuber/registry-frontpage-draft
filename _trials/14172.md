abstract: "In this study, we investigate the impact of new information technologies on American voters' political knowledge through a two-wave online survey experiment. We developed BallotBot, an interactive chatbot powered by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) trained to provide official information about statewide ballot measures. A random sample of California voters is assigned to either use BallotBot or the digital version of the official voter guide to answer questions about upcoming ballot initiatives. We want to compare participants' short- and medium-term political knowledge, as well as the perceived and objective costs of acquiring that knowledge, across the two experimental groups. Additionally, we collect data on voting intentions, turnout behavior, and the reasoning behind participants' vote choices to assess how these factors differ between the groups."
