abstract: "Educational television has shown promise for bridging educational gaps in classrooms in developing countries. However, there is less evidence on its effectiveness in a home viewing setting when the show is transmitted free over-the-air, an approach of interest to policymakers because of its scalability and low cost. We are conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of watching a new educational television program at home. The new show is broadcasted on a free over-the-air television channel in Kenya. Besides instructional content, a key innovation of the show is its objective to change children's mindsets about reading, gender attitudes and socio-emotional learning. We recruited 4,300 children in 346 public schools. We employ a randomized SMS-based encouragement design, sending bi-weekly reminders encouraging parents to have their children watch episodes of a new educational show at home.  "
