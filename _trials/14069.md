abstract: "Our study seeks to understand individuals' preferences for spreading polarizing content on an information platform, which is essential to inform the design of effective platform governance strategies. It is important to discern whether individuals' propensity to spread polarizing content is due to biased beliefs about the impact of their actions or an inherent (dis)taste to incite division among a group. However, disentangling beliefs from preferences is an empirically challenging task, which requires a controlled setting that can causally identify the effects of these channels on actual behavior. To address this, we will conduct an online experiment to measure whether manipulating the salience and varying the degree of polarization consequences can shape individuals' content-sharing behavior."
