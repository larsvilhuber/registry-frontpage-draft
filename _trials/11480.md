abstract: "There is widespread concern about the reported global democratic decline and its implications for economic growth. A critical factor that may determine the future of democracy is voter understanding and engagement in improving the quality of democratic institutions. However, it remains unclear how voters assess these institutions and if they have a shared view of which political parties uphold them. This study aims to evaluate the effect of credible information about democratic institutions on voter behavior and beliefs in Turkey using a large-scale experimental information campaign, electoral data, and survey data."
