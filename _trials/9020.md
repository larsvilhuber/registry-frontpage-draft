abstract: "We investigate how targeted subsidies and information campaigns for long-acting injectable contraception (Sayana Press) and provider incentives impact initial uptake of Sayana Press, pricing and stocking decisions for contraceptive products in local markets, and sales. Following prior work on the effectiveness of subsidies to promote the adoption of new technologies and experience goods, we aim to test if subsidies lead to the adoption of Sayana Press as well as to study possible mechanisms such as learning, price channels, and information effects. We use a cluster randomized controlled trial in a network of independent pharmacies. Patient subsidies and pharmacist incentives will be randomized and compared against the status quo to evaluate their effectiveness in promoting adoption.
