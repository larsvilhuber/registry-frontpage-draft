abstract: "This study tests completely self-funded deposit commitment contracts for exercising. We also aim to explore the role of individuals' health-related behaviour on health inequality. In addition to exercise, we look at several outcomes, such as sleep and other stress-related variables. For this study, we have designed a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to be carried out in the field in collaboration with Friskis & Svettis (F&S) Uppsala in Sweden. F&S is a not-for-profit sports club, with classes and gyms. F&S Uppsala has facilities at three locations in Uppsala, and approximately 28,000 members."
