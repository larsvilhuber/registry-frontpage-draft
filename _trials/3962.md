abstract: "We collaborate with several brokerage houses in Dhaka stock market to obtain daily trading data of more than 350 retail stock market traders/investors and conduct a stock market short course training among them. The intervention includes a short course training for the traders. We use lab-in-the-field experiments to examine other behavioural channels such as myopic loss aversion, ambiguity, risk and time preference of these investors. Finally, we combine the knowledge test and experiment results with a unique dataset on daily transactions and portfolio positions of these traders over two years to study the link between individual investment decision under controlled experiment setting and their natural domain.
