abstract: "The recent Venezuelan migration crisis has seen over 3 million people move to other Latin-American countries. Even though Uruguay has been the recipient of only a small fraction of them, the number of Venezuelan migrants has been steadily and significantly increasing since 2014. Though the general climate is not of overt xenophobia in the general population, there is still signs of dissatisfaction from some Uruguayans considering that the newcomers are taking relatively low-skilled jobs in an economy with increasing unemployment rates.

In this project, we conduct a lab experiment to examine differences in trust levels towards immigrants, and whether allowing for prior free-form communication can help diminish any such differences."
