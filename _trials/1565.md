abstract: "We test efficacy of technology training on labor market outcomes in developing countries around the world.  Specifically, we ask if and to what extent coding bootcamps impact the employability and salary levels of young people in developing countries.  To answer, we run an experiment presented  to  potential  participants  as  a  six  months long study on income and employment. We offer incentives for completing an intake survey and  two  follow-up  surveys.  As  a “bonus,”  participants  are  be  entered  into  a  lottery  for  a reduced-cost  bootcamp.  By  following  this  structure,  all  enrolled  participants  agree to participate in the research regardless of whether or  not  they  participate in the  bootcamp.  This  ensures that  we obtain  data  from  individuals regardless of whether they participate in the bootcamps, while also achieving randomization."
