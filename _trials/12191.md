abstract: "In this study we aim to investigate the efficacy of non-monetary incentives, specifically public recognition, in stimulating Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB) among employees. Our study explores how non-monetary recognition influences employeesâ€™ willingness to engage in behaviors that are beneficial but not contractually required, such as assisting colleagues and participating in work-related events. We posit that public recognition by management can signal the value of OCB to both the firm and peers, thereby fostering a culture of cooperation and mutual support.To test our hypothesis, we will implement a controlled intervention in a corporate setting, where a subset of employees will receive a symbolic certificate of recognition for displaying OCB. We will measure the impact of this recognition on various indicators of employee engagement and organizational effectiveness. "
