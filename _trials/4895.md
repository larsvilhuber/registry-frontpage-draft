abstract: "We evaluate the causal impact of large-scale extension demonstration activities on adoption of a new technology, a hermetic (airtight) grain storage bag, using a cluster-randomized trial in 48 villages among 1,200 smallholder maize and legume producers across Uganda. We find that two seasons post-intervention, the technology increased adoption propensity in treatment villages by 3.4 percentage points. This increase was larger and significant (nearly 17-percentage points) among households in treatment clusters who self-selected to participate in the extension activities."
