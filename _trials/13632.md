abstract: "In Uganda, where financial challenges disproportionately affect women, our study aims to make a difference by enhancing financial literacy and entrepreneurial aspirations through innovative methods. We are conducting a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of two specific interventions: a mobile game designed to improve financial knowledge and decision-making, and an inspirational documentary aimed at boosting the entrepreneurial drive among women participating in the FINCA community bank program. This study explores whether these interactive and engaging tools can help women become more financially independent and successful in their business ventures. By examining the effects of these interventions alone and together, we hope to understand better how learning and motivation can lead to economic empowerment. The findings from this research will contribute to the ongoing efforts by the Ugandan government and various stakeholders, including the Central Bank of Uganda and international organizations, to promote financial inclusion and empowerment among women."
