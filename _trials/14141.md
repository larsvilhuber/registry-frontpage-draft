abstract: "This research aims to estimate the price elasticity of demand for electric cooking in rural areas. We also aim to identify the degree of substitution away from traditional solid fuels when electric cooking is accessible. How do the cooking behavior and patterns change when households use electric stoves? What is the impact of electric stoves on household air pollution, and what are time-saving effects for women? self-reported health measures, and well-being?"
