abstract: "Willingness to lead is not homogeneously distributed in the population. There is extensive research on the attributes of a good leader, and on how willingness to lead impacts leadership. But not a lot of research focuses on those who do not want to lead, the reasons why they do not put themselves forward, and if they would actually be better leaders than those who do not want to lead.
I want to study the personality traits of those who do not want to lead, and if they would make different decisions for others than those who seek power. More precisely, I focus on distribution preference, i.e. the trade-off between efficiency (sum of individual payoffs), equality, and maximin (maximisation of the smallest payoff). Do individuals who do not want to lead take more equal or efficient decisions?
