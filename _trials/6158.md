abstract: "We provide evidence on the impact of the Youth Opportunities Program (YOP) on resilience against the COVID-19 shock. Our sample consists of 2,700 youth in northern Uganda that are part of a randomized controlled trial of YOP in 2008. The YOP program was initiated by the Ugandan government in 2006 and invited groups of young adults, aged between 16 and 35, to apply for the YOP program. The groups submitted proposals for grants of roughly $8,000 (or $400 per person) for starting individual skilled trades. Two previous studies show substantial effects on earnings after four years and lasting effects on assets, skilled labor, and whether recipients effectively owned their business after 9 years.  Using phone survey data, we will estimate whether YOP beneficiaries are more resilient to the global pandemic and consequent economic shutdown. Our main research question is whether a cash-based employment program affects the long-term resilience of households to deal with an aggregate shock such as the COVID-19 lockdown. Our primary outcomes will be employment, income, and food security. "
