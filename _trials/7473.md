abstract: "A successful entrepreneurial ecosystem (EE) shows a strong culture of support for entrepreneurship expressed through culture, leadership and and social networks (Stam & van de Ven 2021). We assess entrepreneursâ€™ willingness to support different levels of start-up ecosystems through a factorial cluster trial in the field. We hypothesize that entrepreneurs are more willing to support their more local EE; that this willingness varies with EE; and that a common industry also plays a role. We plan to contribute to research by providing an additional quantitative measure of the quality of an EE and by identifying an additional lever for policy to increase start-up activity and economic growth.
