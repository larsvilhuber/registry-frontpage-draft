abstract: "This trial is based on a population-representative sample of 3–6-year-old Danish children from 154 preschools centers. The centers participated in a cluster-randomized evaluation of three variations of a language-literacy focused curriculum, LEAP (Language Education Activities for Preschoolers) comprising 40 twice-weekly 30-min lessons. Prior to the intervention, educators from the treatment institutions were trained for two days. The intervention aimed at investigating the effects associated with two components commonly seen in systematic explicit language and literacy interventions - group size and scripted lessons with aligned activities – on child outcomes when implemented at scale in a Danish preschool setting.
