abstract: "Background: Cancer is a serious illness that leads patients to be involved in emotional and psychological distress (Linden et al., 2012). Cancer management can have a significant impact on a patient's daily functioning and quality of life, leading to added stress and further deterioration in their mental health (Rhoten et al., 2013; Taghian et al., 2014 â€œChemotherapy refers to the use of any drug to treat any disease. But to most people, the word chemotherapy (or "chemo") means drugs used for cancer treatment.).Aim of the study: The main purpose of this study will be to examine the effect of Augmented Virtual Reality (AVR) on pain, stress, anxiety, and self-efficacy among adult cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy sessions in the West Bank hospitals in Palestine. Method: The design will be randomized control trial RCT design including a pretest and posttest to find a cause-and-effect association between an independent and dependent variable with 150 participants. . The participants will divided into two groups, the intervention group, which receives augmented virtual reality therapy, and the control group, which receives standard treatment. The study will use a pretest and posttest design to assess the effect of augmented virtual reality therapy on psychological outcomes, including stress, anxiety, pain, and self-efficacy. By comparing the psychological outcomes of the two groups, the study will be able to determine the effect of augmented virtual reality therapy on these outcomes and provide insights into its effectiveness as a therapeutic intervention.
