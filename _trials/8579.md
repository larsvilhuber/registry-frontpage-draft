abstract: "Ahlan Simsim is a television show developed by Sesame Workshop to specifically target the social and emotional development needs of 5-6-year-old children exposed, directly or indirectly, to displacement. Considering the Jordanian context, the series has been developed with the Syrian refugee crisis in mind. These important social and emotional development skills, when developed early in life, help children successfully navigate multiple social contexts, productively integrate into society, and bolster their opportunity to take advantage of other social, cognitive, and academic opportunities. As part of the ~12-week intervention, 108 KG2 (kindergarten) schools in the regions of Irbid, Balqa and Karak will be exposed to Ahlan Simsim, and another 108 will be exposed to the Kindergarten-2 (KG2) Curriculum designed by the Ministry of Education of Jordan. To prevent the diffusion of the intervention across multiple classrooms of a single school, we will only work with one randomly selected classroom per school. Only the intervention group will watch 26 episodes of 25 minutes each of video episodes of Ahlan Simsim (one per preschool day). We will estimate causal effects of Ahlan Simsim on targeted social and emotional child outcomes. With these estimations, we attempt to answer the following research questions: 

•	What is the impact of viewing Ahlan Simsim on children’s emotion recognition, identification, and vocabulary, as well as on their self-regulation strategies?
•	Are there children that benefit more than others from watching Ahlan Simsim (as defined by ethnic/immigrant-origin background; gender; age)?

A direct comparison of the average development of children in each group will answer the first question. An exploration of potential heterogeneity in these effects associated with individual, classroom, and setting level-characteristics will address the second question. "
