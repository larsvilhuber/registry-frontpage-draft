abstract: "Appearance matters in job-market outcomes (Mobius, 2006). Moreover, in low-income countries, overweight is associated with wealth, and perceived higher productivity. In this project, we investigate if individuals prefer to show a manipulated, higher body mass picture on their LinkedIn profile in the context of a LinkedIn workshop at the Makerere university in Kampala. We follow up with the participants to check if a month later the chosen picture is still their profile picture. "
