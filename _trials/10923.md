abstract: "Memorials are used world over to commemorate historical events. Among these are those dedicated to reminders of colonialism, slavery, wars, and genocide. There is growing interest in understanding how the presence of such memorials shape societal thinking,  integration, beliefs, and values. However, there is hardly any evidence. This progress has been hampered by several challenges. First, there is an issue of self-selection, as individual may sort into places with and without memorials. Second, even if we can resolve this problem, it is difficult to understand the underlying channel -- are observed responses due to internalization of beliefs and values or do they reflect social desirability. We aim to study the effect of memorials dedicated to the victims of WW-II on inclusive-decision making in Germany. These memorials are placed on municipal properties outside the house where the victims of WW II once lived. They include information on the name, gender, and age of the victim, as well as their survival status during the war period, and in case of death, the name and location of the concentration camp. "
