abstract: "Jobs in the garmenting industry are often seen as a potential pathway out of poverty for low-skill workers in developing countries, not least because they provide a stable income. The ability of workers to translate this stable income into welfare gains, however, depends on their ability to make financial decisions that are in their own short- and long-term interests. In this study, I work with women who start a job in a large industrial park outside Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. I design an intervention with the goal of helping them plan their finances, track their income and consumption, and follow through on self-set financial goals. Theoretically, the plan can be seen as a cognitive rule that relies on self-monitoring. I cross-randomize a light-touch information intervention designed to make workers "sophisticated" regarding their time preferences. Ultimately, I hope to improve workers' confidence in their own ability to manage their finances and their exercise of self-control. I primarily plan to analyze the intent-to-treat effects of these interventions (and their interaction) on individual consumption and savings decisions. I also plan to study measures of self-confidence that would speak to a theoretical framework in which workers' confidence in their own willpower may increase as a result of following the plan. As a secondary set of outcomes, I plan to use the longitudinal structure of the data to examine the relationship of economic circumstances, stress and affective states, and time preferences."
