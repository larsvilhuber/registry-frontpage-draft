abstract: "Many talented youths donâ€™t realize their potential due to various barriers. This research project aims to find ways to identify and nurture talent in the context of mathematics, by running a randomized controlled trial combining virtual training (an intensive 4-month-long course delivered by a state-of-the-art education provider) with small cash grants as an incentive. We work with national mathematics organizations in a dozen developing countries to recruit top scorers in national intermediate mathematics competitions for the project. We then investigate whether the training enables individuals to further develop their talent. Meanwhile, the cash prizes provide incentives to engage with the training fully, and they also recognize and empower individuals. Our primary endpoint is learning as measured by the performance on a dedicated math test.
