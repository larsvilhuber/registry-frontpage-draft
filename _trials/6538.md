abstract: "Digitization of higher education is fundamentally changing students’ academic experience and their learning process. Traditional live lectures are increasingly being replaced with online lectures. We conduct a field experiment at a major research university where students are randomly assigned to live lectures versus watching these exact same lectures online. We estimate whether assignment to online lecture affects students’ exam performance and academic experience. "
