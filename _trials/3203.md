abstract: "RFL is a 12-week program designed to cultivate virtuous character development and education, restoration, remediation, community service and affiliation in low-risk offenders who are referred to it by their county system. In previous research, we demonstrated in Saint Joseph County, the RFL program generated large and statistically significant drops in future arrests. Those assigned to the RFL treatment group had a 63 percent reduction (statistically significant at the 0.01 level) in the probability of being prosecuted for an offense of any type within two years of completing RFL. The program was successful at also reducing the recidivism of more serious offenses for those groups with the highest propensity for future offenses - prosecuted felonies fell by 50 percent over the control group mean (statistically significant at the .05 level) (Seroczynski, Evans, Jobst, Horvath, & Carozza, 2016). This study will evaluate the program at two new sites: Clark County, Ohio; and Madison County, Indiana."
