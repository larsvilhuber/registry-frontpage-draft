abstract: "Public support is vital to the space industry because the sector still receives about one-third of its funding from governmental budgets. Therefore, research and the media have extensively investigated and debated citizens’ opinions toward space expenditures. Various factors, for example, the overestimation of the actual space budget and sociodemographic characteristics have been identified as relevant determinants of public support for space funding. Existing research is insufficient for two reasons. First, research is primarily concerned with the public opinion toward government space agencies. With the emergence of the new space industry, this approach is no longer valid, as public support might change depending on whether a governmental agency or a private company receives funding. Second, while literature primarily focuses on the United States (U.S.), other nations have taken on significant roles in space exploration as well. We extend existing literature by analyzing nine leading space nations and considering the impact of the new space industry on the public opinion of space expenditures. We will investigate the public opinion of space funding and the effectiveness of different communications strategies using statistical hypotheses testing and regression analysis. Our data will be extracted from an online experiment with over 2000 citizens."
