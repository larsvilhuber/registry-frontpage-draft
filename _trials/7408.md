abstract: "We randomly assign three distinct invitations to participate in a survey. Each invitation is hypothesized to trigger a particular  form of motivation with the potential respondents. The overall aim is to test (a) whether these subtle differences in the invitation to participate (a) affect response rates, and (b) shape the sample due to self-selection and. Moreover, we embed a separate survey experiment in the survey and test whether the three different invitations lead to treatment heterogeneity.
