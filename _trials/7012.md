abstract: "Residential electricity consumption in developing countries has risen, and is predicted to increase steadily in the near future. At the same time, groundwater extraction for agriculture is often fueled by electricity, and will likely rise over time as pumps become more affordable for small-scale farmers. For instance, agricultural electricity connections in Bangladesh have risen from 5,549 in 1981 to 54,592 in 2015. Much of the energy-efficiency literature has focused on residential or commercial users of electricity. Is there room to increase energy efficiency among agricultural users? We consider this by testing different mechanisms to encourage adoption of electricity-saving irrigation technology in Bangladesh. To our knowledge, there are very few studies that look at energy efficiency in agriculture, specifically on strategies that encourage farmers to adopt technology that uses electricity more efficiently. The experiment will estimate the energy savings from Alternate Wetting and Drying --- a technique where farmers use a plastic PVC pipe to monitor soil moisture and plan irrigations. We will compare the savings from two different targeting strategies. First, we will offer the technology to water sellers, who stand to gain from saving electricity since they charge farmers for water on a seasonal basis and pay for the marginal cost of pumping on their own. Second, we will offer the technology directly to farmers. "
