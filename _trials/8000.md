abstract: "Many students in developing countries still lag behind their grade in learning. One strategy to motivate student effort and achievement that has received considerable attention is providing short-term monetary or non-monetary incentives at the individual level. In our project, we seek to study whether the provision of non-monetary incentives at the classroom level might be more effective and inclusive for pupils. Non-monetary incentives are low cost and uncontroversial with potentially large effects on learning outcomes.
