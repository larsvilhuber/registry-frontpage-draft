abstract: "We study how economic uncertainty affects the investment and hiring plans of firms. We run a large-scale survey among German firms. The survey is in the context of the current Covid-19 crisis and we use the case of Covid-19 induced uncertainty to investigate the relationship between uncertainty and investments. To capture firm’s priors, we first elicit their expectations regarding the economic recovery and how uncertain the (extent and length) of the recovery is to them. Economic uncertainty is then exogenously manipulated through a randomized survey experiment. Respondents in an uncertainty treatment are presented the information that the council of economic experts of the German government has calculated several scenarios (either optimistic or pessimistic) for the economic recovery and that it remains unclear which of the scenarios will realize. The treatment information is presented verbally and graphically where the graphical illustration depicts the economic growth rates for the different scenarios (which are either optimistic or pessimistic). As benchmarks, we have further treatment arms that are either presented no information (control group) or “certainty treatments” which present either the optimistic or pessimistic scenario. After the experiment, we elicit uncertainty again (through a different question than before the experiment). We then have a set of questions which will be used as the outcome variables in our analysis: firms’ plans to invest in the short and medium run as well as their hiring plans in the short and medium run. Overall, our research paper aims to contribute to the literature on the relationship between uncertainty and investments (e.g., Baker, Bloom and Davis, 2016) through exploiting randomized variation in uncertainty in a survey among firms. In addition, we aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of the implications of the current Covid-19 crisis on firm behavior. "
