abstract: "We study the role of organizational prestige in fostering workers' learning. In a field study, we hire around 400/600 workers who are alumni or students of different high-education institutions to evaluate the performance of seller executives. In an online evaluation platform, workers listen to executives' recorded conversations to predict the executive's success rate. To test for the role of organizational prestige in learning, we measure how workers' predictions change as they are informed about predictions of other people who belong to their own, a higher, and lower prestige institution. In the control, workers are informed of an average prediction without referencing any institution. To test for the moderating effect of incentives, we randomize a small monetary bonus for the prediction accuracy across the prestige treatments."
