abstract: "Recent technological developments enable online job platforms to match workers to employers not only across oceans but also across traffic-riddled cities. In Indonesia today, more than one million workers in both urban and rural areas are engaged in online labor markets across a range of domestic and international platforms. This pilot study to investigate whether online jobs can substitute for geographic mobility by allowing individuals to compete and work in virtual job markets. "
