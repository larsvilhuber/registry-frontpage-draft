abstract: "Rigid gender norms of home production and caregiving have deterred female labor force participation (FLFP) and women’s economic autonomy and are major causes of intimate partner violence and mental health issues, especially among women and girls. Women’s social and economic exclusion is a global problem with drastic repercussions evident in developing economies, especially in India, where since 2005, FLFP is on a steady decline and indicators of gender inequality are higher than in comparable economies. In this context, this study using a randomized control trial will attempt to examine if providing relationship counseling to couples on gender equality, stereotype, discrimination, trust, and cooperation could reduce gender inequality in labor force participation and unpaid work, affect social and economic decision-making by men and women, and improve overall household welfare. In addition, we seek to examine if relationship counseling could improve the self-efficacy and self-esteem of women and children in the household. The treatment is divided into two arms, first, we examine the impact of informational relationship counseling, and in the second arm, in addition to the relationship counseling, couples will carry out activities and play games, related to social and economic issues around gender, with community members in order to assess if ‘learning by doing' has an additional effect on the outcomes of interest. The study will draw the attention of policymakers to the relative lack of relationship counseling in developing economies and potentially highlight its significance."
