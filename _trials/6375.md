abstract: "Climate change is one of the most important challenges of this century. International coordination on climate goals requires countries to have sufficient domestic support to make ambitious pledges and turn them into policies. Increasing climate literacy and people’s understanding of policies aimed at tackling climate change is crucial. Several jurisdictions are currently planning to teach climate change in schools in a systematic way. At the moment, however, very little is known about the effects of educating school-age youths about climate change and climate policy, and whether and how their knowledge is transferred to their families (parents). This project aims at filling these gaps. It leverages the unique context of Italy, the first country in the world to bring climate change to the classroom in a systematic fashion starting from the school year 2020-2021. We test for the first time the effect of educating students on climate change and climate policy by implementing a randomized controlled trial. We train teachers in randomly selected junior high and high schools with materials covering the science of climate change as well as impacts and adaptation and mitigation policies, along the lines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The effect of being exposed to our modules will be measured with surveys to teachers and both students and their parents as well as with secondary data on students’ attendance, performance, and high school track choice. Surveys will be administered before and after the intervention, in both treated and control schools, including after the control schools receive their treatment as well, following a staggered implementation. The primary outcome variables include, among others, climate change literacy, beliefs, attitudes and understanding about climate change and climate policy, including public support for the latter, and climate-friendly behaviors, which will all also be analyzed under the lenses of two-way intergenerational transfers of knowledge. Italy offers a great opportunity to serve as a laboratory to the rest of the world. Our randomized controlled trial will provide lessons to all policymakers interested in introducing similar programs in their school system. Policy implications, however, go beyond the classroom. Our intervention will also inform policymakers and practitioners on the role of communicating climate policy, and on the potential for reverse inter-generational learning, through which pupils educate their parents and influence their behaviors."
