abstract: "This study examines the impacts of mentors, especially their gender and gender-related characteristics, on college students' educational expectation, performance and persistence. First-semester bachelor students can voluntarily register for a mentoring program. If registered, they will be randomly assigned to an upper-year student mentor from the same study program. Thanks to the exogenous variation of mentors across groups, I can study the causal mentor effects. "
