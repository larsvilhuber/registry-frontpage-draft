abstract: "This study examines the effects of integrating a Generative AI (GenAI) tool (a company interface based on GPT4), on team dynamics and the division of labor in a large multinational consumer product company. Participants from Commercial  and R&D functions will be randomly assigned to control and treatment groups to collaborate on real business problems during a one-day virtual hackathon. The control groups include individual controls (not using AI) and a Commercial+R&D team without AI. The treatment groups will have either Commercial or R&D paired with GenAI (T1), or both functions working together with GenAI (T2). Participants will work on compatible tasks using real background data from the Fabric Care, FemCare, Grooming, and Baby Care business units, with the goal of producing detailed one-page business solutions. The study aims to answer research questions on whether GPT-4 can substitute certain functions, change teamwork dynamics, and blur boundaries across functions. Crucially, it allows us to compare teams using AI and teams not using AI. The experiment will be conducted in three sessions across the US and Europe on May 13th-15th. The findings will provide insights into how GenAI tools like GenAI can be effectively integrated into collaborative team settings in knowledge-intensive domains within a multinational corporation."
