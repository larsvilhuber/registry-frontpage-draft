abstract: "The objective of the experiment is to test whether the intrahousehold distribution of cash crop income has the potential to constrain agricultural technology adoption among Mozambiquan maize farmers. In cross-sectional survey data of rural Mozambican households, I document a rule of thumb whereby husband-to-wife income transfers as a function of variable maize yields are flat in good years, and decrease in bad years. In a non-unitary, separate spheres household in which labor is non-contractible, income transfers indirectly incentivize the wife's effort in cash crop production. I show analytically that a productivity-increasing technology can exacerbate the misalignment of incentives between husbands and wives if the institution of the intrahousehold transfer fails to evolve.

In the first round of an incentivized game played in couples, wives choose to allocate their labor across their husbands' cash crop and a risk-free market activity; husbands draw an agricultural yield from a probability distribution that is conditional on the wife's labor decision; and husbands choose how to distribute their crop income. The first round of the game permits elicitation of an equilibrium labor allocation and transfer function under a low-return technology that is calibrated to resemble local varieties of maize.

In a second round, we introduce a high productivity maize variety and allow couples to choose labor and transfers. This round permits me to study the extent to which husbands adjust their transfers to wives to induce an increase in wives' maize labor.
