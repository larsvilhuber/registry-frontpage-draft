abstract: "We study the effectiveness of different verbal nudges in charitable donations. We partnered with the largest charity in Chile, who routinely communicate with their donors through their own call center. We designed several scripts using nudges that build on behavioral economics' findings. We test how each script affects (a) donations and (b) their willingness to change their current donation to an inflation indexed currency.
