abstract: "The proposed study is organized around a well-designed and rigorous RCT aimed at identifying the role of knowledge dissemination, skills training and regular practice, achieved by goal setting and regularly monitoring (either by project facilitators/trainers or by local peers), in the sustained adoption of good WASH-related practices. The idea is not only to replace bad habits with good ones but also to maintain them by slow habit formation with the help of regular monitoring, motivation and encouragement. This research endeavor encapsulates about 2,000 mother-child dyads hailing from 100 distinct slum clusters situated in the district of Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, India. We will focus on mothers aged 18-45 years with a child below five years i.e. the focus will be on targeted mothers to see if good hygienic and sanitary practices can be adopted in a more sustained manner. The overall focus of the study will not be on adoption but persistent and continued adoption or habit formation. We will also focus on transmission of good habits from mothers to young kids thereby leading to early childhood development."
