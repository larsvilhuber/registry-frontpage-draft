abstract: "In this project, we aim to study the ability for organizations to increase diversity through job advertisements that highlight certain job characteristics, namely job flexibility and wage growth. We further investigate how such changes to job advertisements affect the perceived attractiveness of a position and applicantsâ€™ expectations in terms of working conditions, working environment, and wages. More generally, we study how the highlighting of certain job characteristics in job ads changes the composition of the applicant pool.

We conduct an RCT and a survey experiment. In this project, we cooperate with a large tech firm. In an RCT, we vary the design of job advertisements to investigate the effects of highlighting different job characteristics on the composition of the applicant pool. The survey experiment is conducted in cooperation with laboratories for economic research of universities across Germany.
