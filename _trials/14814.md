abstract: "Menstruation is a fundamental aspect of womenâ€™s health, yet taboos, stigma, and societal misconceptions persist, impacting the well-being and opportunities of menstruators. This project aims to evaluate whether menstrual health awareness interventions can reduce menstrual stigma, thereby enhancing psychosocial well-being, reducing discriminatory behaviors, and improving educational outcomes such as class cohesion. Using cutting-edge experimental economics methods this project will illuminate these complex relationships in collaboration with a partner NGO in Nepal.
