abstract: "We designed and evaluated a randomized credit intervention where the task of borrower selection was delegated to local intermediaries. In one intervention, named Trader-Agent Intermediated Lending, a randomly selected local private trader was appointed as the agent. In the other intervention, named Gram Panchayat-Agent Intermediated Lending (GRAIL), the local village council selected the agent. Agents were incentivized through repayment-dependent commissions to select creditworthy clients and to enforce loan repayment. These two schemes were compared with a group-based lending (GBL) intervention where 5-member groups self-formed and received joint liability loans. We collected household survey data at 4-month intervals to evaluate the impact of these schemes on farm cultivation decisions, output and profits. "
