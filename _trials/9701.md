abstract: "Many decisions people make have the potential to create positive externalities. This is especially the case for decisions that are made under uncertainty: Starting a business, developing new technologies, or investing into new ventures, are all decisions that involve uncertainty about personal gains and losses, but have potential positive externalities for wider society. For example, a successful entrepreneur may create jobs, knowledge spillovers, or improve welfare through her products and services. The likelihood of a person choosing such entrepreneurial activities is however affected by whether and how societies reward this decision. One channel that may affect such rewards are individualsâ€™ distributive preferences. If individuals hold a preference to reward risk takers who create positive externalities for society, then this creates demand for policies in line with such preferences. How potential externalities affect distributive preferences is however an open question. In this study, I will provide a theoretical framework and a first experimental test of how potential externalities affect distributive preferences when income is earned under uncertainty."
