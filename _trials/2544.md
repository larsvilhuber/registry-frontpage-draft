abstract: "While regular cash transfer programs can have a range of productive impacts (Alderman et al., 2013, Bastagli et al., 2016), international evidence suggests that additional interventions, addressing a wider range of constraints, can be combined with cash transfer programs to further improve households’ productivity and resilience (Banerjee et al, 2015).

The World Bank, IPA and a team of researchers have partnered with governments implementing large-scale social protection programs in 4 West African countries (Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal) to set-up a multi-country randomized control trial and test the effects of a set of productive accompanying measures layered on top of existing safety net programs. The effort is integrated into large-scale national programs and focuses on identifying the most cost-effective package of interventions to address constraints to productivity and resilience.

The productive measures include the creation and coaching of beneficiary groups, the facilitation of savings, community sensitization on aspirations and social norms, life-skills training, micro-entrepreneurship training, a one-time lump sum cash grant, as well as market access facilitation. The research addresses the following main questions: What is the impact of the full package of productive accompanying measures on cash transfer beneficiaries?; How to optimize the package?; How to ensure inclusiveness of the package and impacts on the extreme poor?
