abstract: "Job-related stress is associated with employees’ physical and mental health conditions that threaten organizational outcomes.  This study investigated the effectiveness of Yoga-based cognitive behavioral therapy reducing occupational stress among University teachers in Anambra and Enugu states, Nigeria. Participants included 93 academic staff members from two Federal Universities in two States in Nigeria. Participants were randomly assigned to Y-CBT (N=46) and waitlist control (N=47) groups. The Y-CBT group participated in a 2 hours Y-CBT program weekly for a period of 12 weeks. Two instruments- Single Item Stress Questionnaire (SISQ) and Teachers’ Stress Inventory (TSI) were used to collect data.  Data were collected at baseline; post-test and follow-up evaluations. Means, standard deviations, t-test statistics, repeated measures ANOVA and bar charts were used to analyze data for the study. Results revealed that the perception of stressors and stress symptoms reduced significantly at post-test and follow up assessments among the Y-CBT group, compared to the waitlisted group. It was concluded that Y-CBT modalities could help to minimize the perception of stressors and stress manifestation among university teachers. "
