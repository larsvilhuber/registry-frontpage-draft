abstract: "Our work aims to understand how labor market frictions affect SME growth in India. Without appropriate information about the pool of job-seekers on the market and their individual quality, firms may end up hiring a poor quality worker, hiring a good worker who is a bad match, or choosing to leave a position vacant altogether.  These outcomes are not only costly for firms but also for workers who will face higher rates of unemployment.  In this context it becomes important to design policies that can help firms overcome these frictions. The goal of this research is to determine the extent to which the services provided by online job portals can help firms overcome these constraints. "
