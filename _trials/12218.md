abstract: "Defining a job search strategy is a complex task that requires the processing of a large amount of labor market information in order to choose several parameters, such as the level and allocation of effort or the reservation wage and mobility. The literature and our previous work suggest that these perceptions and decisions are subject to important biases that are highly heterogeneous across the population and that may delay the return to employment or deteriorate its quality. In this study, we take advantage of ex-ante knowledge about different types of job search biases, characterized by the use of a rich panel of subjective expectations, to test the impact of formulating and adapting job search strategy suggestions to job seekers' biases on job search behavior and job acquisition. Using two experimental surveys, we first measure baseline labor market beliefs, expectations, and preferences, and then provide personalized job search strategy recommendations that also vary in their framing. We observe the impact of these recommendations on updated beliefs and search parameters using a follow-up survey, and on search behavior and return to employment outcomes using administrative data."
