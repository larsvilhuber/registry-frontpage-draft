abstract: "There is empirical evidence in the economics, political science, social psychology, and neuroscience literature that humans tend towards motivated reasoning. This implies that they discount new information—or scientific evidence—that runs counter to their prior beliefs and attitudes. This experiment aims at providing causal evidence for the existence and the extent of motivated reasoning in the context of climate action. Specifically, two questions are addressed: (1) How do beliefs on effectiveness of climate policy instruments affect individual preferences? (2) Is there evidence for motivated reasoning? 
We compare one abstract mitigation option, the reduction of the cap in the EU ETS, with a concrete and intuitive option, the reductions of emissions from a coal-fired power plant in Germany, and with a linear combination of the two. The conjecture is that motivated reasoning is more likely for options people are emotionally attached to, or that are part of their identity. Such emotional links are more likely to exist for the coal phase-out than for the EU ETS. 
Each subject makes two sequential choices between the alternatives, whereas the informational condition is manipulated within-subjects. The details of this manipulation are changed across four between-subjects conditions. Three main hypotheses are tested with this design: (1) Provision of information on the effectiveness of mitigation options induces participants to adjust their choices in the second decision in line with the information received. (2) Under baseline, subjects that state to have participated in protests relating to phasing-out coal or extracting coal (prior to making any decision on mitigation options) respond less to information on the relative ineffectiveness of directly reducing emissions by coal-fired power plants. (3) Under a "name and shame" treatment, provision of information on climate effectiveness is less likely vs. basline to induce participants to adjust choices in line with the information provided. Seven further auxiliary hypotheses are also tested."
