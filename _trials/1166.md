abstract: "We exploit the exogenous characteristic of random freshmen course assignment in a large Chilean university to identify the causal effect of teachers and their qualitative characteristics over students' major choice. Using administrative records, we establish what makes students from the ``Commercial Engineering'' career chose between an ``Economics'' major or a ``Business'' major. This is tested under different provided specifications. Placebo-type tests are performed."
