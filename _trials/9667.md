abstract: "We measure the ability of non-experts to predict the performance of humans and AI in an incentivized laboratory experiment.
We compare the objective predictability of humans and AI in a given context with the subjective beliefs about the predictability. We manipulate the information about the type of the agent, human or AI, given to participants and measure how this information affects participants' performance. "
