abstract: "Despite investing millions of dollars in large-scale literacy interventions and programs, researchers, policymakers, and educators are struggling to improve low-income children’s reading comprehension outcomes. In urban districts like Charlotte-Mecklenburg, North Carolina (CMS), only 27% of low-income children read proficiently on the Grade 4 National Assessment of Reading, which assesses students’ reading comprehension—that is, their ability to form a deep understanding of science and social studies texts. To address the challenge of accelerating low-income children’s reading comprehension, district leaders in Charlotte, NC have undertaken a strategic plan to improve students’ ability to read and write with evidence in response to informational text. Despite the progress made to date, district leaders—the Chief Academic Officer, Director of K-12 Literacy, and the Executive Director of K-5 Learning and Teaching—are eager to build on a research-practice partnership to study innovative and evidence-based models of reading instruction.
This project aims to explore whether implementation of a Model of Reading Engagement (MORE) can improve long-term reading comprehension outcomes in high-poverty elementary schools. The model addresses critical gaps in research and practice. First, we bring conceptual clarity to the idea of “reading engagement” by validating an instructional model for promoting students’ reading engagement at school and home. Put simply, our definition of reading engagement is this: Engaged readers are motivated to read deeply in school to acquire conceptual knowledge and to read widely at home for enjoyment (Cipielewski & Stanovich, 1992; Guthrie et al., 1998; Guthrie & Wigfield; 2000; Kim et al., 2016a). Teacher instruction during the school year is critical to fostering engaged readers. In essence, teacher instruction is the key lever that is likely (a) to improve students’ informational text comprehension and motivation to read and learn in science through a 6-lesson thematic unit and (b) to promote wide reading of informational books at home during summer and ultimately improvement in reading comprehension.
The present project systematically tests an innovation in a tightly controlled research design in one district. In the context of a research-practice partnership in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, we will explore how MORE fosters students’ motivation and comprehension of informational books in school (i.e., science texts), wide reading of informational texts at home, and reading comprehension outcomes."
