abstract: "Information about children's school performance appears to be readily available. Do frictions prevent parents, particularly poor parents, from acting on this information when making decisions? I will conduct a field experiment in Malawi to test the following research questions: First, are parents' baseline beliefs about their children's academic performance inaccurate? Second, does providing parents with clear and digestible academic performance information cause them to update their beliefs and correspondingly adjust their investments? Finally, if these frictions exist, are they worse among the poor?
