abstract: "Mission Kakatiya is a minor irrigation project under the Department of Irrigation and Command Area Development of the government of the state of Telangana, India, involving civil works to repair and restore water tanks in the state for local agricultural water use. The government is rolling out this project to all tanks in the state – approximately 46,500 in total – over 5 phases spanning 5-7 years. Phases 1 and 2 have already been completed or are underway. Our research entails a two-part impact evaluation of the program. The first component of the evaluation will assess the impact of the phases that are already completed or are currently underway (phases 1 and 2) through a non-experimental methodology involving a sample of 752 tanks. The second component will assess the next phases to be rolled out (phases 4-5) through a randomized encouragement design—that is, actual tanks taken up for restoration under phases 4 or 5 can be subsets of respective lists of randomly selected tanks that the research team will provide for these phases—involving a sample of 92 tanks. Specifically, our research investigates how a water tank restoration effort by a centralized government impacts farm productivity, agricultural output for important crops (paddy, cotton, and maize), water table levels, and agricultural income (revenue net of costs) in the area surrounding a tank. The study will also examine corollary questions, such as identifying the characteristics of tanks that have the largest impact on primary outcomes and determining how water from tanks is distributed among farmers in the area served by the tank (command area)."
