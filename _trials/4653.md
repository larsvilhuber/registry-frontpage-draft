abstract: "This research project analyses the Dual VET-Apprenticeship component of the Enhanced Skills for Sustainable and Rewarding Employment (ENSSURE) project (http://enssure.org.np/), financed by the Swiss Development Agency (SDC) and implemented jointly by the Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) and HELVETAS Swiss Intercooperation Nepal (Helvetas).

The Dual VET-Apprenticeship program lasts two years. The first three months and the last month consist of classroom education. The months four to 23 combine two days of classroom education with three days of workplace training each week. Upon successful completion, graduates receive the formal Technical School Leaving Certificate (TSLC). 

To analyse the causal effect of the apprenticeship on the labor market situation, the research project randomizes applicants of the second cohort starting in November 2019. This cohort comprises training places for 960 apprentices.
