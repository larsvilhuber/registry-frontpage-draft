abstract: "In this project, we seek to study behavioral and non-behavioral impacts of watching a segment from an informative documentary video that provides an in-depth look at modern, industrial-scale pork production. We are interested in measuring the effect of the video on dietary choice at different timescales. We are also interested in measuring any effect on participantsâ€™ worldviews, as a means of testing economic theories of worldview change."
