abstract: "Labor courts are essential for the workings of well-functioning labor markets. However, the courts in many lower-middle and low-income countries are rendered dysfunctional by large backlogs in resolving cases, corruption, low settlement rates, poor enforcement, and limited access to justice. The labor courts in Mexico exemplify these issues. Data from surveys conducted as part of a pilot project show that parties are overly optimistic about their chances of winning the case. There is suggestive evidence that those represented by private lawyers are particularly prone to excessive optimism. We posit that this owes partly to the incentives of private lawyers and agency problems. We aim to understand whether providing plaintiffs and defendants with unbiased statistical information and conciliation services increases settlement rates. We conduct an experiment with three scalable treatments (plus a control group). The first treatment provides parties to cases with objective statistical information about expected outcomes. The information is customized to the filing and comes from analysis of more than 5000 recent cases. The second treatment provides statistical information plus reimbursement for the cost to travel to the public attorney’s office. The third treatment provides information and encouragement to use pre-judicial conciliation. These treatments are organized in one pure control group and 4 intervention groups, varying information provided and transport assistance to the public attorney's office across them. We conjecture that each of these treatments will cause parties to be better informed about their case and the likely outcomes, and that conciliation will increase, and that welfare will increase.

We seek to answer the following questions:

1.	Are worker’s expectations about suing and winning the trial unbiased on average relative to outcomes of recent lawsuits with similar characteristics?
2.	Does providing statistical information about outcomes of cases like theirs lead to expectation updating? Does it lead to more out-of-court settlement? Does it lead to larger welfare in terms of having a job, self-reported welfare, and amounts earned?
3.	Does giving information about the existence of public (and free of cost) lawyers early on lead to more conciliation and improved self-reported welfare? 
4.	Do private lawyers inflate expectations and reduce conciliation?
