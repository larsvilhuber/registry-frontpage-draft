abstract: "In recent years, mass support for feminism has emerged through demonstrations and strikes for gender equality worldwide. This situation has been particularly intense in Spain since 2018:  despite the difficulty in measuring the observance of such action, the strength of the mobilization in this country would appear to be unique the world over. This has contributed to the resurgence of feminism in the mainstream mass media and its growing popularity in public discourse. Indeed, identifying as a feminist may have become a mark of pride and a source of cultural capital for many women (Benedictis et al. 2019). However, at the same time as the emergence of feminism, there has been a rise in support for the far-right party and the conservative party in Spain. The far-right party VOX got representation in the parliament for the first time in 2019 General Elections. These parties have a discourse based on traditional gender roles or assume that gender equality has been reached.
In 2019, in a previous study, we analyzed to what extent support for equality is spread among young citizens, also how they value or reject the concept of feminism. In this second study, we replicate the examination of support for equality between men and women and feminism among a sample of adults between 18 and 65 years old. Based on these initial findings, we will now conduct an experiment for the adult population. The comparison is twofold: we will run the comparison between men and women and among age groups/generations.
