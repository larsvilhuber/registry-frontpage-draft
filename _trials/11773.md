abstract: "Over-application of fertilizers is common in Indonesia. Soil tests combined with individualized fertilizer recommendations can help to reduce the over-application of fertilizers. However, local agricultural extension offices are budget constrained and at this point in time, soil tests are not offered widely. If farmers are willing to pay part of the soil test costs this could increase the spread of soil testing among small-scale farmers. This study explores small-scale farmers’ willingness to pay for soil tests in Indonesia. To elicit farmers’ willingness to pay for soil testing we will use an incentive-compatible auction, based on the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) approach. We will compare two experimental arms, the WTP Service (WTP-S) and the WTP Collective Good (WTP-CG). We designed the experimental arms in a way that they cover two possible ways in which the soil tests could be distributed among farmers outside of our experiment by government extension offices. In the first experimental arm, we will offer farmers the chance to bid for the service of having their soil tested with a rapid soil test. In the second experimental arm, farmers are asked to make a bid for their contribution to buy the complete soil test kit as a group. A further design feature of our sample is that half of the farmers were randomly assigned to a one-day training on soil fertility management in 2022. Hence, we will test whether farmers who were offered that training systematically differ in their price bids from those farmers who were not offered that training. The results will provide insights for stakeholders that provide extension to small-scale farmers in low- and middle-income countries. The results can further guide the Indonesian Government on how to improve small-scale farmers’ soil management to enhance the environmental sustainability of farming; one of the key challenges Indonesia faces in the decades to come."
