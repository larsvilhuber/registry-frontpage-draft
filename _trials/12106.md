abstract: "This paper uses data from an RCT that was pre-registered with AsPredicted.org and published in ReStat.  Some parts of that pre-registration deal with analysis that didn't make it into that paper, but appear in a new paper that we intend to submit to AEA journals.  The relevant pre-registration remains the AsPredicted document from before the study was run.

Healthy food choices are a canonical example used to illustrate the importance of time preferences in behavioral economics.  However, the literature lacks a direct demonstration that they are well-predicted by incentivized time preference measures.  We offer direct evidence by combining a novel, two-question, incentivized time preference measurement with data from a field experiment that includes grocery purchases and consumption.  Our present-focus measure is highly predictive of food choice, capturing a number of behaviors consistent with self-control problems, which provides direct evidence for the common assumption that important aspects of nutrition are driven by time preferences."
