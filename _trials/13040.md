abstract: "We design a lab-in-the-field experiment to investigate the pro-social behavior of children aged 5 to 12 who were exposed to violence resulting from civil conflicts in Colombia. The children decide how to allocate their time to a real-effort task to earn money for themselves or a matched child-in-need in response to receiving a small low-visibility gift, a high-visibility gift, a choice between gifts, or no gift at all. Our study offers insights into government policies aimed at supporting children in regions affected by the ongoing turmoil due to internal conflicts in Colombia.
