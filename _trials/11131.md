abstract: "Young married women in rural India are socially isolated, with potentially negative consequences for their psychological and subjective well-being, empowerment, and access to information. There is significant evidence on the positive economic effects of traditional in-person women’s groups focused on economic activities such as self-help groups and microfinance groups. In this study, we examine the role smartphone social media-based friendship groups can play in furthering women’s interests. We will evaluate the impact of participating in facilitated women’s friendship groups that involve significant smartphone-based interaction, on social networks/interactions, psychological well-being, subjective well-being, and empowerment. Further, we may explore the potential for such groups to provide a safe space to discuss and question social norms pertaining to women’s work, technology adoption, and fertility choices.
