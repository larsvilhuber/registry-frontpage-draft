abstract: "We conduct a correspondence test in the shared housing market to determine the role of personality signaling images posted on fictitious social media profiles on selection decisions. Approximately 3,000 fictitious applications with a randomly assigned social media profile are sent to vacant room ads to determine the effect of personality information on callback rates. The profiles were created over the course of three years to credibly signal high (low) conscientiousness and high (low) agreeableness/low (high) neuroticism, respectively – reflecting the Big Five personality traits most pertinent to selection decisions in both shared housing markets and organizational settings. We conducted several randomized online pilot experiments to verify that the selected images posted on the profiles accurately represent the intended personality dimensions, while also ensuring the realism of the profiles. In addition, we can approximate whether landlords or roommates visit these profiles and exploit this information using statistics on profile visits and page impressions."
