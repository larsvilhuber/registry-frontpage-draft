abstract: "This study investigates whether the provision of gender-specific information on math ability and the suitability of various occupations affects beliefs regarding math ability/suitability, occupational search behavior, and occupational choice. We conduct a field experiment with Swiss students who are imminently choosing apprenticeships, a consequential decision for their eventual occupational outcomes. The experiment is conducted through an online survey in which students are randomized into two groups: (1) a treatment group that is shown a gender-specific information video that emphasizes that girls (boys) tend to be under- (over-) confident in math, which leads them to neglect certain more (less) math-intensive apprenticeships, and then advertises several occupations that are more (less) math-intensive for students to consider, and (2) a control group that is shown a video with information unrelated to specific occupational requirements/fit. We analyze whether the video affects (1) beliefs about own math ability (2) beliefs about the suitability of more (less) math-intensive occupations for themselves, (3) beliefs about the suitability of more (less) math-intensive occupations for other students with the same gender, (4) interest in more (less) math-intensive apprenticeships, and (5) applications for more (less) math-intensive apprenticeships."
