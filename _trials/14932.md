abstract: "Rice production in West Africa is increasingly challenged by water scarcity and the need to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) has been recognized as a climate-smart practice that enhances water efficiency and reduces methane emissions in rice farming. This study aims to evaluate the potential of a digitalized AWD system compared to traditional, non-digitalized AWD methods in Ebonyi State, Nigeria. Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, 200 smallholder rice farmers will be randomly assigned to two groups: one implementing the digitalized AWD system and the other using conventional methods. The digitalized AWD system will employ Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and mobile technology to monitor and optimize irrigation schedules, while the control group will rely on traditional visual assessments for water management. The study will measure key outcomes, including rice yield, water use efficiency, and methane emissions. It is hypothesized that the digitalized AWD system will outperform traditional methods, providing higher yields, reducing water usage, and lowering methane emissions.  This research will contribute to the growing evidence base on the role of digitalization in climate-smart agriculture and offer insights into scalable solutions for sustainable rice production in Nigeria and other parts of West Africa. Findings from this study have the potential to inform policy and practice, promoting technology-driven innovations for resilient and efficient farming systems."
