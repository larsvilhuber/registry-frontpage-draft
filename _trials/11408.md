abstract: "Brophy et al. (2022) document that compared to venture capital (VC) fund partners (GPs) with VC experience (i.e., ``managers''), GPs with entrepreneurial experience (i.e., ``creators'') are at least 20\% more likely to invest in successful deals through syndication or start a follow-on fund. This experiment is partially designed to complement the empirical findings in Brophy et al. (2022) by examining the investment preferences of US limited partners when making an allocation among different VC funds."
