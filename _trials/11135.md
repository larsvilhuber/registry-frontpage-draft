abstract: "Trust is a desirable feature in markets for experience goods as it induces demand. Therefore, if consumers believe it is very unlikely to find sellers that offer high-quality goods, this type of markets may break down. Consequently, a change in consumer beliefs can boost demand for experience goods. In this paper, we experimentally test if a shock to consumer beliefs, namely the entry of a quality-conscious seller into the market, can boost demand for an experience good. We conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment with farmers in Western Kenya, where we recreate an agricultural input market. Specifically, participants choose between two types of goods: one with fixed quality and another one with varying quality, which is unknown ex-ante. Some randomly selected respondents also have the chance to select the varying-quality good from two types of distributions, which respondents partially know. One of those quality distributions, which represents the quality-conscious entrant seller, has a smaller mean and variance than the incumbent distribution. Additionally, we elicit respondents' beliefs about the quality distributions to test whether the effect of entry on demand depends on consumer beliefs rather than the true quality distribution of the experience good in the market. Finally, we elicit participants willingness-to-pay for the different goods offered throughout the game to observe if their valuation varies depending on the quality distribution they face."
