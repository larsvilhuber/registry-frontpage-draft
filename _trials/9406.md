abstract: "In this study we will investigate information preferences on information about privacy. We will explore to what extent people who are watching videos would choose to read a privacy notice, and how this might differ given the content of videos they are watching. We will randomize the participants into four treatments, varying along two dimensions; the videoâ€™s content, either entertaining or normal, and the minimum time indicated that it would take to the read the privacy notice, either 10 or 30 seconds. We will measure the likelihood of avoiding privacy information, as well as the actual time that participants spend on the different elements of privacy information throughout the task. The difference in information avoidance between the treatment groups is the main hypothesis of this study. We will also test two secondary hypotheses on the mechanisms behind reading privacy information. The first mechanism investigates whether people avoid privacy information if they perceive that reading a privacy policy could negatively affect the experience of watching a video. The second mechanism focuses on whether higher trust towards the company that is handling the personal data could be an enabler for avoiding privacy information."
