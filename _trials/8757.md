abstract: "This study examines how customizing motivational messages for volunteer agents by personality traits influences performance and motivation in the context of agricultural extension in Rwanda. We administered a phone survey with 10,187 village agricultural volunteers (FPs) to gather personality traits using Susceptibility to Persuasion Scale (STPS) questions and designed four sets of SMS task reminders that appeal to four different STPS personality traits.  We then randomly assigned volunteers to receive (i) no SMS messages, (ii) randomly assigned SMS messages, (iii) personality-matched messages, or (iv) personality-mismatched messages. In addition we cross-randomize whether FPs receive a reminder of the performance goals they set. We will compare self-reported performance and motivation among agents across experimental groups using a combination of phone survey data and administrative data. "
