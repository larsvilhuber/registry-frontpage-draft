abstract: "This project aims at investigating the dynamics of constitutional change. What drives the demand for (more) devolution, or even secession? Do these attitudes lie on one and the same spectrum? While politically and historically-rooted factors matter in this respect, critical junctures in the form of large, external shocks surely have their part to play as well?
We focus on the latter and propose to run a large online survey experiment Scotland and England exploiting the Covid-19 epidemic as an exogenous shock on the political institutions. "
