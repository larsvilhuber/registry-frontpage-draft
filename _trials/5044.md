abstract: "We conduct a laboratory experiment to investigate how individuals allocate scarce cognitive resources across two tasks. We study how monetary incentives for solving the different tasks influence cognitive resource allocation, task performance, and individuals’ propensity to stay passive and follow a randomly specified default in one of the tasks. Furthermore, we examine how treatments that foster active decision-making in one task affect the quality of individuals’ choices in the treated as well as the non-treated task. "
