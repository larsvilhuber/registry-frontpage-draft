abstract: "This project considers the factors influencing the willingness of South African citizens to comply with the preventive measures (wearing masks, social distancing, etc.) and lockdown regulations implemented to fight the spread of Covid-19. The point of departure is that these factors are determined by personal characteristics: risk preferences, impatience and self-control, and social preferences (altruism, generosity and willingness to cooperate). The primary goal of the project is to identify the effect of these behavioural dimensions on compliance. Understanding these effects is an essential first step in designing better-targeted measures during and after the crisis, and in optimising the impact communications have on behaviour to prevent the spread of the virus.
