abstract: "Policy projections and recent research suggest that large numbers of irregular migrants from sub-Saharan Africa will continue to attempt to make their way to Europe over the next few decades. In response, European countries have made and continue to make significant investments in information campaigns designed to discourage irregular African migration. These campaigns are frequently accompanied by evaluations of some sort but, to our knowledge, none have involved a well-powered, randomized controlled trial with a representative sample and actual migration as an outcome. 

This pre-analysis plan describes the design of field experiment that addresses the following core questions: Are beliefs about migration-related risks, interest in attempting irregular migration, and actual migration decisions responsive to information campaigns highlighting the risks of the migration journey? The project takes place in Edo and Delta states, in the South-South region of Nigeria, a major Sub-Saharan African source of irregular migrants to Europe."
