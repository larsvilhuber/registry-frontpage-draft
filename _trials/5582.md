abstract: "We will run an experiment to test different ways of framing a message that promotes social distancing at the time of the COVID-19 crisis. The different variants of the message will differ in their focus, from an emphasis on personal risk to risk for family, other people, and for society as a whole. We will test what are the impacts of receiving different messages on self-reported compliance with social-distancing recommendations, as well as on indicators of behaviour from register data. We will run the experiment with a large sample of Danish residents who will receive the messages through the official channel of communication used by public authorities. "
