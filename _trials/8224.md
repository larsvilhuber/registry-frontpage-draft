abstract: "Differential access to credit is one of the key drivers of the large and persistent profit gap between women- and men-owned firms. Credit guarantee schemes are a common and promising policy tool to increase credit to targeted sectors but their impact on financial institution lending and firm access to credit remains understudied, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. This study will evaluate the impact of a partial portfolio credit guarantee for women-owned firms on credit supply and access to credit in Burkina Faso. Our evaluation will randomly assign independent financial institutions operating under a common credit federation into either a treatment group whose eligible targeted-sector loans will be covered by the guarantee or to a control group whose eligible targeted-sector loans will not be covered by the guarantee. We will measure the impact of access to the guarantee using administrative credit union data by comparing the loan portfolio and lending decisions of the treatment credit unions to the control credit unions. We will supplement our credit union-level analysis with a panel survey of women-owned firms operating in the catchment areas of the credit unions to measure the impact of the program on firm-level outcomes including access to credit, profits, and innovation."
