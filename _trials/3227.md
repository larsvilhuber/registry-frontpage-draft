abstract: "This study will examine whether there is under-investment in diffusion of new technologies due to information spillovers. We will explore potential market failure attributable to within-industry spillovers of unilateral marketing and education activities. If technology suppliers cannot internalize all of the producer surplus from marketing and education, government subsidization of these activities could lead to more efficient diffusion rates.

In particular, we will analyze information spillovers for Lightapp’s industrial energy efficiency technology for air compressors. We will first randomize marketing and subsidies for the technology across industrial facilities in Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison service territories. We will then use a stepped wedge randomized design to estimate the software’s energy and bill impacts. After removing references to Lightapp, we will share these results with a random selection of previously uncontacted firms. We will elicit willingness to pay for the Lightapp software from these firms and from a set of control firms that receive no information. This will enable us to compare the effects of education about one energy efficiency product on willingness to pay for a similar energy efficiency product, potentially offered by a competitor.
