abstract: "The COVID-19 pandemic calls for collective action. In efforts to slow down the spread of the virus, governments across the globe are instructing citizens to maintain a physical distance from others and avoid crowds (“social distancing”). Public health authorities and experts agree that minimizing physical contact between people is a key measure for mitigating the COVID-19 outbreak. But what kind of information is most effective for eliciting social distancing compliance? The study examines how different COVID-19 information cues—appealing to prosocial motivation and empathy in varying degree—affect self-reported social distancing compliance. Using a split-ballot survey experiment, a non-probability sample of US residents are exposed to one of five information cues. We examine intention-to-treat effects in relation to two social distancing outcomes."
