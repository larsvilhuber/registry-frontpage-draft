abstract: "Whether face masks are effective in slowing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic is still a heavily debated subject. Following up on an earlier field experiment (https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/5735), we seek to investigate whether a face mask policy change impacts the distance-keeping between individuals in public spaces in Berlin (Germany) where masks recently became compulsory in public transport and in stores. In this current study, we replicate the study design from an earlier study which was conducted before face masks became compulsory. 
We found in the earlier study that individuals keep a significantly greater distance from experimenters wearing a mask compared to those not wearing one. In the present experiment, we expect the policy change to significantly affect the distance-keeping in response to face masks."
