abstract: "There is significant and persistent heterogeneity in unemployment rates and labor earnings across labor markets in the US, contributing to overall economic inequality. Developments since the 1990s indicate that migration has declined even as job posting websites have expanded access to and awareness of employment opportunities beyond a workerâ€™s location of origin. This project explores the importance of workers' geographic location when applying to online job postings to proxy for access to job opportunities for job seekers who are local and non-local. We examine how job applicant characteristics, specifically a worker's current location, implied gender, and implied career stage/age affect employer contact/callback rates across several occupations and cities in the USA. Methodologically, this study conducts a resume correspondence experiment, randomly assigning the resumes of fictitious candidates with different geographical locations to employers who are actively seeking employees to determine if employers' have a location preference for their new hires. We also address potential mechanisms for why employers may prefer local applicants and engage in place-based discrimination."
