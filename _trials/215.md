abstract: "This study will explore whether, and to what extent one’s social identity affects one's aspirations (as captured by a one’s short and long term goals), beliefs about future outcomes as well as real short run outcomes. Secondly, it will investigate how the salience of one’s caste or gender identity affects a parent's beliefs about, and goals for her child, and how this affects the latter’s eventual (short run) outcomes. The study design will also allow us to investigate the effects of setting goals itself on short run outcomes.
The experiment will be conducted across nineteen villages in Pali district, Rajasthan. Short run goals, beliefs and outcomes will be studied in the context of extra Math classes being run in grades 6 to 8 by volunteer teachers. The implementing partner is the NGO, Educate Girls.
