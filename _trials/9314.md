abstract: "A growing number of studies highlight the potential of formative assessment for improving student achievement and increasing students' self-regulated learning. New technologies offer the possibility to enhance the scope and effective employment of formative assessment practices in schools. However, little is known about what interventions effectively increase whole-schools' systematic and purposeful adoption of digital formative assessment (DFA) practices. The A@L trial evaluates a newly developed online toolkit aimed at increasing lower secondary education schools' readiness to implement digital formative assessment. The toolkit is made available to a sample of school heads, teachers and students across five European Union Member States (Estonia, Finland, Greece, Portugal and Spain). A sample of 208 schools have been sampled and recruited across the five countries and randomly assigned to either the treatment or the control group. Participants in the treatment group are invited to use the toolkit between December 2021 and April 2022. The trial evaluates the effects of the intervention on a set of short-term primary outcomes collected on teachers and related to their awareness, attitudes and knowledge about DFA. Secondary outcomes analyzed include school heads’ awareness, attitudes and intention to support DFA practices; teachers’ actual use of DFA; students’ attitudes toward DFA, learning experience, motivation and self-perceived performance. Outcome data are collected through online surveys administered at baseline and at follow-up (May 2022).
