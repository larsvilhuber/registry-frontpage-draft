abstract: "How can we expand the demand for organic food in developing countries, especially in farmers' markets frequently used by middle and low-income families? We propose a framed field experiment to identify which messages are the most effective in encouraging the substitution of conventional (non-organic) foods for more organic foods in farmers' markets of Cochabamba city, Bolivia. Consumers receive an amount of money to spend buying a basket of fresh food at a store set up exclusively for the experiment, where they can see, touch and smell the food before selecting it. After choosing conventional foods for their basket, we randomly assign them to a treatment that consists of an informative message. Then, we give them the option of exchanging their initial food choices for more organic ones. There are four treatments and a control group. Each treatment contains one or two of the following parts: (1) a color scale (e.g., traffic lights) which rates foods by how far they are from organic production, and (2) information on the consequences of consuming conventional foods in health or the environment."
