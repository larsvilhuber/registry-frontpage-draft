abstract: "We will conduct an experiment to investigate how strategic decisions are affected by information about the opponent’s characteristics. Subjects will play a series of 22 guessing tasks where they will have to guess a number as close as possible to an anonymous opponent’s guess times a multiplier. By means of randomized treatments, we will study how their decisions are affected by revealing specific information about the opponent. In doing so, we will leverage a growing literature on perspective-taking, which suggests that being able to take someone else’s perspective may guide decision-making in strategic settings."
