abstract: "Benefits Data Trust (BDT) is a national not-for-profit organization based in Philadelphia committed to transforming how individuals in need access public benefits. Using a data-driven and technology-based approach, BDT provides targeted outreach and comprehensive applications assistance to individuals who are likely eligible for public benefits. 

This randomized trial investigates the impact of BDT’s outreach and application assistance to individuals aged 60 and over who are likely to be eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Through random assignment to receive BDT’s assistance, outreach only, or to control, we plan to study the impact of outreach and application assistance on the level of take-up and characteristics of the marginal individual induced to enroll due to the intervention."
