abstract: "The Diffa region of Niger--once known for trade of fish and agricultural products--now shelters one refugee for every four residents due to the devastation wreaked by Boko Haram in nearby Nigeria. Children and teachers in such crisis contexts suffer from absenteeism, high drop-out rates, and migration; this study investigates the impact of low-cost, targeted social-emotional interventions (mindfulness and Brain Games) for refugee, internally-displaced, and local Diffa region that may be better-suited to such contexts over longer-term, more intensive curricular approaches. 

In Fall 2016, we randomized schools (K=30) within matched-pairs to the following conditions: (1) Healing Classrooms Tutoring Basic (K = 15); and (2) Healing Classrooms Tutoring "Plus" (K=15). The "Plus" condition received the targeted intervention of Mindfulness in Fall of 2016 and executive-functioning Brain Games in Spring 2017. Within schools, eligible students were randomized to receive access to Healing Classrooms Tutoring or Healing Classrooms Tutoring Plus, based on the condition of the school. 

All schools remained in their initial randomization for fall of 2017. One school was unable to continue due to unstable security conditions, necessitating its corresponding pair to be dropped from the research sample. The conditions for year two were (1) Remedial Support Basic (K = 14); and (2) Remedial Support "Plus" (K=14). The "Plus" condition received the targeted intervention of Brain Games for the 22-week intervention. Within schools, students were re-tested for eligibility and re-randomized in year two. "
