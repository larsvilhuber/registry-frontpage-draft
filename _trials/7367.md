abstract: "We randomize the promotion of a program that helps workers making less than the monthly minimum wage in Colombia order to encourage enrollment. We use random assignment to the treatment to evaluate the effect of signing up for the program on savings for old age through the program, other financial savings, saving in non-financial assets, labor supply, and consumption.
