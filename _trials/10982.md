abstract: "Failures in threshold public goods bargaining have a potentially large impact on social welfare, and incomplete information has long been regarded as one of the most important factors leading to conflicts. The research question of this study is “How can we lessen the negative effect of incomplete information in threshold public good bargaining?”. This project focuses on disagreements caused by two-sided incomplete information on participants’ benefit from the public good. "
