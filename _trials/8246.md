abstract: "Over usage of screen time such as cell phones can significantly reduce productivity.  One important reason for the over usage of phones can be the lack of self-control. Commitment devices such as productivity or screen control apps have been developed to help people to overcome self-control problems. Yet, the number of users who adopt such a commitment device remains limited. This project aims at understanding the reasons for the low take-up rate of the commitment device. In particular, we test the hypothesis that individuals may underestimate their screen time usage and therefore lack motivation to download and use the app.  We design information intervention mechanisms that aim at increasing the awareness of the problem of over usage of screen time and thereby promoting the interest in downloading and using the app to control the screen time."
