abstract: "The creation of a tax system that raises substantial revenues efficiently and equitably is one
of the central challenges in economic development. In large part, this relies on the creation of
the capacity to enforce taxes effectivelyâ€”to reduce tax evasion. Doing this requires a detailed
understanding of the drivers of tax evasion and the optimal allocation of extremely scarce tax
enforcement resources. Our project combines new theory and a Randomized Controlled Trial
(RCT) in Paraguay to provide new insights into tax evasion by firms, the strength of enforcement
spillovers through production networks, and how to optimally target enforcement activities."
