abstract: "Recent evidence suggests that workers are willing to sacrifice a significant portion of their wages to work jobs with better job attributes (e.g., flexibility in scheduling or the ability to work from home). In our project, we will introduce a hypothetical choice experiment into a Dutch Panel survey (LISS) in order to investigate differences in the valuation of job attributes. We are particularly interested in gender differences. In a second step, we will analyze how preferences for non-wage attributes relate to retirement income. Trading off wages for job attributes has an immediate effect on wages, but this implies important consequences for eventual retirement income. To investigate whether individuals take into account the trade-off between current non-wage attributes and future retirement income, we introduce a treatment variation in a discrete choice experiment that makes the long-term consequences salient.
