abstract: "Metadata is data about the data. It is introduced for archival purposes but now serves a more active role: machine-readable metadata is crucial for making the documented studies "findable" by modern search engines. We investigate different motivational treatments for soliciting contribution to metadata. In our experiment, we approach the authors who published papers with online data sets and ask them to provide study-level metadata for the studies that they have published. Our investigation will also shed light on the crowdsourcing approach to supply high-quality metadata at scale."
