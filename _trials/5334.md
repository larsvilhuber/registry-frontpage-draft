abstract: "People often respond to others' hardship by praying for them. Previous studies show that such prayers might come at the expense of reduced material aid. In other words, prayers might crowd out associated material aid for those in need. This effect arises because the prayer itself is perceived as directly helpful to the recipient. In this study, we design a randomized controlled trial to examine how the amount of crowding out is affected by the perceived power of the prayer. We do so by varying the type of prayer between collective and private -- a collective prayer is believed to be more efficient than the sum of individually conducted private prayers.
