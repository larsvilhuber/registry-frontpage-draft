abstract: "Female labor force participation remains strikingly low in many parts of the developing world. This is particularly true in countries with conservative gender norms that limit the interaction of women with non-familial men. In this study, we plan to test the impact of workplace gender composition on female labor force participation.  Our project is based in Bihar, a low-income state in India, where less than ten percent of women work. We plan to test whether the take-up of otherwise identical jobs is higher in workplaces that are women-only compared to ones that are mixed. In additional treatment arms, we test the extent to which safety concerns drive these preferences. "
