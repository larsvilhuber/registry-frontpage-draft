abstract: "The Graduating to Resilience project is a US Agency for International Development (USAID) funded pilot activity, implemented in the Rwamwanja Refugee Settlement and Kamwenge District in the Western region of Uganda by AVSI Foundation, that seeks to improve food and nutrition security and self-reliance among poor households in the refugee settlement and host communities based on the ultra-poor graduation model. In treatment villages, households are randomized into one of three variations of the program: (1) the full graduation program with consumption support, an asset transfer and individual, household-level coaching; (2) the full graduation program with consumption support, an asset transfer and group coaching and (3) the graduation program with consumption support and individual, household-level coaching, but without an asset transfer component.
