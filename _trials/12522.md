abstract: "With the rise of smartphone ownership, social media, and mobile money, there has been a surge in 'social commerceâ€™. This growing phenomenon is especially pertinent for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) seeking foreign market access, historically hindered by search and trust frictions. We study on how these recent digital advancements might reduce frictions in searching and contracting along international supply chains."
