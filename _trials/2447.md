abstract: "Female labor force participation (henceforth FLPF) is very low in Saudi Arabia and social norms appear to be a constraint to female employment in the country. Preliminary evidence collected by the authors suggests that most men in Saudi Arabia might privately support female labor force participation (FLFP), while believing that most other men are against it. These incorrect beliefs might lead men to publicly oppose FLFP. In this project, we plan to “engineer” changes in the social norms regarding FLFP in Saudi Arabia by correcting men's beliefs regarding the opinion of other men. We have partnered with a local company providing a mobile platform to match Saudi women to local jobs. When married men learn that most other men in their broad social environment support FLFP, are they more likely to sign their wives up in a job-matching program?"
