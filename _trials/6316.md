abstract: "Given subjects have preferences for environmental well-being, but fail to perform pro-environmental behaviors
due to a lack of self-control, they are assumed to have a positive willingness to pay for commitment devices
to enforce pro-environmental behavior. Therefore, I plan to investigate whether there is a positive demand for environmental
policy interventions as self-commitment devices on an individual level and whether the preference
for a certain environmental policy is dependent on the time of implementation and the amount of people affected
by it. In a laboratory experiment, I use a pro-environmental real effort task as an opportunity for subjects to behave
environmentally friendly. Prior to the task, subjects are asked to rank policy intervention according to their
preferences. The policy interventions vary in their degree of external pressure from lenient, in a social comparison
nudge, to strict, given a punishment scheme. Since I hypothesize that the intervention choice is dependent on
the time of implementation of the pro-environmental task and group size affected by the policy, the treatment
varies across two dimensions. Firstly, the time of implementation is varied as subjects must either perform the
pro-environmental task within the same day or with a delay of one week. Secondly, the regulation either affects
only the person choosing the intervention or it affects also others in the group. It is assumed that subjects with
lower self-control demand stricter policy interventions. In addition, the more the task is postponed into the future
and the greater the number of other people affected by the choice, the higher the likelihood of choosing more
compulsory interventions."
