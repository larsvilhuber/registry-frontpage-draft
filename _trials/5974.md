abstract: "People tend to be optimistic about their own future. For example, compared to rational beliefs,investors typically expect higher returns from their funds. In line with these observations, previous research has documented that owning a product leads to more optimistic beliefs about its value.However, in many important economic contexts, people choose the products for themselves (e.g.they decide to invest in a particular fund). We propose and experimentally test the explanation that, beyond the effect of ownership, making a choice can lead to additional belief distortions. Using a between-subject design, we compare a person who chooses a product to a person who receives the same product exogenously. This comparison controls for the effect of ownership on beliefs. To address the key concern of endogenous choice, we vary the choice set to create predictable variation in choice."
