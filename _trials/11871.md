abstract: "By means of a randomized (online) survey experiment among a sample of 4000 respondents in Germany we want to examine two research questions related to state welfare benefit reforms (1) how does the population trade off different aspects of reforming welfare benefits and (2) how responsive are employees to modifications of the net wage resulting from changes of the tax system or adjustments of the gross wage?
In the first part of the survey, subjects participate in a vignette study examining the acceptance of reforms of the social transfer system. The second part is a survey experiment on labor supply preferences using between subjects treatment variation concerning the size, direction and cause of a (hypothetical) wage change."
