abstract: "This project’s objective is to study frictions in the process of hiring refugees, and the effectiveness of accurate information and consulting services for firms in reducing such frictions. Depressed labor demand for refugees harms their prospects of successful integration. Despite this, the literature so far has focused on refugee-side interventions. The study's population of firms consists of small and medium-sized businesses, in sectors where refugees frequently find employment. There are two randomized interventions: (1) an information treatment, confronting firms with other firms' experiences with refugees, and (b) an intensive information and counseling treatment. This will be targeted to the specific needs of the firm and will provide information as requested, as well as broker contacts with refugee job-seekers via intermediaries. The main objective of this pilot lies in assessing the impact of the treatment on the hiring probability and other measures of labor demand. However, we also hope to study the second stage effect of hiring refugees on firms’ economic and social outcomes."
