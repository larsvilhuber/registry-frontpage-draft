abstract: "For immigrants learning the language of the host country can facilitate both integration and economic success. While in-class courses are considered first best, the potential of online language learning remains unexplored. We will conduct a field experiment for estimating the impact of a German language-learning platform on different dimensions of refugee integration. We will exogenously increase the salience of this study opportunity for a randomly selected group of recently migrated job-searchers."
