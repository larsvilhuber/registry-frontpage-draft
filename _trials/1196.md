abstract: "Schools that provide higher education often belong to either a merit-based selective system or an open-access less selective system. Because spaces in the selective system tend to be rationed and contingent on a lifetime of academic preparation, improved access to higher education may be more quickly achieved through interventions relevant to the less selective system. We present the results of a field experiment that provided Grade 12 students in Chile with tailored information about financial aid and average earnings for schools and careers in both types of schools. Treated students are more likely to apply to and enroll in higher education. Effects are concentrated among students who must choose from schools in the less selective system. Treated students choose careers and schools with lower expected wages, lower employment probabilities, and lower quality, but offering shorter degree programs with lower tuition."
