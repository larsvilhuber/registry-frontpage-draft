abstract: "Suboptimal diets refer to dietary patterns that deviate from established nutritional guidelines and recommendations. Such diets significantly contribute to diet-related chronic diseases, accounting for approximately one in five adult deaths. Over the past two decades, there have been notable improvements in the diets of Americans. However, a significant number still grapple with inadequate diets. To address this issue more effectively, a Front-of-Pack (FOP) labeling system has been introduced in the United States (US). This system aims to offer relevant nutritional information, attract consumer attention, and nudge consumers towards healthier food choices. However, existing FOP labels have shown limitations in successfully guiding consumers towards more nutritious food options. Acknowledging these concerns, the FDA announced plans in September 2022 to revise the criteria for current health claims commonly featured on FOP labels. This initiative is a response to the need for more effective labels that can successfully nudge consumers towards making healthier food choices. The FDA proposed 15 candidates for "FDA healthy symbols" that food manufacturers can use if their products meet certain criteria to be classified as healthy (e.g., low in sugar, saturated fat, and sodium). These “authority-endorsed” food labels aim to offer consumers essential information that guides them towards healthier food choices. Using the Becker–DeGroot–Marschak method in a lab experiment, this study will focus on evaluating consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for yogurt products that meet the criteria for the FDA healthy symbol. Specifically, we designed 5 treatments that feature different FOP label combinations and detailed description of the criteria, aiming to understand the influence of various FOP label combinations, including the new FDA healthy symbols and taste claims, on consumer purchasing decisions.
