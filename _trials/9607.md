abstract: "We study the impacts of offering monetary incentives for vaccination on future vaccination uptake, safety perceptions, and morals. We use a standard information provision experiment to create random exposure to incentives. We will exploit the fact that many people in the US are unaware that state governments paid people to get vaccinated. The idea is that informing people in the treatment condition that the government paid people to get vaccinated creates random variation in perceived exposure to incentives, allowing us to study the consequences of being exposed to incentives.
