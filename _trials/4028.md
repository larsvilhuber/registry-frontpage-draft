abstract: "The Building Bridges and Bonds study is an evaluation of new program approaches to support low-income fathers in working toward economic stability and improved relationships with their children. The study includes tests of the impacts of the Just Beginning parenting intervention and of the DadTime smartphone app intervention. The Just Beginning and DadTime program interventions were tested in three fatherhood program settings: Children's Institute, Inc. in Los Angeles, CA; People for People in Philadelphia, PA; and Seedco in New York City, NY.  

The Just Beginning parenting intervention is a program that works with fathers and their young children together to improve the quality of father-child interactions; and the DadTime engagement intervention is a smartphone app that aims to improve fathersâ€™ participation in the program by guiding and supporting them in making and following through on plans for attending Just Beginning workshops. It also prompts them to practice skills learned in the parenting intervention.

The impacts of the Just Beginning and DadTime program interventions will be evaluated using an experimental research design. The impact study will address questions about whether the new approaches affect key outcomes of interest, including father-child relationship quality and program participation."
