abstract: "This projects aims to study the role of youth's self perceptions of ability on their sorting patterns across schools. We design and implement a field experiment in which ninth graders from less advantaged backgrounds in Mexico are provided with individualized feedback about their performance on an achievement test. We then look at the effect of the informational intervention on school choices and schooling outcomes at the end of high school."
