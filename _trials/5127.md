abstract: "There is common ground to believe in a difference in productivity when people are working together depending on the consistency and the composition of teams with respect to their personal characteristics. The way teams are built and kept together is key to a successful organization. In this trial, we focus on creative tasks. Personal characteristics of people in these task settings are displayed to a varying extent and the influence of character traits and team consistency is arguably different. We focus on both effects in our evaluation of the trial and consider time perspectives as an influential character trait. The trial consists of a two-person task of 4 minutes executed two times with a little break. In the treatment group, subject teams are randomly changed after 4 minutes, while in the control group teams are kept together for the overall 8 minutes. The creative task requires the teams to recreate given terms with given items.  "
