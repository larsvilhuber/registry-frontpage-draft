abstract: "The MozLand project is a large-scale governmental project that systematically registers individual and community land titles. Through a randomized controlled trial approach, we study the project impacts on female farmers’ investment decisions, productivity, income and empowerment. In addition, motivated by the identification of a large gap at baseline between the private support for women's land rights (WLR) and their perceived support at the community level, we implemented a low-cost information campaign to inform households about the actual levels of community support for WLR. This individual visit takes place prior to the land registration to a random half of sampled households living in communities receiving the Mozland project. This study will inform the design of future land regularization efforts but also inform on the effectiveness of a light-touch information intervention in correcting misconceptions and fostering behavioral change, namely, integrating the woman's name on the land titles.
