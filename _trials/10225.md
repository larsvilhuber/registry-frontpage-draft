abstract: "A substantial share of undergraduate students in the United States are citizens of other countries. This paper investigates if and why many of these international students struggle in the labor market. We implement a resume field experiment in both the United States and Canada, where we send thousands of fictitious resumes to potential employers and randomize ethnicity, immigration status, and other characteristics of applicants.
