abstract: "We analyze the choices available to players of a mobile game, which is a closed economic system. The players’ decisions under risk allow us to estimate changes of risk aversion when wealth changes. In contrast to previous literature, we are able to exclude inertia and the asset integration problem. The field experiment allows for tests against the null hypothesis of constant absolute risk aversion and constant relative risk aversion."
