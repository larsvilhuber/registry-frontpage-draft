abstract: "This study seeks to identify how uncertainty about competition shape labor market outcomes. This paper will use a variant of the ultimatum game that corresponds to posted-offer hiring to identify how uncertain competition alter labor market outcomes. Our ultimatum game will incorporate competition through multiple respondents for a single proposer and will incorporate uncertainty by hiding the true number of respondents from other respondents. "
