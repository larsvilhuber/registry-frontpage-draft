abstract: "This document describes the analysis plan for a randomized laboratory experiment examining the effects of stress on a variety of behavioral outcomes. We recruit approximately 100 respondents from the informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. Using a double-blind procedure, respondents are randomly given a placebo or a 20 mg dose of hydrocortisone, a drug that increases the levels of stress hormones, for seven consecutive days. This plan outlines the design of the study, the outcomes of interest, and the econometric approach.
