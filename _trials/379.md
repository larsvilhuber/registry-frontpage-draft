abstract: "Recent evidence suggests that remedial education can be effective at closing achievement gaps. Remedial education, by which low-performing students receive targeted, self-paced teaching aimed at mastering basic skills, has improved short- and medium-term academic performance. The proposed research project will use student-level random assignment within schools to evaluate the impact of a remedial education program for low-performing third-grade science students in 48 schools in metropolitan Lima, Peru.  Key evaluation outcome measures include studentsâ€™ understanding of science and the environment and achievement relative to higher performing peers."
