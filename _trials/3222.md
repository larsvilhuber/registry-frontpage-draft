abstract: "Payments for ecosystems services (PES) and conditional cash transfers (CCTs) are popular and often effective policy approaches to spur behavior change: paying people to undertake behaviors they otherwise would not. Behaviors being “incentivized” usually benefit society, for example reducing deforestation with PES and increasing vaccination and school attendance with CCTs. However, there remains limited evidence on the effectiveness of PES-type interventions in settings of high deforestation and limited institutional capacity, and no studies have focused on fire—an increasingly prominent way to clear land. Our project is based in West Kalimantan, one of the main provinces where Indonesia’s catastrophic 2015—16 fires were concentrated. The goal of the study is to estimate the effects of cash transfers to village governments reduce fire—offered as a PES contract to the village governments, with payment made after the fire season—by randomly assigning 75 villages to the program and 200 to a comparison group.
