abstract: "Female labor force participation (FLFP) rate is very low in Middle Eastern and South Asian countries while it is considered crucial in poverty alleviation and women’s empowerment. These countries are characterized by Islam and the strong patriarchal social norm against women’s working outside the home. Despite the general public image that Islam restricts women’s behavior, the association between Islam and low FLFP rate shown by the macro-level data provides divergent conclusions. The micro-level empirical studies concerning the impact of religion in general and Islam in specific, on preventing FLFP are scarce despite the apparent close relationship between the religious and social norms. We empirically investigate whether religious information, both positive and negative one, about FLFP affects FLFP by conducting the light-touch randomized controlled trial in Pakistan. Pakistan is one of the lowest FLFP rate countries, and has the second largest Muslim population as 96% of the population are Muslim. We aim to obtain an important policy implication to enhance FLFP in these countries."
