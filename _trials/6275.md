abstract: "We examine how mobile banking services can assist small enterprises managing their finances amidst the COVID-19 crisis. Mobile banking allows remote access to savings and other financial services during the lockdown and once withdrawn -- enabling social distancing and reducing cash handling. We use voice messages to provide information on mobile banking to clients of a large savings and loan organisation in Ghana. By randomly assigning clients to receive voice messages, we are able to causally examine the impact of this information on take-up and use of mobile banking, and how use of mobile banking affects important downstream financial outcomes such as savings and management of business cash flow.
