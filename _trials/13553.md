abstract: "This experiment at the University of San Andrés investigates the effects of blind versus non-blind grading methods on the persistence of grades across undergraduate courses, which are randomly distributed into control and treatment groups. In the control group, instructors can easily identify their students during grading, as students are required to write their full names on their exams. Conversely, in the treatment group, students use anonymized ID numbers, which obscures their identities from the graders. The study evaluates various outcomes, including the overall level of grades, fluctuations between midterm grades, alignment with historical GPA, and the incidence of repeating grades. Additionally, the research includes an analysis of how different grading methods influence these outcomes in relation to student characteristics such as gender, age, financial aid status, and special educational needs (SEN)."
