abstract: "The aim of this study is to analyze the effects of providing information to parents on feeding practices in early childhood. We randomly provide evidence-based recommendations on best practices to the main caregivers of children between 0 and 5 years of age. Parental practices and beliefs regarding feeding and nutrition are gathered through online surveys. This allow us to identify the causal effect of an information policy on parental beliefs and decisions regarding early feeding habits. Our primary outcomes are: feeding practices concerning ultraprocessed food, fish intake, and home-cooked meals. Our secondary outcomes are parental beliefs on feeding practices.

This study is a secondary project from an RCT aimed at studying the effects of providing information on best practices concerning screen exposure in early childhood. The design of the RCT experiment involved an active control group to provide an estimate of social desirability on a similar but unrelated parenting topic, in this case, feeding practices. This allows us to also evaluate the effect of the intervention provided to the active control group as a secondary project, which is the focus of this study. 

The experiment takes place in Uruguay. Potential participants receive an invitation to participate in the study and a small survey to determine eligibility. If individuals are eligible, they receive the baseline survey. Those that fill-out the baseline survey are randomly assigned to treatment and control. The information treatment is provided at the end of the baseline survey.  The intervention consists on a short video with information on best practices concerning screen exposure in early childhood for the treatment group, and on recommendations on feeding practices in early childhood for the active control group. In both cases the information is based on recognised health-institutions. Moreover, a digital leaflet with personalized tips on the topic is provided. The expected sample size is between 1500 and 3000 caregivers at baseline.
