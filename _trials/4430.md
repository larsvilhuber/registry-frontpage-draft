abstract: "Substantial information frictions along supply chains of small firms can generate bottlenecks which slow the dissemination of competitive terms of trade and other market information. This research investigates whether lowering search costs decreases information frictions and improves small firms' ability to source and sell goods in their local area. It leverages the scale-up of a digital phonebook application that effectively lowers the cost of accessing new business and customer networks. Participating small firms are split into a control and treatment group with two variations - 1) a business listing targeting input markets in urban areas, and 2) a business listing targeting customers in output markets in rural areas. The design allows for comparing the extent to which input or output business networks constrain business performance in rural markets and whether lowering the cost of initial contact improves firm productivity."
