abstract: "This project makes use of the current COVID-19 situation to study how worrying about an epidemic affects labor productivity. In an online experiment, participants will be able to work on a cognitively demanding task for a piece-rate wage. Before they start working, a subject-level intervention will present them with real media reports selected to either amplify or alleviate their concerns about the virus. In the analysis, I will then compare participants' task productivity after the intervention across the two experimental conditions. An additional cross-randomized manipulation will allow for an exploratory analysis of whether the high salience of the pandemic in the media exacerbates the effect of worry."
