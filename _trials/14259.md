abstract: "In this project, we study worker perceptions of young firms using two separate survey experiments (note: we are also planning to run a field experiment, which we would register separately once logistical details are worked out). We show participants job ads where the firm type is randomized to test whether people report a higher willingness to apply for an otherwise identical job if it is offered by a young firm. Using this data, we attempt to estimate whether young firms need to offer higher wages to attract workers for observably similar jobs. In addition to this, we ask whether common stereotypes about young firms as employers are true - whether they offer more upside, long-term career benefits, independence and possibilities to advance.
