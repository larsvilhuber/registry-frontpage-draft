abstract: "Information frictions along the supply chain can severely undermine the provision of high quality products and result in a market for lemons. One potential solution to this problem is to attain product certification from external experts. This proposed project investigates why certification may fail to solve the lemons problem driven by asymmetric information on product quality between the producer and the buyer. Through a randomized intervention with dragon fruit farms in Vietnam, I study whether and how producers (i.e. farmers) and buyers (i.e. intermediaries) respond to the testing agency selected for pesticide residue analysis, a critical factor for receiving certification for Vietnamâ€™s Good Agricultural Practices (VietGAP). Specifically, producers are randomly assigned to a testing agency chosen from a list determined by the researcher. I test producer response to the testing agency by comparing pesticide residue levels in dragon fruit across producer groups assigned to different testing agencies. Next, I conduct a survey with buyers to compare their willingness to purchase dragon fruits certified and tested by different agencies.
