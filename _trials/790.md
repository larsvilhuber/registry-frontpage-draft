abstract: "
This document describes the analysis plan for a randomized experiment examining the psychological effect of poverty on cognitive function. We will recruit 260 respondents from informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya, and ex- pose them to either a poverty prime or a control prime in the lab. We then measure cognitive performance using Ravenâ€™s Progressive Matrices and a spa- tial compatibility task. The design of the study is a close replication of Mani et al. (2013). This plan outlines the design of the study, the outcomes of interest, and the econometric approach."
