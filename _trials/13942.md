abstract: "For many job seekers, starting their own business is a way to leave unemployment. When entering self-employment, they usually leave the unemployment insurance (UI) system and are not insured against the risk of unemployment anymore. In Germany, UI benefits recipients starting their own business have the option to enter voluntary unemployment insurance (VUI) at the beginning of their self-employment activity. Insured self-employed pay fixed premiums and are eligible for UI benefits in case they give up self-employment and move back to unemployment. 
 
Our experimental sample consists of UI benefit recipients who leave unemployment for self-employment and who received start-up subsidies granted by the Federal Employment Agency (FEA). To enter the VUI, the self-employed must apply within the first three months after starting the self-employed activity. We randomly select 50% of each monthly cohort of founders over a period of 19 months and send them an information brochure about the VUI and an insurance application form shortly after the start date of their subsidized self-employment activity. We subsequently follow all cohort members over time. This enables us to analyze the impact of the information treatment on the probability to enter the VUI. Further, we investigate to what extent the VUI affects self-employment outcomes."
