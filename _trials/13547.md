abstract: "This paper investigates the impact of the Pharo Foundation's year-long Early Childhood Education (ECE) program in Somaliland. With 14 ECE programs in place, the study focuses on introducing a lottery-based admission system, necessitated by overwhelming demand far surpassing 863 seats. Leveraging the randomness inherent in this admission process, we analyze the multifaceted effects of ECE on children's socio-emotional development, gross and fine motor skills, and emergent math and literacy abilities. Additionally, this research explores potential consequences on children's nutrition, parental mental health, education expectations, and investment. This study is situated within a unique context, as Somaliland lacks public ECE programs, making it a novel setting."
