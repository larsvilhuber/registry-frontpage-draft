abstract: "Across economies, flexibility of working hours responding to workers' needs is rare, whereas employers' expectations of availability for irregular hours remains common. Against this background, Goldin conjecture emerges, that difference in wages between men and women essentially reflects the difference in flexibility rather than only taste based discrimination. We propose a framed field online experiment with vignettes to test empirically the validity of a conjecture that gender wage gap is in fact merely an inflexibility penalty. We elicit wage premium/penalty due to working time flexibility, manipulating information about who initiated the change in working time arrangements."
