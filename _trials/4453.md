abstract: "Attitudes toward risk underlie virtually every important economic decision an individual makes. In this experimental study, I examine how introducing a time delay into the execution of an investment plan influences individualsâ€™ risk preferences. The field experiment proceeds in three stages: a decision stage, an execution stage and a payout stage. At the outset, in the Decision Stage (Stage 1), each subject is asked to make an investment plan by splitting a monetary investment amount between a risky asset and a safe asset. Subjects are informed that the investment plans they make in the Decision Stage are binding and that they will be executed during the Execution Stage (Stage 2). The Payout Stage (Stage 3) is the payout date. The timing of the Decision Stage and Payout Stage is the same for each subject, but the timing of the Execution Stage varies experimentally. "
