abstract: "For over a decade, Heifer Nepal has been developing female-led cooperatives to make producing goats more profitable for farmers. Two benefits offered by these cooperatives are access to government-licensed para-veterinarians called Community Agro-Vet Entrepreneurs (CAVEs) and opportunities to participate in collective livestock sales that leverage the bargaining power of the cooperative. However, challenges remain. CAVEs often feel isolated and find it difficult to develop their skills and support for challenging cases. Cooperatives struggle to organize collective sales due to their large and disperse membership and poor communication infrastructure. To address these challenges, we will implement and evaluate a bundle of technologies to help strengthen livestock cooperatives consisting of a digital Mentoring and Continuing Education (dMCE) platform and a digital Collective Marketing (dCM) tool."
