abstract: "Across the world mothers take the majority and fathers only a small share of parental leave (PL) after individuals become parents. Especially during the first year of a child, mothers spend more time with the child, while fathers continue to work. It is well-documented that this creates gender inequalities in the labor market and affects children’s outcomes, and these effects tend to persist also in the long-term. Therefore, it is important to understand what factors influence this gender difference in responsibility after childbirth.
Potential important factors that can affect the gender difference in parents’ PL plans include to what extent there exist a system for parental allowance (and how it is constructed), gender inequalities in income from work, gender barriers in the labor market, culture and norms (Duvander 2014; Wall and Arnold 2007; Lappegård et al. 2020; Dahl et al. 2014).The current project investigates the role of norms. Norms can be divided into two types (Cialdini et al. 1991). Injunctive social norms are norms about what an individual ought to do. Hence, it is about moral approval (or disapproval) of others. A descriptive social norm is what other people do. In this project, we will conduct a survey experiment to investigate to what extent descriptive social norms – specifically, the number of days other mothers stay home with their children during the first year after childbirth – influence the number of days a particular mother stays home. The rationale for focusing on mothers is that they have received less attention than fathers in the discussion of how to achieve a more gender balanced parental leave take-up (see, e.g., Farre and Gonzalez 2017 and Dahl et al. 2014) although mothers´ behavior also could be important. Norms could play an essential role for mothers and constitute a barrier that hinders mothers from reducing their take-up (which in turn could constrain the father in a couple from increasing his take-up).
