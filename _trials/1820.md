abstract: "By reducing citizen oversight, external financing of public goods in developing countries can exacerbate elite capture and produce sub-optimal outcomes for communities. We test a novel mechanism channeling funds for local public goods via citizens. While control communities are offered block grants to fund local public goods, households in randomly-assigned communities are provided with vouchers that they may contribute to a public good or redeem at a discount for private consumption. Vouchers increase community participation in allocation decisions, satisfaction in decision outcomes, and the probability that allocations reflect the preferences of individuals who had not previously participated in local meetings, when different from those of leaders.
