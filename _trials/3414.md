abstract: "The aim of the study is to test whether changes to the choice architecture of credit card repayment platforms can encourage customers who have persistently been making very low repayments to increase their average credit card repayments, pay off outstanding balances more quickly, and reduce the interest charges they incur. Specifically, we assess whether adding a "Pay 5%" option to the digital platform provided by a leading bank increases average credit card repayments among these customers. We also assess the effect of removing the "Pay Minimum (2%)" option from the menu provided in the platform. In the first case, the intervention is designed to provide an alternative anchor for customers who cannot pay their full balance, but could pay more than the minimum due. In the second case, the intervention is designed to remove the low anchor altogether and allow customers to make a choice with reference only to the high anchor (the full balance)."
