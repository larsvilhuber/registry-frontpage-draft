abstract: "Despite Colombia's very progressive legal protections for the LGBTQ+ communities, same sex households face unique challenges. Of particular concern is school discrimination against the children in schools. If schools prevent or make it more difficult for same-sex parents to register their children in school, this could severely limit the options available to parents and lead them to make suboptimal choices. We aim to determine the existence and quantify the extent of discrimination against children of LGBTQ+ parents through a correspondence study. We will send fictitious requests for information to schools across the country to register a child, randomly varying the names of both parents in a way that conveys different sexual orientations. Our proposed project would add to this literature by providing evidence of discrimination against LGBQT+ families during school applications in the context of Colombia, a developing country that, despite important progress in equalizing the rights of the queer community, still has a long journey to go to further reduce discrimination against minorities."
