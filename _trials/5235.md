abstract: "Research shows that the homeless population is made up of various subgroups that have different biographical experiences, characteristics and needs. This trial focuses on the group of ‘chronically homeless’ individuals, who have posed an enduring challenge for policy makers and practitioners alike. In Australia, responses to homelessness are typically based on high case loads and short-term assistance. While this can help the short-term homeless to regain their housing, it struggles to meet the more complex needs of the long-term homeless.

Journey to Social Inclusion (J2SI) is a pilot program designed to break the cycle of long-term homelessness. The program provides intensive support for up to three years to assist long-term homeless people receive the range of services they need. The J2SI model contrasts with existing services that tend to the short-term responses which do not address the underlying issues causing long-term homelessness.

The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the J2SI intervention using a randomized  experiment. The evaluation involves implementing the J2SI pilot program as a randomized control trial where participants are randomly assigned into two groups: those receiving J2SI services and those receiving existing services. A longitudinal survey will be conducted to examine how the two groups of study participants are travelling at ten points-in-time over a six-year period. While such an approach can provide robust insights into the short, intermediate, and long-term impacts of J2SI, tracking two cohorts of long-term homeless people over a six-year period is not an easy task and requires significant resources and commitment. Nonetheless, in the context of the shift towards evidence-based policies here and overseas, the benefits of using this ‘gold standard’ approach to evaluation outweigh the costs.

We will identify the causal effect of the intervention by comparing differences between the two groups in terms of housing, economic participation, health outcomes and health services usage, other service usage, problematic drug use, and measures of social acceptance and support.
