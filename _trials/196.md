abstract: "This study aims to evaluate a new methodology of focalization of training as well as to analyze peer effects among low-income women in Chile. The main objective is to increase female participation in the Chilean labour market, reducing the existent gender gap. Results suggest benefits at an individual level, rather than effects for the labour market as a whole. In general, tracking groups ("high" and "low" groups) have a better performance than the non-tracking group, particularly for participants that belong to the "low" group. Also, it seems as though belonging to the "high" group has no effects on the satisfaction level of participants. No impact is identified on wages or family income; hours, days or Sundays worked; number of jobs; nor improvements in the labour market. There are no indicators related to employability, job quality or job formality. "
