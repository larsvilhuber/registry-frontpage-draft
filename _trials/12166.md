Community TB stigma and patients TB [Meanscore = 29.191(0.229) vs. 29.893(0.231)]. 2 months, [ms = 12.132(0.091) vs 29.893(0.092), and6, ms=12.132(0.084) vs 30.000, (0.085), F(1,305) = 7905, p<0.001]. as well as:
[Meanscore = 25.145(0.199), vs 25.940(0.201),)]. 2 monhs, [ms =13.105(0.109)vs 25.940(0.109) and 6, ms=11.230(0.350) vs 25.567(0.352), F(1, 305)=1930.7, p<0.001] respectively).
