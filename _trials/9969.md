abstract: "The impacts of climate change are forecasted to vary widely across space and across occupations. Hence, occupation and location change are believed to be promising strategies to foster climate-change adaptation in vulnerable communities. However, it remains unclear whether individuals are informed about the looming changes to their climate, so that they can make the best occupation and location decisions. In this project, we collect unique data on the climate change beliefs of a large sample of individuals in rural Bangladesh. We then experimentally provide forecasts about local climate change and investigate how the provision of these forecasts changes expectations, occupation and migration plans, and policy demand. "
