abstract: "Introduction: HIV infection is a major threat to global health. So far, it has claimed the lives of 25 million people in the world. Recently, Iranian scientists have produced a drug called IMOD to strengthen the immune system. The present study examines the effect of addition of IMOD to the HAART regimen on the immunological status of HIV-positive patients referred to the Counseling Center for Behavioral Diseases in Qom in 2013.
Methods: In a parallel Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial 60 HIV-positive patients with indications for treatment with HAART regimen were enrolled. The participants were randomly assigned, following simple randomization procedures (1 : 1), to receive IMOD  or placebo along with the common treatments Participants and those assessing the outcomes were blinded to group assignment. Patient assigned to placebo received the same solution as IMOD but without IMOD Active ingredients control group those received HAART therapy and the intervention group (the patients underwent IMOD infusion in addition to HAART therapy). The IMOD used in this study was a vial containing 120 mg in 4 ml. Random sampling was performed. CBC, LFT,BUN, Cr, TLC, CD4 were measured before and after treatment. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS 16.
Results: The mean age of patients in the intervention and control groups was 35.5 ± 5.97 and 34 ± 6.72 years, respectively. The CD4 changes in women received IMOD was significant (P <0.05). A significant correlation was found between CD4 changes and age in the intervention group (P <0.05). A significant correlation was found between the mean CD4 counts before and after treatment in the intervention group (P = 0.041). A significant difference was also found between the CD4 counts before and after treatment in the intervention group (P = 0.003). There was no significant difference between the mean TLC before and after treatment in the intervention group (P = 0.938).
Conclusion: According to the results, IMOD can be included in the drug regimen of HIV-positive patients or those with AIDS to enhance the immunological status.
