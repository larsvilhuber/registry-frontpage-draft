abstract: "We leverage a field experiment in Malawi (n=1,500) to study the impact of women’s smartphone ownership on individual and household economic well-being. We compare the effects of providing women non-phone owners with cost-free smartphones, a SIM card, and smartphone training (n=400) to a cash placebo group (n=400), in which individuals receive an unconditional cash grant the equivalent value of the smartphones (roughly $70 USD) upon program enrollment, and a pure control (n=300). A fourth treatment arm (n=400) tests the efficacy of providing cost-free smartphones to women participants combined with couples training (that includes the spouses of participants) intended to strengthen respect of women’s property rights over the smartphone and community recognition and enforcement of those rights. While we expect both smartphone treatments will catalyze technical efficacy in terms of increased smartphone use across a range of capabilities (mobile communications, mobile money use, mobile internet, and social media) leading to improved economic livelihoods and, ultimately, downstream effects on women’s empowerment, we hypothesize the strongest effects to be in the couples’ training group as stronger property rights boost women’s retention and control over the smartphones leading to larger increases in individual and household economic well-being and women’s empowerment."
