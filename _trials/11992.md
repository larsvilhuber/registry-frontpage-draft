abstract: "This study delves into the behavioral biases in risk aversion measurements, specifically focusing on differences by gender. Using online platforms like MTurk and Prolific, we aim to gather insights from participants across the United States, Denmark, and India. By presenting them with a series of investment choices and lottery options, we seek to understand the underlying factors that might influence their decisions. An added layer of the experiment involves priming participants with thoughts of authority figures, and assessing if this alters their risk preferences. The overarching goal is to investigate if there is a systematic mismeasurement in risk preferences based on gender and if societal norms across different geographies accentuate this potential discrepancy. The outcomes of this study can provide valuable insights into gender gaps in financial decision-making and inform future policies to address these disparities."
