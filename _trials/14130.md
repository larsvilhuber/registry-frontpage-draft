abstract: "Previous studies have empirically examined preferences for foreign workers. A concern for accepting immigrants is that it may
increase welfare expenditures; that is, immigrants could be a burden for the welfare states. This may change what types of immigrants are preferred by citizens. The objective of this study is to test this hypothesis rigorously by conducting a conjoint survey experiment in Japan."
