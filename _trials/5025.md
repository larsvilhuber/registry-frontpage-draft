abstract: "The study examines the effectiveness of nutrition-related nudges among primary school students using a lab-in-the-field food choice experiment in urban Indonesia. The rapid economic development of Indonesia is accompanied with important changes in lifestyles and diets. The shift of people’s dietary consumption towards processed foods dense in calories, fat, and sugar is accompanied by reduced intake of fruits and vegetables. Especially for children, this nutrition transition may have long-term consequences of an increased risk of non-communicable diseases. 

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of simple nudges to encourage children’s healthier food choices, and to examine how such effects vary depending on the information environment. Specifically, we will study how nudges work with and without prior exposure to educational messages about healthy eating. Provision of information about healthy nutrition is a cornerstone of many interventions to improve people’s diets. However, by themselves educational messages tend to have weak effects and so we aim to investigate their interactive effect with  nudging treatments. The study aims to inform policymakers and future studies on efficient approaches to healthy eating interventions targeted at children.
