abstract: "The study is a randomized controlled trial to test the impact of a low-cost intervention to overcome psychological constraints to female labor force participation (FLFP). While socioeconomic background, information on available jobs and job skills are important determinants of entry into the labor market (Humphrey et al 2009; Jenson, 2012); studies have shown only modest impacts of job search assistance and skills training on employment and wages (see McKenzie 2017 for a review). Further, skills training programs often suffer from low enrollment (Cheema et al., 2012, 2015) and high cost (Adhoho et al., 2014); suggesting it is time to think of new interventions that can complement traditional skills training programs to promote employment. We investigate the extent to which psychological barriers and low motivation can constrain FLFP. We use light-touch motivational nudges to raise aspirations and promote job search effort. We will measure effort through a series of input and effort measures among female college students. "
