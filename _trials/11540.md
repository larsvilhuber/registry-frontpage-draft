abstract: "We explore how DEI statements impact college students. We send 3,825 students an invitation to an academic success session in the week prior to their first semester of college classes. This is a crucial moment for identity formation, since students are entering a new environment, where they must form beliefs about social interactions on their own, away from their families for the first time. In the invitation, we randomize whether a DEI statement is included, as well as the content of the DEI statement. Weeks later, we follow up with a survey on identity, beliefs about academic performance, and peer interactions. We also link their information to their academic records to examine the impact of DEI statements on course choices, major declarations, and academic performance at the conclusion of the first academic year."
