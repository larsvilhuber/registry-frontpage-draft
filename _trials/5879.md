abstract: "Low-income households in developing countries often lack the financial tools to deal with shocks. Imperfect credit and insurance markets, highly vulnerable income sources, limited savings, and a lack of adequate safety nets to fall back on, make these households disproportionately vulnerable to aggregate shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Empirical evidence suggests that access to formal financial services can help households to become better equipped to deal with these shocks when they occur.
In this research, we will look into the impact of access to microfinance on households’ ability to mitigate, adapt to and recover from shocks. The data will be collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will survey a sample of 2,035 female entrepreneurs in rural Paraguay and 2,711 farmers and business owners in rural Myanmar. "
