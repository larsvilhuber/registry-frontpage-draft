abstract: "COVID-19 and policies to control it have resulted in widespread poverty and food insecurity as the pandemic has adversely affected employment opportunities, incomes and livelihoods of millions of households. In order to protect poor households from income-loss and inaccessibility to food supplies, the central and state governments have introduced several benefits as part of its existing welfare schemes. However, there often exists a gap between introduction and access to these publicly funded government programmes. We conduct a field experiment in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India with just over 1000 households during the COVID-19 pandemic to examine whether raising awareness about government benefits via information provision over the phone leads to improved knowledge, increased access, and greater utilization of these available benefits. We will also assess whether such interventions will be more effective if the male members are targeted vis-Ã -vis the female members of the households. We believe that this analysis will be of particular interest as understanding what works best in this situation will be essential to improving the design of policies to combat this and similar crises in the future."
