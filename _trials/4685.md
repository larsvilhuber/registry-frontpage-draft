abstract: "Motivated by the correlation between culture and incentive pay across countries, we test the hypothesis that incentive pay is more effective in individualistic cultures. To do so, we establish identical data entry firms to create experimental variation in pay packages in three countries that have similar GDP per capita but different level of individualism: Ghana, India and the Philippines. The effect of performance pay on log productivity is lowest in the least individualistic country (Ghana) and highest in the most individualistic country (India), with the Philippines falling in between. In line with the culture hypothesis, publicising individual ranks is effective in India but backfires in the Philippines."
