abstract: "Despite improvements in under-five child mortality, an estimated 6.9 million children die from preventable diseases worldwide every year. A majority of these deaths occur in the poorest countries in the world, in areas within countries of underserved populations with inadequate access to basic health services. An increasingly common approach to reach these populations has been Community Health Worker (CHW) programs. However, a systematic review of the evidence indicates mixed results of this approach in reducing child mortality. Whether alternative, financially sustainable, delivery models where CHWs earn a margin on product sales and small performance-based incentives can provide a solution is an open question. In this project, we study a community health worker program in Uganda – the community health promoter (CHP) program – where, in contrast to traditional volunteer-based community health workers, community health promoters operate as micro-entrepreneurs earning an income on the sale of preventive and curative products to keep them motivated and active in the community.
