abstract: "The studies of altruism so far mostly concentrated on middle or higher middle incomes, neglecting the poor, although the lowest income groups are often shown to contribute large shares of their income to charitable causes. In a large-scale natural field experiment with clients of a micro-lending company in Kyrgyzstan, we study charitable giving by the poor. Our subjects own, on average, a debt equal to a monthly salary.  In a 2x2 design, we set to understand the following: How do they respond to a fundraising campaign that collects money for local projects? How do they react to price incentives, that is matching of donations?"
