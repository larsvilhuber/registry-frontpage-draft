abstract: "The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed working from home from a rarity to a widely adopted job amenity that reduces exposure to the virus and changes the organization of work. Our project aims to assess firms’ preferences towards working from home. It will evaluate to what extent these preferences depend on subjective and objective assessments of COVID-19 related risks, and to what extent on individual and firm characteristics. To this aim, we will conduct a discrete choice experiment to estimate employers’ willingness to pay for a job amenity – working from home.

The project will contribute to the understanding of social behavior, especially regarding the organization of work and firms’ hiring practices during a pandemic and its aftermath. 

This project is a follow-up of the research in which we investigated workers' preferences to work from home (RCT ID: AEARCTR-0007373). Within this research, we will investigate the employers’ preferences.
