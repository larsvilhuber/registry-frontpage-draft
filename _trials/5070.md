abstract: "In a laboratory experiment, we test the effect of (different types of) norms (injunctive or descriptive) on behavior of decision makers and potential punishers in a take-frame-laboratory-dictator-game experiment. First, the dictators (or workers) take part in a real-effort task that generates 6 € for a charitable organization. Afterwards, the dictators can choose how much of the 6 € they want to take for themselves as wage. Then, the punishers can choose to costly punish the behavior of the dictators.

We manipulate the corresponding (injunctive or descriptive) norm regarding appropriate/usual behavior of dictators by making use of the scale manipulation technique that provides subtle information regarding the perceived actual norm and is particularly effective in presence of uncertainty. 

To manipulate norm beliefs, we make decision makers and punishers submit their belief regarding the (injunctive and descriptive) norm regarding behavior. Importantly, they do so either on a scale that implies a pro-social norm (taking little) and/or an egoism norm (taking much).
