abstract: "Prisoners are often stigmatized by the society which may hinder their reintegration and eventually increase the probability of recidivism. In this study, we will explore how stigmatization affects behavior of prisoners. It will be explored using two types variations: (i) a light-touch intervention called self-affirmation, and (ii) varying the provision of the knowledge of imprisonment to the person interacting with prisoners in an economic game. Our results may shed light if the prisoners feel stigmatized and above all if a small intervention may reverse the effects of stigmatization. Second, the behavior of general population towards prisoners will be examined."
