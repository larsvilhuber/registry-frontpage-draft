abstract: "This study investigates how financial and prosocial incentives affect the walking behavior of citizens. In particular, we focus on whether they can self-select the incentive that is more effective in increasing their own number of walking steps. In addition to a control group, our field experiment has three treatment groups: two groups that are assigned to a mandatory program with either monetary or prosocial incentives, and one group that is allowed to choose which program to participate in. Our analysis reveals how effectively self-selection works."
