abstract: "How firms set their prices and how their inflation expectations relate to this is a key question for economic policy and to understand the inner workings of the firm. In times of high inflation and uncertainty about the future development of prices, it is of interest which information firms and their decision-makers consider when deciding on their price setting strategy as firms directly influence inflation dynamics via their pricing decision. Given a potential level of misperception, we study how the expected development of these variables differs from official statistics and how these expectations influence planned price setting decisions of firms. Moreover, this study is the first to measure a sufficient statistic that shows whether the Calvo or the Taylor pricing model is in line with the evidence and allows to quantify inflation “overshooting”."
