abstract: "Smallholder farmers are beset by an interlocking set of market failures, and when credit and insurance markets are missing farmers can become trapped in a low-investment equilibrium.  Risk-driven reluctance to invest in inputs such as fertilizer and improved seeds may be largely responsible for the fact that Africa has not undergone a ‘green revolution’.  The obvious policy intervention to protect farmers against such risks would appear to be insurance indexed to local weather conditions, but when such products have been introduced in the field they have typically been met by surprisingly low uptake.  This project seeks to test whether a simultaneous provision of credit and insurance can solve this puzzle, thereby using innovation in financial services to spur a meaningful expansion of the use of agricultural technology.

We are providing insured credit to smallholder farmers in Ethiopia.  Rather than addressing only a credit constraint (in which case risk rationing can remain a barrier) or insurance failures (which reverse the time-inconsistency problem and ask farmers to pay now in faith of a future benefit), we will test a form of rural credit that is interlinked with weather index insurance, in the sense that the latter will provide a collateral substitute.  To this end, we have implemented a two-armed randomized trial in collaboration with Ethiopia’s largest private-sector bank and largest private insurance company.  One arm offers a standalone index insurance product, and the other arm offers state-contingent loans, interlinking the provision of insurance with the provision of credit.
