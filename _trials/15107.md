abstract: "The proposed study investigates the emergence of (unarmed) peace and investments in arms in a guns-vs-butter conflict setting. We extend the conflict game by a novel feature, separating investment in arms from the decision to start a conflict, following the theoretical framework of Garfinkel & Syropoulos (2021). Based on this model we experimentally test the emergence of peace while varying the ability of players to reduce existing inequalities. Participants play a two-player guns-vs-butter conflict game, where one player (the advantaged) starts with more resources than the other player (the disadvantaged). In one experimental condition, they can transfer parts of their endowment before the conflict game (TRANSFER), while they cannot do so in the other (NoTRANSFER)."
