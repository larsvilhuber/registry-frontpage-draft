abstract: "A long economic literature has explored the profound impact of hiring discrimination on race gaps in labor outcomes (Charles 2008). In Colombia, this bias also contributes to the employment and salary gaps between Afro- and Non-Afro-descendant Colombians
(Rodriguez et al., 2013). The objective of this study is not to measure discrimination per se, but to measure the impact of a low-cost intervention provided to service providers in public employment services. The study aims to measure whether providing feedback to job-counselors on their implicit racial bias changes their behavior with respect to activities aimed at promoting employment, as measured by referrals and placements of Afro-descendant clients as well as through a task-based experiment that simulates their work duties."
