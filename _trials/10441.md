abstract: "A growing body of research has investigated the lack of support among the citizenry as a bottleneck for more ambitious climate policy. Yet, previous research has almost exclusively focussed on support for carbon taxes. However, nearly half of all existing carbon pricing initiatives are emissions trading systems (ETS). In this study, we conduct an online stated-choice experiment in a sample of seven European countries (France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom)  to investigate how citizens perceive the economic and non-economic properties of carbon taxes and ETS. We further analyse how trust, world views and beliefs about the role of different actors (i.e., government, consumers, and companies) in the transition to a climate-friendly economy shape support for both instruments. Our study has the potential to shed new light on the classic environmental economics debate regarding the relative merit of regulation by “prices vs. quantities” by framing the instrument choice from the perspective of securing sufficient public support.
