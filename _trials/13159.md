abstract: "We will study how beliefs affect behavior in common-value auctions. These are auctions in which all buyers have the same value for an object or set of objects (e.g. an oil field), but this value is unknown ex-ante and each buyer receives a different signal about the value. We will study how different incentive structures interact with the information subjects receive using an incentivized laboratory experiment."
