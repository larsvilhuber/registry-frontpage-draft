abstract: "Across Africa and other parts of the world past events of political violence continue to harass people. From West Africa to East Africa to South Africa, the threat or legacy of political violence presents an ominous and disconcerting issue for many people. The legacy and thus threat of political violence is a constant presence in people's lives.  In this analysis, we will test the effect of elections on outcomes related to wellbeing, identity (ethnic vs. national), and the degree to which people think political violence is a problem.  There are two parts to this project: (i) a survey experiment in which people will be treated with a question about if the upcoming Nigerian presidential election on Feb 25, 2023, and (ii) the timing of that election.  All of the outcomes are the same across the two projects and include their views on political violence, their wellbeing, and their ethnic versus national identity.  We expect that those respondents randomly assigned a treatment about elections and the possibility that they pose problems
