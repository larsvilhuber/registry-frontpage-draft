abstract: "This is a classroom experiment aiming at replicating findings underlying historical developments that have triggered the development of descriptive models of decision making. In particular, we aim to replicate patterns underlying Markowitz-expected utility, Dual-expected utility and prospect theory. We further aim to test parametric fittings of these models against each-other, in order to assess and quantify the relative costs of using the simplifications underlying the simpler models conditional on subsets of data used. An additional purpose of this paper is to test the feasibility and implications of pre-registering hypotheses and an analysis plan for laboratory and classroom experiments."
