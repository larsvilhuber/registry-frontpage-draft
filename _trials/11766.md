abstract: "Reducing Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation is a pressing issue if the Paris climate target is to be achieved (Gota et al., 2019; Jackson et al., 2019). Global transportation accounts for 25% of global CO2 emissions (IEA, 2021). While GHG emissions from transpor-tation decreased in the last few years due to the pandemic, it is again on an upward trend (Liu et al., 2020, 2022). Different from other sectors, GHG reduction in the transport sector is heavily dependent on behavioural changes (L. P. Fesenfeld et al., 2022); as a result, motivat-ing individuals to reduce their mobility emissions plays an important role in the reduction of overall transport emissions. 
Shifting mobility patterns towards low-carbon modes of transportation is a challenging en-deavour. A large body of literature investigates the various internal and external factors influ-encing mobility choices (Anable, 2005; Daramy-Williams et al., 2019; Dütschke et al., 2022; Kowald et al., 2017). An essential question in this regard is how individual mobility behaviour can be steered towards low-carbon modes of transportation. A prominent role in the literature plays information and incentives and how they might impact decisions on the individual mode of transportation (Bothos et al., 2014; Brazil & Caulfield, 2013; Cellina et al., 2019; Eriksson et al., 2008; Geng et al., 2020; Parvaneh et al., 2014; Semanjski et al., 2016).
Different studies investigate the role of incentives (Bamberg & Schmidt, 2001; Castellanos, 2016; Daniel et al., 2022) and the role of personalized mobility information (Bothos et al., 2014; Cellina et al., 2019; Semanjski et al., 2016) in the field of mobility behaviour. This cur-rent study adds to the literature by investigating a publicly available mobility-tracking app, the Swiss Climate Challenge App, combining personalized information feedback with incentives and gamification elements. In this combination following suggestions for effective application design for changing mobility behaviour (Andersson et al., 2018). The gamification of the per-sonalised information on the one hand, holds the advantage of making the information more accessible through the creation of heightened attention and the reduction of complexity (Au-bert et al., 2018). 
Through the combination of real-world behavioural data and surveys, the study allows for a detailed assessment of the impact that gamified individual mobility information and incen-tives have on mobility-related attitudes, norms, beliefs, behavioural intentions, and actual mo-bility behaviour. 
We base our investigation on the Theory of planned behaviour (Ajzen, 1991), the Technology Acceptance Model (Davis, 1989; Chen & Chao, 2011) and insights form the Theory of behav-ioural Spillover Theory (Noblet & McCoy, 2018; Truelove et al., 2014). In line with this theo-retical foundation our dependent variables are participants’ attitudes, perceived social norms, behavioural control, behavioural intentions, and actual mobility behaviour. Further we investi-gate the impact of the App usage on support for mobility policies promoting sustainable modes of transportation and support of climate-mitigation policies more broadly over different sectors.
We conduct a large-scale randomised field experiment with a targeted sample of 3000 Swiss citizens. We collaborate with Swisscom, Switzerland’s largest telecommunication provider and evaluate their Swiss Climate Challenge App. The Swiss Climate Challenge App is a mo-bility-tracking app, which gives the users feedback about their used modes of transportation and the emitted emissions from their mobility behaviour. It further provides the users with reduction challenges for the completion of which the users can earn “Green Points”. The Green Points can be used to support climate-mitigation projects in Switzerland. The experi-ment takes place over the course of six months. For the experiment the respondents will be randomly assigned to either the treatment or the control group. The treatment group will use the Swiss Climate Challenge App, thus receiving information about their mobility emissions and incentives for the reduction of the emissions. The control group will use a similar mobility-tracking application but will not receive any feedback on their mobility during the experiment and will not be presented with incentives for reducing mobility emissions. Through the mobili-ty-tracking applications data on the actual mobility behaviour and the resulting emissions for the participants will be available over the time of the study. This data allows us to compare treatment effects for both stated and revealed preferences and behavioural choices. During the experiment four survey waves are conducted. With the surveys, various self-stated mobility attitudes, perceived behavioural control, norms, behavioural intentions, social-demographic and control variables will be elicited. Further, two survey experiments will be integrated into the surveys testing belief updating and policy spillover effects. 
Overall, the findings from this study will help to have a clearer picture of what types of sus-tainability-related information are effective in influencing attitudes, norms, and behaviours. Especially the effectiveness of gamified personalised information and the provision of incen-tives are investigated. Moreover, the findings of this large-scale field experiment will reveal what kinds of mobility policies are supported, especially when people have more information on personal mobility-related carbon emissions. Lastly, the findings and the resulting policy implications can be helpful in future climate- and sustainability-related mobility information initiatives.
