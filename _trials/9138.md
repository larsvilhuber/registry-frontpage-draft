abstract: "We aim to understand whether providing different types of information on credit card debt affect repayment behaviour. Specifically, we will examine the effect of reporting the minimum required payment and the effect of reporting information on the length of time and the amount of total interest accrued based on the participants' chosen credit card payment."
