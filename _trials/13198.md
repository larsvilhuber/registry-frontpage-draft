abstract: "This pre-analysis plan describes a pilot study for two experiments that we field on the online job platform Path2Work. The platform is specifically designed for this study and is targeted at refugees in Switzerland. The project aims to investigate the hurdles refugees face in finding employment and to gauge the potential of digital platforms in facilitating refugees’ economic integration. The main purpose of this pilot study is to estimate take-up rates and the number of companies posting vacancies relevant to our target group. "
