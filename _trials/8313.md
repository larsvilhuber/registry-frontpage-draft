abstract: "This study investigates the role of information frictions in explaining why jobseekers do not fill understaffed jobs. To do so, we design a low-cost informational intervention in cooperation with a Public Employment Service in Belgium. The intervention aims at addressing potential information frictions faced by jobseekers when making decisions about training. Specifically, the intervention consists in communicating, to a random subset of recent UI recipients, information on the advantages of following a training (and searching for a job) in a shortage occupation. We then study whether directly providing this information to jobseekers by email has an impact on their likelihood of following a training in (and ultimately entering) a shortage occupation."
