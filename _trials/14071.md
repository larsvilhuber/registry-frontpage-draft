abstract: "This study aims to explore how the introduction of AI as an employee within an organization will affect managers' evaluation of other employees and their ultimate decision-making. More specifically, our research scenario involves scoring creative works. We plan to have two  experimental groups. In Group1, only the initial evaluation scores, i.e., the average score given during the preliminary evaluation by subordinate employees are provided to managers. In Group2, both AI scores and the initial evaluation scores are provided. We will observe the final score given by managers and their decision time. The scoring involves three dimensions: target and difficulty; creativity and execution; and outcome. We will analyze the heterogeneity impacts of providing AI score by the above dimensions. This study will provide implications on how managers (experts) react to AI, with a focus on creativity industry.
