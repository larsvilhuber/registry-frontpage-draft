abstract: "This project aims to identify whether there is a trade-off in how individuals prefer to spread information about stigmatized services versus what is most effective at increasing message recipientsâ€™ take-up of stigmatized services. In particular, are people more willing to share information in dismissive (relative to sincere) ways, or a manner that makes their friend feel less singled out (relative to being targeted)? Is the recipient of a dismissive and/or general message less likely to choose to use the advertised services? This project studies the above questions in the context of peer referrals for a mental health phone counseling service for Syrian refugees.  "
