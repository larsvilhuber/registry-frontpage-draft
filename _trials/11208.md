abstract: "AI-based personell selection tools are efficient. However, they can generate disparities in selection rates across groups of applicants and therefore violate fairness requirements. In this project we investigate how people perceive this efficiency-fairnes tradeoffs. After having observed people's general fairness evaluation and pferences over efficient and fair algorithms, in this study we are interested in how the stakeholder perspective affects the AI perceptions in HR context. For this purpose, we compare the tradeoff perceptions by the UK managers and students in the role of job applicants. Based on the prominent fairness theory in organizational justice, we expect that managers prefer more efficient algorithms, while students favour les efficient algorithms with lower disparity rates."
