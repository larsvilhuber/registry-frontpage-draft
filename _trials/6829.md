abstract: "Field experiments improve the credibility of economic research and we observe an ever-increasing number of experiments in developing countries. These studies are often based on survey data. At the same time, research on the ethical aspects of collecting survey data in developing countries remains scarce. There is, however, a responsibility to engage with the ethical requirements of survey data collection. In this paper, we investigate informational constraints to consent of potential survey participants. First, we test whether survey participants are sufficiently informed about what happens to their data and their rights. Further, we experimentally test whether an interactive, audio-visual supported approach can improve how well informed they are. In this approach, the content of the consent form is presented in a structured dialog and illustrated with a short video. We further investigate implications on response behavior and data quality."
