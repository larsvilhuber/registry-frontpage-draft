abstract: "In a panel survey of online firms, we find that the ability to correctly forecast sales is highly correlated with firm performance. Despite its apparent importance, firms are remarkably bad at forming accurate predictions â€“ if firms simply accurately reported their sales over the past 3-months as their prediction they would perform twice as well. We posit that simply encouraging them to review the financial data already easily available to them would dramatically improve their prediction performance. We aim to run an RCT testing exactly that and show a causal pathway from monitoring business financials to prediction performance."
