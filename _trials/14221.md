abstract: "This project investigates the role of gendered stereotypes about STEM in perpetuating gender gaps in college major choice. We will study a population of undergraduate students at a large research university. To measure implicit gender stereotypes, we will administer a gender-science Implicit Association Test (IAT). We will combine IAT results with administrative transcript data and with original survey data to measure outcomes such as STEM course-taking, intended and declared major, and academic performance. To obtain causal evidence, we will administer an experimental treatment to assess how much college studentsâ€™ gender stereotypes can be altered and how their observed, real-world academic choices (e.g., major selection) are affected as a result. Specifically, we will show a random subset of students their IAT results, making implicit stereotypes explicit. All students will take the IAT a second time, so we can observe whether and how implicit stereotypes are altered by the treatment. We hypothesize that in the absence of any intervention, women (men) with stronger implicit bias against women in STEM will be less (more) likely to take courses in or declare a major in a STEM subject. We also hypothesize that students being confronted with their own unconscious biases may cause them to question those implicit associations and make academic choices better in line with their explicit goals, thus closing gender gaps in STEM persistence."
