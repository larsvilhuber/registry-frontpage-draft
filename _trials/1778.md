abstract: "This project seeks to estimate the impacts of providing social intermediation services to poor recipients of conditional cash transfers (CCT) in the Dominican Republic (DR).  Employing a randomized control trial design, the project will randomly assign either i) referred volunteer, ii) publicly-recruited volunteer, or iii) university-recruited paid paraprofessional "community workers" to provide monthly visits to newly enrolled and existing CCT beneficiaries.  Households in one arm of the study will only receive cash transfers and will not receive home visits by community workers and an additional arm will include households that are pure controls.  Key outcomes of interest include beneficiaries' compliance with program conditionalities, household consumption, primary and secondary school attendance, use of health and other local public services, participation in vocational training, labor market participation, and knowledge of the wellness curriculum administered during the monthly household visits.  Data on these key outcomes will be collected both administratively by the DR government and through conducting midline and endline household surveys.  In addition to estimating impacts on beneficiary households, the project is designed to estimate the impacts of the community worker employment experience on community worker candidates themselves in terms of their own income, political and community engagement, leadership activities, and subjective wellbeing.  Specifically, volunteer and paid employment offers will be randomly offered among those community worker candidates screened into the selection process.  "
