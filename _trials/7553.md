abstract: "Despite the existence of experimental works studying the impact of cognitive load on individuals' risk attitudes and patience in intertemporal choices, no attention has been paid to the analysis of the effect of cognitive load on individual financial decisions. Yet, such decisions have grown progressively more complex and important, in view of financial innovation and increasing need to provide for retirement. The objective of this project is to contribute towards understanding whether cognitive load significantly influences financial decisions, with particular emphasis on how consumption, saving, and borrowing decisions are made over time; and how these influences are exacerbated or mitigated by individual characteristics, abilities, and attitudes. To do this, we run an incentivized online experiment to study individuals' consumption and borrowing decisions in the context of a life-cycle model. Starting from a benchmark with no cognitive load, we will be comparing how peopleâ€™s financial behavior responds to being faced with cognitive load. As we want to quantify the importance of this load, we also introduce other two treatments that allow to compare the financial responses that arise from the presence of the load, with those that arise from a negative income shock, as well as those that arise from a combination of the load and the economic shock. Finally, by collecting information on individual characteristics (from socio-demographics to personality traits and cognitive abilities), the outcome of our planned project can shed light on what types of people are in greater need of help through information, advice, transfers and tax incentives, nudging and debt counselling, and suitable financial products."
