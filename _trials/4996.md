abstract: "This project aims to design cost-effective audit mechanisms, taking into consideration the EPA's limited audit resources. To do so, we first unify in a theoretical framework with endogenous emissions and emission reports several recent advances on competitive audit mechanisms for the enforcement of environmental taxes. We then experimentally assess the effectiveness of competitive audit mechanisms relative to random audit mechanisms in terms of emissions produced and emissions reported. While random auditing assigns the same audit probability to each regulated firm, competitive audit mechanisms assign a lower audit probability to the firms with higher self-reported emissions relative to others.  These resulting strategic interdependences between firms can yield audit leverage for the environmental protection agency. Hence, the performance of competitive audits depends in part on the inter-firm information structure. When firms have no information about each other’s emissions, our model predicts that competitive auditing induces higher reported emissions and the same level of actual emissions as compared to random auditing. These two results are isomorph to the main findings by Gilpatric et al. (2011) and Cason et al. (2016) respectively. In contrast, when firms have perfect information about each other’s emissions, competitive auditing should induce the socially optimal level of emission, while this is not feasible under the random audit mechanism. This result is isomorph to the main finding by Oestreich (2017). In the experiment, we also extend the model to the case where firms have limited information about each other’s emissions."
