abstract: "A list experiment is designed to shield respondents from social desirability pressures in reporting in 2015 whether they voted for Vladimir Putin in the Russian Federation's 2012 presidential election. It is to be used to generate an estimate of the share of the population that sincerely recalls in 2015 having voted for Putin in 2012."
