abstract: "Traditional explanations of Americansâ€™ conspiracy beliefs by motivated reasoning like partisanship and ideology may mask other stronger motives in their conspiratorial beliefs about international politics. I navigate my research to the effect of negative emotions and perceived foreign threats on Americans' conspiracy beliefs about international relations, hypothesizing that the negative emotions and foreign threats perceived by Americans are significant motivators for their beliefs in conspiracy theories related to global affairs. The prior attitude held towards specific countries leads respondents to be more inclined to believe in conspiratorial statements associated with those countries. This research initially conducted an observational study using the American National Election Survey (ANES) 2020 Time Series to examine the correlation between self-reported emotions, attitudes about international politics, and conspiracy theory beliefs. Then, the observational results were used to guide the design of an original survey experiment to test causality. This research demonstrates how the perception of negative emotions and foreign threats shape Americans' conspiracy beliefs in international politics.
