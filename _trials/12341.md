abstract: "In partnership with the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, we will conduct a randomized control trial of an outreach strategy to connect newly-enrolled MaineCare members with primary care. Members of MaineCare (Maineâ€™s Medicaid program) enrolled in the Primary Care Case Management (PCCM) program will comprise the study sample. Those in the treatment arm will receive the standard outreach packet PLUS a simplified mailer packet that emphasizes the importance of value and low-cost of a check-up and recommends a single primary care provider near the enrollee's home. A write-in field is provided for enrollees to opt out of the assigned primary care provider if they already have a preferred provider. The control arm receive the standard state outreach packet only. Our team will examine whether the use of a simplified enrollment packet with an assigned PCP results in an increase in primary care visits, receipt of preventive services, and improved quality of care, and a decrease in emergency-department utilization and hospitalizations. All evaluations will be conducted using MaineCare enrollment and administrative health care claims."
