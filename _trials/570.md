abstract: "This study is a randomized impact evaluation of JEEViKA, the flagship rural poverty reduction program of the State of Bihar. The primary goal of JEEViKA is to promote socio-economic inclusion of impoverished rural households by mobilizing women into self-help groups (SHGs). SHG members meet regularly to participate in savings, borrowing and repayments; additionally, the group provides an opportunity for 10-15 women of similar backgrounds to come together and discuss their day-to-day lives. Each SHG member is required to deposit 10-20 cents in a joint account weekly; once sufficient equity is established, members may begin drawing credit from this pool. After some weeks or months of demonstrated group savings, JEEViKA provides the SHG with a one-time grant of 900 USD, which the SHG may disburse as loans to its members. JEEViKA then links SHGs to banks in order to leverage funds from formal credit institutions. The annual cost of credit to SHG members through the program is 24%, well below rates charged by informal creditors in the study setting. The primary outcomes of the evaluation are households' financial position at endline (value of high-cost debt held; average interest rate on household debt; asset position), and indicators of women's autonomy, decision-making role within the household, and propensity to engage in collective action.
