abstract: "We investigate the effect of media information processing on policy preferences in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. For that purpose, we conduct a survey experiment to study the event of the publication of a highly regarded annual report about the state of the economy in Germany. In our experiment, individuals are exposed to information on a key economic statistic covered in the report which differs in terms of its medial framing. This design allows us to disentangle effects which are related to the original press released information and its coverage in newspaper articles. Our examination accounts for public evaluation of economic policy in general as well as important subdomains. We aim to inform about policy implications on the relationship between media coverage, belief updating and public opinion formation in times of economic recession and pronounced public interest in statistical reporting."
