abstract: "Research on students’ attitudes towards online teaching is a vital factor in predicting market changes, due to the increasing prevalence of online teaching in higher education. Still, there is little research on this topic in economics. Moreover, studies across the social sciences seldomly apply experimental methods to elicit such attitudes, instead relying and small samples prone to selection bias. This pre-analysis plan describes a survey experiment designed to overcome the methodological shortcomings of the existing literature, and an important knowledge gap by shedding light on students’ perceptions of online teaching on their own motivation and learning outcomes. The plan includes motivation, and information about the conduction of the survey, about the implementation of the experiment, hypotheses, power tests and exploratory analyses. The survey was launched in mid-March 2023 and is administered by the Norwegian Agency for Quality Assurance in Education (NOKUT). The data collection period is scheduled to end in late April. We expect to receive the dataset in the end of April/beginning of May."
