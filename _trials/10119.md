abstract: "The purpose of the research is to understand how people consume information from an online places business profile page while choosing a place to dine or drink at. By manipulating specific components of a digital store front, the study aims to understand the marginal influence of each on consumers' subsequent willingness to visit the business and associated perceptions of value, expectations of the experience, and other related outcomes."
