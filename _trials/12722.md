abstract: "Sustainable land management (SLM) technologies are widely promoted as strategies to enhance resilience against adverse climatic and environmental conditions by improving soil fertility and water retention, reducing erosion, and storing additional carbon in the soil. In Ethiopia, policy interest in enhancing sustainable land management is high, but take-up of SLM practices remains low. The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate a bundled intervention providing training and inputs (tree seedlings and vegetable gardening inputs) to encourage rural Ethiopian households who are part of the Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) to adopt three complementary SLM practices: tree planting, composting, and home gardening. As women’s adoption of climate adaptation strategies may be more limited due to reduced labor availability, limited access to inputs, informational barriers, and restrictive social norms, we also seek to evaluate two different targeting strategies - training women alone, or training couples jointly - designed to encourage women’s participation in the decision-making around and implementation of sustainable land management technologies. Comparing the relative impacts of the two treatment arms allows us to test whether men’s engagement increases the probability of adopting SLM practices and of incurring any benefits, and whether this engagement affects patterns of intra-household task sharing and equality in decision-making. We aim to measure whether there is heterogeneity in adoption based on households' baseline level of spousal cooperation, perception of climate risks, and time and risk preferences.
