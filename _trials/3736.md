abstract: "New York City requires all 8th grade students to engage in a school choice process to be assigned to a high school through a centralized assignment mechanism. The admissions process is complex and cognitively demanding, requiring students to select among schools with different screening methods, curricular themes, and admissions preferences. To test the potential of information to help students navigate the process, we fielded a series of informational interventions in a school-level randomized controlled trial. The initial year of our study tested the effect of a paper-based informational tool – a list of relatively high-performing high schools -- in a school-level RCT of 165 high-poverty New York City middle schools (Corcoran, Jennings, Cohodes, and Sattin-Bajaj, 2018). We found that access to the informational tool increased applications to listed schools and decreased the likelihood that students attend a high school with a graduation rate below 70%. 

We extended this project for an additional two years as an school-level RCT, which expanded the number of schools served to over 450 and the types of interventions offered to include a variety of technological innovations. We contrast a paper and a digital version of a curated list of schools, a guided search tool, and a directory search tool to a control group. School personnel received the intervention tools to distribute via mail, along with supportive materials (lesson plans, video guides, and support from the study office), simulating the most likely mode of dissemination if a school district were to adopt such tools. This was in contrast to the prior year’s study where trained research assistants delivered materials in a lesson. In 2016-2017, schools were randomly assigned to one of three informational interventions or a control group.  In 2017-2018, we replicated the prior years random assignment to control or treatment and offered two informational interventions in the treated groups.
