abstract: "This study aims to (1) unravel the (dis)incentives for rice farmers to adopt environment-friendly agricultural practices, and (2) evaluate the impact of the adoption of such techniques on rice production. To this end, we will conduct a randomized experiment in the North-Central Province in Sri Lanka.

The interventions in this study consist of three components: (a) a training session on environment-friendly farming practices (four practices), (b) subsidies for organic fertilizers (four levels), and (c) a study session on agro-pollution and health issues. Then, we divide farmers into five groups: those who receive [T1] (a) only; [T2] (a) and (b); [T3] (a) and (c); [T4] (c) only; and [C] a typical meeting that is unrelated to environment-friendly practices or agro-pollution. We randomize the treatment status at the village level (not the household level) to eliminate the spillover effect of the interventions. For each group, we will send invitations to 280 randomly selected farmers (35 farmers from eight villages) based on a two-stage cluster sampling, and have 1,400 farmers in total."
