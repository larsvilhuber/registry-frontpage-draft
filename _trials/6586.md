abstract: "People tend to have misperceptions about many things, but particularly more so about others whom they are not familiar with, such as racial minorities and immigrants . One possible source of persistent misperceptions is that they have little incentive to search for information to correct their bias. This paper conducts a randomized controlled survey experiment to examine the effects of financial incentives to search for true information and access to true information on perceptions, policy preferences, and altruistic behavior in the context of immigrants. About 4,000 survey participants will be randomly assigned to one of equal-sized groups that receive i) financial rewards for providing correct answers, ii) access to true information, iii) both interventions, or iv) none. We will estimate their independent and joint effects of the above interventions on perceptions, preferences, and choice.
