abstract: "We randomly selected 150 of 300 rural Nepali women nominated by their local goat cooperative to be trained as a community animal health workers (CAHW). This government-sanctioned training is the only way to become a CAHW, thus the intervention amounts to a new technical career opportunity. Half of the selected candidates were randomly assigned to a traditional training course requiring 35 consecutive days away from home and half were assigned to a distance learning course requiring two shorter stays plus a tablet-based curriculum to be completed at home. We seek to answer the following three research questions: What is the impact of becoming a CAHW on candidate welfare (income, savings and empowerment), gender attitudes and aspirations? What is the impact becoming a CAHW on gender attitudes and aspirations of other household members? Is distance learning a viable method for training female CAHWs?"
