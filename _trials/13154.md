abstract: "(This PAP is for a follow up study on the previously conducted experiment pre-registered as AEARCTR-0007559)

Based on our early analysis of the data we have collected, we note that there are a few plausible reasons why we find the patterns we observe in the data.  First, different groups of people exhibit altruism towards co-ethnics, while others exhibit more altruism towards non-coethnics. The precise mechanism/reason this diverging patterns across different groups, however, remains unclear. Second, our earlier survey instruments do not provide us with a sufficiently direct measure of Singaporeansâ€™ attitudes/views about their groups. To test the specific mechanisms behind the patterns we examine in our previously collected data, we aim to collect new data and test additional hypotheses. Therefore, we run a new online survey of Singapore residents (adult Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents) with 1,300 participants.  

In particular, we aim to examine whether (a) People are more likely to exhibit altruism towards those they think deserve their help; (b)  examine whether people are more likely to exhibit altruism to their co-ethnics by means of a survey experiment with donations. 

We are also interested in understanding how Singaporeans view their government and representatives, and how this may be correlated with other attitudes.  "
