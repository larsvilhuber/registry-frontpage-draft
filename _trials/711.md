abstract: "Trade credit from suppliers is an important form financing for firms, but in developing countries it is limited due to the lack of trust and information available to lenders and poor functioning of the legal system. We are interested in understanding the barriers to trade credit access and evaluating programs that help alleviate the problem, in the setting of retail SMEs.
