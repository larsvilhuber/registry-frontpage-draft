abstract: "This project studies how providing one-time financial assistance affects housing stability. Among people who are housed, at imminent risk of homelessness, and ineligible for other similar programs in Santa Clara County, California, we randomly assign some marginal clients to receive assistance. As an outcome, we track use of homelessness services as observed in the county's Homelessness Management Information System."
