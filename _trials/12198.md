abstract: "The gig economy has led to a transformative restructuring of work organization, providing individuals with unprecedented autonomy in shaping their careers. Amidst this evolving online world of work, the exploration of women’s participation in the gig economy has become an indispensable research domain, seeking to comprehend their broader engagement in the labor market. This study aims to delve into the underlying motives that influence women’s choices to opt for the online labor market (OLM) in conjunction with or as an alternative to the traditional labor market (TLM), with a specific focus on the significance women place on temporal flexibility. Particularly, this research seeks to analyze the value of temporal flexibility and the extent to which women are willing to forgo it in favor of higher pay, effectively examining their inclination to exchange short-term benefits for long-term gains.
