abstract: "This study analyses the effect of an color-coded information treatment on undergraduate students’ performance, learning behavior, and satisfaction. As part of an introductory course at a large German university, students receive randomly either a publicly available information on required learning intensity – or on loan periods at the library. Students are then tracked over the first year of undergraduate studies including their course-specific learning effort and their exam performance. Thereby, the study ascertains whether the provision of information at an early stage can affect academic performance. "
