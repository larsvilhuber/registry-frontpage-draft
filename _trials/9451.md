abstract: "This project studies the voluntary provision of a weakest-link public good in overlapping neighborhoods. Located around a virtual table, each individual’s investment decision affects the provision of the public good of herself and her right- and left-hand neighbors. We hypothesize that the introduction of this spatial element can provide obstacles to the level at which the public good is provided and can create a dynamic to the provision level across space. We compare treatments in which the endowments are homogeneous with those where some subjects receive a large, some a low endowment. For this heterogeneous case, we specifically study how the spatial distribution of different income levels affects the investment decisions. We investigate and compare two different mechanisms through which subjects can invest at neighbors’ locations, a direct in-kind transfer system to any neighbour vs. one where subjects can contribute to a common common that is divided up among low income participants."
