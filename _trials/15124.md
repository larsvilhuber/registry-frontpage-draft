abstract: "This study investigates whether financial support can improve energy efficiency among small and medium enterprises (SMEs) across 32 eligible European countries. Using a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), we assess the impact of providing €10,000 grants to 900 SMEs to implement energy-saving solutions alongside sustainability advisory services offered by the Enterprise Europe Network (EEN). Both treated and comparison firms receive standard EEN advisory services, but only the treated firms gain access to financial support, supporting (co-)investments in energy-efficient technologies, consultancy, and training for their employees. The study is set to also examine heterogeneous effects by firm type and industry sector, exploring the mechanisms driving these outcomes. By addressing financial constraints, this research contributes to understanding pathways for Europe’s transition to a sustainable, low-carbon economy."
