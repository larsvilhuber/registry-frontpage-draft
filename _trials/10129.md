abstract: "Over the past three decades, a series of studies have shown that providing mothers in developing countries with guidance on how to offer psychosocial stimulation can improve the cognitive and social-emotional outcomes of their young children over the short- and medium-term, and in some cases, their probability of employment and wages during adulthood. However, the ways in which mother training for early stimulation has been provided, - for example, through home visits, existing social programs, and mother groups—are costly and challenging to scale. 

This study examines a cost-effective and easily scalable approach: brief audio recordings delivered to mothers by phone targetting beneficiaries of India’s public childcare system, the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS). We conduct a randomized evaluation of a program developed by an Indian non-profit (Dost Education) that provides mothers with regular audio recordings with guidance on how to offer psychosocial stimulation to children from 6 to 30 months.
