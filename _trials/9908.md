abstract: "We conduct a large-scale survey experiment among roughly 3,000 individuals in Germany. We investigate whether long-term informational and supportive interventions over a period of four months can reduce the participants' actual meat consumption. Specifically, our treatment groups receive information about the positive effects of reducing meat consumption on the climate and the environment as well as vegetarian recipes and tips for a reduction in meat consumption.
