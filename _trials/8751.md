abstract: "In this trial, we collect students' various traits, abilities and interest types. We find high discrepancy between parents’ beliefs and kids’ survey outcome on abilities and interests. We report the students' information to parents and educate parents to look beyond the test score in randomly selected classes. We expect that parents can update their beliefs on children and reoptimize their investments by taking into account of students' interests and abilities.
