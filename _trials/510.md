abstract: "In this study, we intend to set up a randomized control trial to assess the real impact of financial inclusion on the poor’s lives in Italy, as well as the relative importance of safety, flexibility, financial returns and commitment features in addressing the poor population’s untapped financial demand. 
Our experiment allows us to test for the demand, use and impact of different savings vehicles targeted at the poor and immigrant population: basic current accounts with and without fees, as well as savings accounts with and without (soft) commitment."
