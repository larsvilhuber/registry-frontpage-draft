abstract: "The Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) is a program by the government of Sindh that aims to vaccinate 0-23 months of age children against 11 Vaccine Preventable Diseases (VPDs). All EPI vaccinators currently use ZM Electronic Immunization Registry (ZM-EIR) across Sindh to enroll and track immunizations of children. To improve the immunization coverage of children in Sindh, it has introduced mobile phone-based conditional cash transfers (mCCTs) and plans to roll this out to 7 high-risk districts in the province. IRD is the monitoring partner of the program and will be accessing and providing descriptive analysis of this data. IRD has a MOU with the government of Sindh on the usage of this data."
