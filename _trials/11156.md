abstract: "Finding cost-efficient ways to increase healthy eating in low-income communities is a pressing global challenge. Our study aims to reduce junk food consumption and increase protein-rich food consumption in a low-income settlement in Mumbai, India, by providing information messages. In a randomized field experiment, we send WhatsApp-based informational videos and observe the recipients' real shopping transactions by deploying scanner devices in local groceries. To examine what information works, we randomly manipulate the content of the video messages. The first arm receives informative videos emphasizing the health benefits of a nutritious diet, the second arm receives a similar video emphasizing the benefits in terms of economic success and performance, the third arm receives placebo (neutral) videos, and the fourth arm receives no messages.
