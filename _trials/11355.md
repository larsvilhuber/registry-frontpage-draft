abstract: "Mexico is a pluricultural country where different ethnic groups coexist. Minority groups such as Afro-Mexican and indigenous communities live in a situation of structural inequality and violence where their basic rights are constantly violated. In this project, we aim to understand whether such unequal attitudes to different ethnic groups in a society lead to any effects already at an early age. The main research question is to investigate the impact of ethnic identity on self-esteem of children in the indigenous communities. The field experiment is conducted in three indigenous communities in Oaxaca, Mexico enrolling a sample of about 450 children. The experiment is inspired by the doll test performed by Mamie P. Clark and Kenneth B. Clark in 1940 but the dolls differ in the style of clothes: indigenous versus modern ones. The accompanying short survey includes additional questions to measure ethnic preferences, ethnic identity and self-esteem. Additional information on the rich history and traditions of the respective community will be presented to the children in the treatment arm. The randomization is done at the individual level within each class. The study aims to provide additional insights on whether ethnic identity might influence self-esteem at an early age in ethnically unequal societies."
