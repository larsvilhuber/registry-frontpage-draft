abstract: "This project builds on previous studies conducted in 2021 and 2023 on Code in Place, an online programming course where we found that automated feedback to instructors can improve their instruction and student satisfaction. The current study was conducted in the spring of 2024 on the Schoolhouse.world platform, and its goal is to understand whether providing feedback to students as well, in addition to providing feedback to instructors, influences the quality of their discourse and student outcomes. Feedback to teachers is known to be an effective way to improve their instruction, but few empirical studies have examined the effect of joint feedback to both teachers and students. To answer this question, the study leverages a randomized controlled trial design and computational natural language processing techniques. "
