abstract: "I conduct a natural field experiment that leverages a feature that allows Twitter users to report content that violates the terms of service. I gather a daily sample of users that post hate speech and randomly report half of them for violating the rules against hateful conduct. The main outcomes of interest correspond to the time spent on the platform, the type of content posted and spillovers to other users.
