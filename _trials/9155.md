abstract: "Digital technologies have spread rapidly in much of the world. Despite their expected impacts on productivity and growth, rates of adoption remain modest among firms in sub-Saharan Africa. This research will evaluate the impact of digital payments on business activity, and investigate the role of information asymmetry within firms in explaining businessesâ€™ resistance to technology adoption. By mitigating moral hazard, digital technologies enable changes in the contracting space between employers and employees, in ways that may constitute a barrier to their adoption. To study these questions, I will conduct a randomized experiment by introducing digital payment technologies into widespread small businesses, taxis. In collaboration with a large mobile money company, I will test options for digitizing payments and evaluate the impact of digital payment technologies in the informal transit sector."
