abstract: "With the termination of Cost-Sharing Reduction (CSR) subsidies in 2017, many individuals in California's ACA Marketplace became eligible for $1 plans. But not all individuals eligible for $1 plans select the most generous coverage option for which they're eligible, thereby enrolling in a low actuarial value plan when a higher actuarial value plan is available for the same (or lower) price.

This project's goal is to examine whether an informational email can increase $1 CSR Silver take-up among Covered California households enrolled in Bronze, Gold or Platinum plans for the 2021 coverage year. 

Choice errors are common across different health insurance markets--including Medicare, employer-sponsored insurance and the ACA Marketplaces--and thus identifying ways to improve choice quality is of interest to policymakers both in California and nationwide."
