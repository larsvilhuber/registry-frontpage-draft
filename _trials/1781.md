abstract: "We study the effect of distressed debt restructuring on consumer spending, default and welfare. We first design and implement a large scale randomized trial at a large retail bank in which we deliberately vary the interest rate, the amount of temporary payment reductions, and the maturity of restructured loans. This allows us to disentangle the effects of liquidity and present-value debt reductions on spending and defaults at various horizons. We use our empirical findings to calibrate the parameters of an intertemporal model of consumption that includes a default option. We use the model to study the optimal form of debt renegotiation, and the role of debt relief in aggregate stabilization policy. "
