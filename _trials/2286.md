abstract: "Our research seeks to understand the impact of increasing workersâ€™ input and participation in decision-making within a firm on outcomes, including productivity, retention and well-being. We are working with an automobile manufacturing firm in China on a set of randomized field experiments with production line workers and their managers. We propose two experimental designs. The first looks at the effects of empowering workers by giving them more choice in determining their own compensation scheme. The second experiment looks at managerial compensation and its intersection with giving workers more voice in that process.
