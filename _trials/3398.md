abstract: "Although it has been established that sales from businesses to consumers provide fertile ground for collaborative tax evasion, little is known about the genesis of this phenomenon. We conduct a natural field experiment with 2,900 businesses operating on two German online markets. We advertise small-scale jobs and randomly manipulate the contract conditions. We find that 56% of businesses approach consumers with the intention to evade. The fraction is zero in the regulated market and 72% in the unregulated market. It increases when consumers signal their willingness to collude. Consumers' can save 25% of the legal price on average if they agree to evade. "
