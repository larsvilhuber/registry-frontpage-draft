abstract: "Matching of charitable contributions is a commonly used tactic in non-profits. However, estimating the causal effect of these matches is difficult if the matching is not randomly assigned. We propose an experiment where matching is (partially) randomly assigned for a subset of loans on a microfinance website, allowing for a direct estimate of the effect of the match on loan fundraising velocity. Then, we propose using non-choice data to estimate the same effect. These estimates will be compared to the experimentally derived average causal effect."
