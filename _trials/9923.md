abstract: "The objective of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of nurturing care groups and nurturing care groups implemented in conjunction with maternal cash transfers in enhancing infant and young child feeding practices and nutritional outcomes in rural Ethiopia.  The sample is constituted by households who are Productive Safety Net Program beneficiaries, and thus presumptively among the poorest 10% of households; and all have a pregnant woman or an infant under nine months present in the household at baseline."
