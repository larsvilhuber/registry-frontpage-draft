abstract: "The potential of international migration to provide immediate and large income gains to migrant households have generated interest in programs that can enhance its development impacts. We compare the impact of financial education with that of access to financial services and products, and measure complementarities between the two programs. The study population comprises of households in Cabanatuan, Philippines with a family member abroad. To establish a causal effect, we use random assignment of households to financial education sessions or access to financial services or both. The outcomes of interest are variables related to long-term financial security of transnational households where the migrant workers are mostly female. These include formal saving, remittance expenditures, borrowings, wages and entrepreneurial activities."
