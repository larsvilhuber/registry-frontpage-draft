abstract: "With the suspension of childcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic, parents now more than ever play a very important role in accompanying the learning process at home. While high-income parents have the potential to make more productive investments, low-income parents may not only lack the resources, but also the knowledge on how to best support their children. Our study is an experimental evaluation of a text messaging intervention to improve parental engagement in educational activities that promote cognitive development in early childhood. In addition, we examine whether the timing of the messages has any differential impacts. "
