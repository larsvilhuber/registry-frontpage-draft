abstract: "We propose the evaluation of a new approach that is centered on improving the motivation of
public utility employees, by creating spaces for safe communication and collective introspection across and within the institutional hierarchy. This approach, titled Field-Level Leadership (FLL), constitutes a set of interventions aimed at identifying and supporting a cadre of motivated employees at all levels in the organisation. It allows self-identification of individual staff as change leaders, and emergence of internal constituencies of support for positive change.

The program implementation is planned to be progressive across the eight branches of the Addis Ababa Water and Sanitation authority. We propose an evaluation at three levels: (1) At the branch level (DiD) we track branch performance indicators; (2) At the employee level (DiD) we perform surveys to asses work motivations and the changes in employee's networks; and (3) At the consumer level (BDD) we evaluate consumers service perception.
