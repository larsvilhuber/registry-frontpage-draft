abstract: "Many rural poor in the developing world engage in agricultural work, either as cultivators or laborers. These individuals often face serious risks from weather fluctuations â€“ above all, erratic, excess or inadequate rainfall. Households attempt to informally insure themselves against these risks by diversifying the crops that they grow and by relying on friends and family in times of distress. However, informal mechanisms do not work as well when everybody in a given area is affected by the same adverse weather event. Historically, formal yield-based crop insurance has suffered from monitoring, selection, and incentive problems as well as high administrative costs.

Rainfall index insurance is a product that could help farmers hedge against agricultural losses due to excess or deficit rainfall, which is often cited as the largest risk to agricultural households. In a rainfall index product, policies pay out when rainfall exceeds or falls below pre-determined triggers based on historical rainfall data. Payouts are easy to calculate and index-based policies are simple to price since rainfall data are readily available. Another advantage of rainfall insurance is that the transaction costs can be low since insurance companies do not need to verify claims. Further, since farmers have no control over the level of rainfall, their choices to adopt the insurance or modify other behavior do not affect the sustainability of the insurance, in contrast to many yield-based crop insurance programs.

This randomized evaluation will help shed light on decision-making about weather risk and evaluate the potential of rainfall insurance to improve the livelihood and sustainability of rural poor households.
