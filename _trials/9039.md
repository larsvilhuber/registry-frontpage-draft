abstract: "This study examines the impacts of the Finnish hiring subsidy experiment. The experiment is a large-scale randomized controlled trial, the aim of which is to identify whether a hiring subsidy induces non-employer firms to hire a first employee. The experiment, which we implement with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment, offers non-employer firms a subsidy covering 50% of wage costs of new employees up to 10 000 euros. We randomly assign the population of non-employer firms to treatment and control groups and track short- and long-term outcomes in administrative tax registers and population panel datasets."
