abstract: "We will conduct a randomized controlled field experiment in the city of Esmeraldas, Ecuador, a province that shares a disproportionate burden of HIV/AIDS, to compare the effects of information, a behavioral nudge (“active choice”), and financial incentives in inducing individuals to get tested. The CDC and other health agencies recommend that all individuals should be routinely tested for HIV/AIDS. In our study, we will test these various strategies both on “at risk” individuals (men who have sex with men, and sex workers) and on a broader population."
