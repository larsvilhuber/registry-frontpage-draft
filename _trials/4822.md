abstract: "Traffic congestion is a serious global issue. A potential solution, which requires zero investment in infrastructure, is to convince solo car users to carpool. In this paper, we leverage the Waze Carpool service and run the largest ever digital field experiment to nudge commuters to carpool. We find a strong relationship between the affinity to carpool and the potential time saving through an high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane. Specifically, we estimate that mentioning the HOV lane increases the click-through rate and conversion rate by 133--185% and 64--141%, respectively relative to sending a generic message."
