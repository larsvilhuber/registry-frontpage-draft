abstract: "In an effort to attenuate the learning loss that likely occurs during summer vacation and to sustain the learning achievements of the most vulnerable students, summer learning programs aim to provide students with targeted learning support in-between two school years. Experimental evidence backing these programs mainly comes from studies conducted in the United States. Our study contributes to this literature by evaluating the 2022 edition of a summer learning program carried out in Italy. The program is called Arcipelago Educativo (trad. Educational Archipelago) and is run by Save the Children Italia with the support of Fondazione Agnelli. The program consists of two components â€“ educational labs (88 hours) and small-group tutoring (12 hours), which are delivered from the second half of June through the first week of September 2022 in 11 sites located in 10 Italian cities in the North (Milano, Torino, Marghera), Center (Aprilia, Ancona) and South (Bari, Rosarno, Napoli, Palermo). Between May and June 2022, 1,035 students (of which 423 primary and 612 secondary students) were signaled by their schools as in need of learning support and agreed to participate in the study. After filling out a baseline survey, the students were randomly assigned to either the treatment or the control group. While the treatment group hase received access to the above described summer learning program, control group students receive access to a learning support program offered in fall after the beginning of the school year 2022/2023. The trial evaluates the effects of the program on student achievement, as measured through four standardized tests on text comprehension, grammar, arithmetic and geometry. The study also investigates the effects of the program on secondary outcomes, such as non-cognitive dimensions related to learning. Outcome data are collected through surveys administered at baseline and at follow-up (beginning of September 2022) in controlled environments.
