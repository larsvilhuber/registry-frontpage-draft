abstract: "Antibiotics revolutionized medicine, but antimicrobial resistance (AMR) now poses a global threat to human health. Over-the-counter (OTC) sales of antibiotics contribute significantly to the proliferation of AMR, especially in developing countries. In this study, we conduct a randomized controlled trial in cooperation with the Addis Ababa Food, Medicine, and Healthcare Administration and Control Authority (AAFMHACA) with the aim of curtailing OTC antibiotic sales in Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia, where previous research has documented a high prevalence of OTC antibiotic dispensing. We randomly assign 831 community pharmacies and drugstores either to one of three experimental groups or to an untreated control group. Two interventions consist of informational letters targeted at pharmacists and the third intervention is an informational poster on display in the pharmacy premises. To evaluate the primary outcome (namely OTC antibiotic dispensing), we use Simulated Patients (SPs). The SP are blind to the interventions. They are trained to present symptoms of two prevalent health conditions to pharmacists and to ask for the appropriate medicine. The study relies on more than 2,000 unannounced SP's visits to pharmacies, distributed across three distinct waves. The first wave takes place before the interventions and gathers baseline data on the pharmacists' willingness to dispense OTC antibiotics. The second wave occurs three weeks after the delivery of the interventions, allowing us to evaluate their short-run effect. The third wave is conducted five months later, enabling the examination of the persistent effects of the interventions."
