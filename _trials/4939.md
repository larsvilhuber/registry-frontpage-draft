abstract: "The majority of the rural Indian population do not consume adequate amounts of fruit and vegetables, which is a key risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Food prices are a key barrier to healthy diets. The aim of this study is to implement and evaluate a sustainable financial incentive scheme to increase fruit and vegetables purchase in rural India. The study is nested within the Andhra Pradesh Children and Parents Study (APCAPS) in rural Telangana, India, and the intervention will be implemented in three randomly selected villages for three months, with another three villages as controls. We will use both quantitative and qualitative methods with community members (N=1,500 households), fruit and vegetable vendors, and local stakeholders (e.g. village leaders) to assess the short-term effect on fruit and vegetables purchasing, assess perceptions of the intervention and potential adverse effects, and establish the need for a full-scale trial which would evaluate the impact on clinical outcomes."
