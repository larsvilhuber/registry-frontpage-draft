abstract: "One of the most regular findings drawn from public opinion survey data is that women are less interested in politics than men are. Recent studies have started to challenge this common view, by showing that there are significant differences in the politicaltopics women and men are interested in. Allegedly, the classic indicator of political interest (‘In general, how interested are you in politics?’) does not capture equally well women and men’s political interests(Ferrín et al 2020; Ferrín & García-Albacete 2019). Consequently, part of the gender gap repeatedly identified over time and across countries might be –at least partially –an artifact of the measurement instruments used in surveys. Based on previous findings from cognitive interviews, in this study we conduct an experiment whereby we offer different sets of stimuli to the respondents that connect to different notions of the political. Specifically, we offer interviewees the possibility to first read a piece of political news of their choice. We compare treatment to control group within the same sex and between men and women. "
