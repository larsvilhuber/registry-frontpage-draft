abstract: "While the gig economy benefits workers with autonomy and flexibility, the lack of strong identities from work and bonds with colleagues can lead to low productivity and higher attrition compared to those working in traditional organizations. To address these problems, we conduct a randomized field experiment which uses recommender systems to build driver teams and introduce team contest in DiDi Chuxing, the largest ride sharing company in the world. Our goal is to evaluate the extent to which contest effect on productivity and driver retention can be maintained post contest, by using a team leaderboard. Our evaluation will be conducted using a three-phase randomized field experiment.
