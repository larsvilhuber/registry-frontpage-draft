abstract: "This study investigates how social image concerns affect womenâ€™s decisions to compete under two policy interventions (affirmative action and prosocial) and a baseline case of no intervention. We first construct a theoretical model to illustrate that women incur social image costs when participating in competition because this behavior is not aligned with traditional female gender norms, leading to a reluctance to participate in public competitions even under affirmative action policies favoring women. We hypothesize and theoretically demonstrate that introducing a prosocial option can encourage women to compete even when their decision is publicly observable. Second, we test our hypothesis by conducting a laboratory experiment that randomly manipulates the public observability of decisions under three interventions. "
