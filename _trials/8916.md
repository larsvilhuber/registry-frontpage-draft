abstract: "This project investigates how the adoption of a peer learning platform by teachers affects (i) the number and diversity of work-related interactions between students of a class, (ii) the density and diversity of students’ friendship networks, (iii) students’ cooperation with their peers and students’ prosocial behaviors, (iv) students’ well-being measured by their level of self-esteem, school satisfaction, frequency of positive and negative emotions, and prevalence of bullying. We estimate the effect of peer learning using a Randomized Control Trial. We randomly assign volunteer teachers at the school level to three treatment arms: (i) no access to the peer learning platform, (ii) access to the peer learning platform, (iii) access to the peer learning platform with information and encouragements to use peer learning outside of the platform and during daily lessons.
