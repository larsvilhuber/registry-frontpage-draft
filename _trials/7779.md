abstract: "The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the educational sector worldwide. One of the consequences is also psychological distress among teachers and students at the university levels of Bangladesh along with many other socio and economic impacts of the pandemic. In this regard, we plan to conduct a randomized tele-counseling intervention aimed to lower the mental health impact of COVID-19 on both teachers and students in Bangladesh. We expect to find that by providing  mental support to participating individuals will improve their mental health condition compared to the ones in the control group. We also hope to find affects on other secondary outcomes such as, their learning outcomes, well-being and productivity due to the tele-counselling intervention.
