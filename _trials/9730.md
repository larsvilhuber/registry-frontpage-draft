abstract: "Outstanding student debt has almost doubled in the past decade to over $1.7 trillion. Delayed graduation contributes to the student debt burden by increasing tuition payments without any additional wage premium. Behavioral theory suggests that young adults are prone to biases limiting their ability to connect short-run actions with long-run outcomes. We attempt to correct these biases using a low-touch financial literacy intervention within a randomized encouragement design at Pennsylvania State University, a large public university. We randomly invite and incentivize students to participate in an online tutorial connecting short-run academic success to long-run debt obligations and examine differences in academic outcomes. We will examine the effect on credit accumulation, retention, and GPAs.  We will also examine the effect for subgroups of interest including those more at risk of delayed graduation."
