abstract: "Job loss is one of the most costly economic risks workers are exposed to throughout their lifetimes, and firms vary widely in their separation rates. Workers' ability to perceive differences in employment risk across jobs affects sorting of workers to firms, compensating differentials for risk, and firm layoff decisions. Do workers accurately perceive the relative historical employment risk of different jobs? Does changing beliefs about historical firm risk affect beliefs about future personal risk and job search behavior? What are the implications of potential misperceptions for wages and separation rates? In this project, we survey jobseekers in Lower Austria to (1) compare beliefs about historical layoff rates to the true rates and (2) use an information provision experiment to study the effect of correcting misperceptions of historical employment risk on beliefs and job search behavior. Finally, we will use our estimates from the survey along with a model to quantify the effects of correcting misperceptions on wages, separation rates, and the allocation of workers to firms.
