abstract: "According to a 2022 report published by Giving USA, the total amount of charitable giving that U.S charities received in 2021 reached $484.85 billion, with nearly $330 billion of this amount given by individuals. This total accounts for approximately 2% of the 2021 U.S. GDP.  Understanding prosocial preferences and behaviors is of importance to policymakers and public economists who seek to maximize public welfare and most efficiently create public goods and to the directors of non-profit charitable organizations who seek to maximize giving. Previous research has identified pure altruism and warm glow as two important motivations for charitable giving. One of the contextual and environmental factors, the use of goal in fundraising campaigns, has been found to impact giving. The purpose of this research is to understand people's preferences and behaviors for charitable giving. We seek to understand how messaging of different motivation frames (pure altruism, warm glow) and distance to goal information (10%, 67%, 85% to goal) affect donation. The trial is conducted using a survey through an online research platform, Cloud Research. Participants will be asked to make a choice in a hypothetical charitable giving scenario and will be asked to answer a few questions about themselves in this 3-minute survey.
