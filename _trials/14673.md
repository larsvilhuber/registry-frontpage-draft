abstract: "This study explores how sustainability messaging affects young consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP), feelings of discomfort, and openness toward edible animal by-products. Using combinations of text and picture stimuli, the experiment aims to understand several key questions: how much young consumers are willing to pay for these by-products, how attitudes like food neophobia (fear of new foods) influence their WTP and levels of discomfort, and how visual cues impact their responses (willingness to pay as well as emotional and physiological responses). Additionally, the study investigates whether openness to new experiences influences the effectiveness of these stimuli on WTP. Findings from this research can provide insights into how sustainability-focused communication may shape consumer perceptions and acceptance of animal by-products, promoting more sustainable food choices among young consumers."
