abstract: "This project investigates potential sunk-cost effects on exercising behavior by providing a discount on membership fees to randomly selected individuals who recently signed a 12-month or 24-month contract at a fitness chain. Individuals in treatment Early Discount receive a 50% discount on their membership fee for two consecutive months at an early stage of their membership (the 2nd and 3rd, or 3rd and 4th, month of the current membership contract, respectively). To gain a deeper understanding of how individuals mentally account for sunk costs, individuals in treatment Late Discount receive the same 50% discount on their membership fee for two consecutive months, but at a later stage of their membership (in the 8th and 9th, or 9th and 10th, month of the current contract, respectively). At the beginning of the intervention, individuals in both treatment groups receive an email in which they are informed about their discounts. Individuals in the control group also receive an email to control for reminder effects."
