abstract: "We study the effect of different types of information treatments on: participation in training programs aimed at strengthening youth Mental Health; attitudes to mental health; policy-making preferences; and student outcomes.  

Intervention 1: We randomize ~1000 school administrators into three intervention groups, varying the nature of the information that they receive by email communication and the identity of the sender.  

Intervention 2: We randomize ~1100 public administrators into three intervention groups, varying the nature of the information that they receive in the survey and the identity of the sender. 

We use administrative data for analysis as well as data collected in the form of a baseline survey on ~240 randomly selected schools (~240 school principals and ~950 school staff) and ~1100 public administrators. The study will inform the extent to which information increases frontline participation in centrally provided programs and attitudes towards mental health, and whether the identity of the messenger matters for the efficacy of such information treatments; as well as the extent to which information shifts behavior and attitudes of public administrators.
