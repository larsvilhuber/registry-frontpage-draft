abstract: "During the last two decades, there has an extensive literature on group decision making. They compare the group decision with the individual decision. One takeaway from the literature is finding out which tasks/environment is suitable for individual or group decision-makers. 
However, most groups, especially in firms, are characterized by hierarchical organization structures. For instance, a family member may make decisions regarding savings and investments for his or her family; a manager may decide whether to invest in a new project for a company, or a president may decide whether to declare war on another country. While hierarchies are a common feature of organizations, surprisingly, little is known about their effect on outcomes in economic.
