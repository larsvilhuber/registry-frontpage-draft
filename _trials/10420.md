abstract: "This project seeks to understand whether and how firm formalization leads to sustainable development. A common trait of most developing economies is the vast presence of firms operating in the informal economy as unregistered enterprises. While many official development policies emphasize the sustainability potential of formalizing these enterprises, it is currently unclear whether and how firm formalization is associated with the adoption of sustainable, inclusive, and environmental business practices. Together with a collaborators from Makerere University Kampala and Uganda Small Scale Industry Association, this project will conduct a field experiment in Uganda consisting of randomized controlled trials to understand 1) why business owners choose to remain informal or decide to formalize, and 2) whether firm formalization leads to the adoption of sustainable business practices. This project can contribute with a more profound understanding of the decision-making underlying the transition to formality and its effect on sustainable development."
