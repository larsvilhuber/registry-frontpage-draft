abstract: "In this project, we investigate whether support for targeted transfers depends on people’s perception of regional circumstances. In particular, we study whether information on the rank of respondents’ county of residence in terms of educational outcomes (the share school-leavers without a degree) and economic outcomes (unemployment rate) changes their support for regionally targeted and non-targeted policies. We implement an online-survey experiment among a representative sample of adults aged 18 to 69 years in Germany. Respondents either complete the questions related to school-leavers without a degree or to unemployment. Within each group a randomly selected subgroup of respondents receives information on the current share of the respective measure in their county, as well as information on the number of counties in Germany with a higher share and information on the inequality in shares across Germany, visualized by a map of the country. Subsequently, we elicit respondents’ support for targeted and non-targeted public spending and their perception on the efficacy of such spending to examine how they vary with information on inequality between regions."
