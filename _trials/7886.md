abstract: "We conduct a randomized control trial experiment in Salima district, Malawi. This research project has four main objectives: i) to investigate how discounts affect take-up of different preventive health products, ii) to investigate how willingness to pay for different products varies with prior exposure to discount, iii) to investigate how price anchoring and learning influence future willingness to pay, and iv) to investigate how they might spillover to different types of goods.
