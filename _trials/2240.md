abstract: "In an experimental setting, we plan to test whether spectators have a willingness to pay to have an income distribution adhering to their fairness views implemented upon a pair of workers. Before spectators decide whether to implement their fairness views, we elicit participants' perceived prevalence of their own fairness views to see whether this is correlated with their willingness to implement. In one treatment, spectators are  informed about the empirical prevalence of their fairness views among the workers, before their willingness to pay is elicited. We argue that existence of a statistically significant treatment effect would be indicative of non-paternalistic motivation of implementing fairness views."
