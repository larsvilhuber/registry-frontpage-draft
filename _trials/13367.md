abstract: "I study the effect of how players in a board game generate their rolls on their beliefs of certain winning probabilities in the board game. In particular, it is varied whether players use a tablet computer vs. whether they use a physical die and a dice shuffler to generate their die rolls. The study is implemented as an RCT laboratory experiment."
