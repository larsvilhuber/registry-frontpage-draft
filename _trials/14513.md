abstract: "Entrepreneurs are often depicted as boundedly rational and myopic decision-makers who rely on local search and readily available data (Moore, Oesch, and Zietsma, 2007; Simon, 1957). When searching and attempting to define or assess market opportunities, entrepreneurs are guided by their pre-existing experiences. Their knowledge sets coming from individual experiences, backgrounds, values, and beliefs, or domains, define what is salient when framing strategic and entrepreneurial problems (Camuffo, Gambardella, and Pignataro, 2024).

While there is a growing body of literature arguing that theory framing is essential in strategic and entrepreneurial decision making (Felin and Zenger, 2017), little is known about the relationship between entrepreneurial domains, theory framing, and entrepreneurial idea (and solution) generation.

The goal of this project is to understand whether making entrepreneurs aware of the impact exerted by their domains on their entrepreneurial ideas triggers a change in experimentation and search, beyond initial domains. 

Since exploration beyond what is known can expand the opportunity set at the expense of increased uncertainty and monetary and non-monetary (i.e., time, effort) costs, it is unclear whether exploration beyond initial domains can be beneficial or not. Given this trade-off, we argue that entrepreneurs who engage in “scientific entrepreneurship” (Zellweger and Zenger, 2023), adopting a theory-based experimentation approach, explore in a more structured way and are able to reduce the burden of expanded search (Camuffo, Cordova, Gambardella, and Spina, 2020).

To this aim, we investigate the impact that domain awareness (which shall trigger increased exploration) has in addition to scientific or theory-based experimentation (which shall reduce the cost of exploration). A companion study finds that domain awareness and theory-based experimentation have a complementary effect on the number of high-value strategic alternatives generated by entrepreneurs (Frosi, Chondrakis, Gagliardi, and Mariani, 2024), but it remains agnostic as to what mechanism underlies this increase in idea generation. This study adopts a similar design, and administers a similar manipulation, but aims to uncover the mechanisms through which the domains intervention, conditional on the scientific intervention, impacts exploration, theory framing, and decision-making. In particular, the project designs and implements a laboratory experiment following up on a field experiment with early-stage entrepreneurs carried out at ESADE University in Spain (previously pre-registered on AEA under the code AEARCTR-0009325) and a laboratory experiment with entrepreneurship graduate students carried out at Bocconi University in Italy (AEARCTR-0013189).
