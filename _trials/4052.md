abstract: "Girls in developing countries face lack of information, stigma and fear surrounding a natural part of a womanâ€™s life: menstruation. We explore how stigmas can be sustained, when plausibly universal. We test this in a field experiment with secondary school girls in Tanzania, using revealed preference and information treatment. In addition, we survey boys to understand information constraints and peer pressure. "
