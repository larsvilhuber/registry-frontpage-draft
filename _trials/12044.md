abstract: "In many parts of the world, children with disabilities are excluded from education. The disability gap in education is notably larger in low-income settings, such as in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa. We conduct a field experiment to investigate the effect of an education technology (edtech) intervention on the learning outcomes, social inclusion, and mental well-being of children with special needs in low-income settings. The study is implemented in western Kenya, where disability prevalence is one of the highest. Children with special needs of primary school-going age are recruited through a government assessment and screening program within sampled schools. After randomization at the school level, we administer a baseline survey to positively screened children and their caregivers after which we offer participants in the intervention group a low-cost mobile device equipped with offline-enabled numeracy and literacy learning software. Their math, literacy, social inclusion, and mental well-being outcomes will be compared to a control group that does not receive this intervention after one year."
