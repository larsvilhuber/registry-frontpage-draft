abstract: "Modern communication technologies enable efficient exchange of information, but often sacrifice
direct human interaction inherent in more traditional forms of communication. This raises the
question of whether the lack of personal interaction induces individuals to exploit informational
asymmetries. We conducted two experiments with 866 subjects to examine how human versus
machine interaction influences cheating for financial gain. We find that individuals cheat about
three times more when they interact with a machine rather than a person, regardless of whether
the machine is equipped with human features. When interacting with a human, individuals are
particularly reluctant to report unlikely favorable outcomes, which is consistent with social image
concerns. The second experiment shows that dishonest individuals prefer to interact with a machine
when facing an opportunity to cheat. Our results suggest that human interaction is key to mitigating
dishonest behavior and that self-selection into communication channels can be used to screen for
dishonest people."
