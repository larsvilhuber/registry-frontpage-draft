abstract: "This study will evaluate whether framed, unconditional cash transfers (UCT) to pregnant women and lactating mothers are effective in improving the health of their children, as measured by incidence of stunting and wasting. This will be the first randomized evaluation in India of unconditional cash transfers for maternal and child health, and will be implemented by the Government of Jharkhand (GoJH) in eight districts. We will study the impact of a 24-month long UCT to pregnant and lactating mothers, testing how variation in the timing of transfers affects child health."
