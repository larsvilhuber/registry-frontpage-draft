abstract: "We examine how professional financial traders behave in two classic laboratory market environments. First, traders trade an asset with a declining fundamental value (Smith, Suchanek, & Williams, 1988) while receiving private information about the asset's value. Second, traders make choices in a ``guessing game'' with peers (Nagel, 1995) as well as within our novel ``individual guessing game'' framework. We also collect data on cognitive factors (IQ and CRT), behavioral factors (risk, confidence, and digit-ratio), and personality traits (e.g. Big 5). This is compared against data from undergraduate students. In accordance with previous studies, undergraduates overprice the asset (a ``bubble'') and, in the guessing game, make choices consistent with different levels of strategic reasoning. In contrast, traders trade at prices that closely reflect the asset's declining fundamental value and make choices that suggest higher levels of strategic reasoning than the levels of the students. Professional traders are also better than undergraduates in aggregating private information through trading activity. In addition, choices from our individual guessing game can decompose a subject's own level of strategic reasoning from their belief about the population's level of reasoning. Our data show that traders anticipate that their opponents will have higher levels of strategic reasoning than do that of students. "
