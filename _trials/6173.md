abstract: "Young people use technology to communicate, test out and develop their identities, create and join spaces to reflect their interests and passions, and feel a sense of community with others. Despite these many great possibilities, there is a need for young people to be better equipped to navigate their connected, constantly changing, digital world. 
Several programs have been developed and implemented in schools to address this need. The concern with these programs, however, is that many are not evidence-based, nor has their impact been robustly evaluated. Digital Compass is an 8-week evidence-based program designed to support the ethical development of teenagers in a world of technological change. The program has been developed by The Behavioural Insights Team in collaboration with the Vincent Fairfax Family Foundation and The Alannah and Madeline Foundation. 
The aim of the current project is to understand whether the Digital Compass program can help to support the ethical development of teenagers, particularly in the online environment. To do so, we have designed a study to evaluate the effectiveness of Digital Compass on teenagersâ€™ self-reported online ethical behaviour. Our primary outcome variables are self-reported prosocial behaviour online, antisocial behaviour online, and attainment of goals related to ethical development identified during the program."
