abstract: "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are characterized by relatively lower retention and pass rates than equivalent in-person courses. One type of dropouts (Type 1) is made up of enrollees for whom the course may not be appropriate. For these students, the optimal set-up might be one that allows students to “shop”—enroll in a course, discover whether the content or level is appropriate, and then drop out if need be after feeling sufficiently informed, but before too much time has been invested in making the choice. Another type of dropouts (Type 2) may be made up of enrollees for whom the course is appropriate, and who intend to complete it, but face small barriers that inhibit them from doing so. Discouragement could be one of those barriers. If learning objectives are imprecise, students may underestimate the relevance of the course, or focus on the wrong teaching points. This could lead to poor performance, which in turn feeds discouragement and ultimately fuels drop out. Therefore a model that makes learning objectives clear upfront could lead to reduced attrition over time. 

Our research proposes to identify a simple intervention that allows potential dropouts (type 1 and type 2) to self-select into either type as soon as possible. In addition, it would seek to help students who self-select into the second type (i.e. those who want to complete the course ex-ante) by reducing some of the barriers that they may face, ultimately leading to higher course completion rates. The intervention we propose includes giving students a Baseline Diagnostic Test at the start of the course. This diagnostic may help type 1 students understand exactly what the course covers, and what measurable outcomes they are expected to learn, and whether or not the content is right for them. It may also help spark early engagement with type 2 students, giving them a preview of the concepts covered in the course, allowing them to focus on the right teaching points, and motivating them to complete the course. Using our online course JPAL101x: Evaluating Social Programs, we aim to run a randomized evaluation of this intervention."
