abstract: "Employer preferences over worker characteristics are key determinants of employment outcomes. In this project, we will estimate employer preferences in high-skilled labor markets in India. We partner with a large job matching platform that helps women in India find jobs after career breaks. We will use Incentivized Resume Rating (IRR) to elicit the preferences of recruiters who use the platform to find workers. We will estimate preferences over a range of candidate characteristics - including gender, caste, educational qualifications and skills, work experience, and career breaks - and in several different sectors."
