abstract: "Competitive environments are known to drive more efficient outputs, and organizations frequently use contests to boost effort and performance levels. However, it remains unclear how increasing competitive pressure impacts individuals' self-assessment of their abilities and their use of resources. This raises the question of whether individuals and organizations might resort to unethical behavior to gain a competitive advantage. In this project, we will conduct an online experiment where participants will compete against peers in various competitive settings to explore this issue."
