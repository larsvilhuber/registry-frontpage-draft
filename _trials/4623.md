abstract: "W conduct an online survey experiment evaluating the effectiveness of civil society campaigns in shaping the attitudes and behavior of voters in the context of right-wing populism. This online experiment complements a field experiment conducted in the context of three state elections in Germany in the autumn of 2019. This online experiment has the following main goals: first, we aim to replicate our field experiment’s investigation of whether civil society campaigns against right-wing populism can influence attitudes and (vot- ing) behavior at the individual level. Second, we wish to utilize the individual-level data to study potential mechanisms and heterogeneities of how civil society campaigns might influence (voting) behavior. Third, we attempt to measure a ‘first stage’ of our field experiment: are survey respondents from the treated regions of our field experiment more aware of the civil society campaigns that we study in the field experiment? Finally, the main goal of this online experiment is to shed light on the role of a perceived alignment of identity traits between senders and receivers of political communication for the effectiveness of the communication. We do so by varying information about the (regional) identity of the campaign sender (the civil society organization)."
