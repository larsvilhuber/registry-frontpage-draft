abstract: "In this project, we will implement an experiment on a sample of around 3000 middle school students (11 to 14 years old) enrolled across 14 schools in 7 Italian cities. The experiment is designed to evaluate the cost of gender stereotypes, including self-stereotypes of students, stereotypes induced by peers' and parents' pressure. Students will perform two tasks: the first task involves math multiple-choice questions and the second task literature multiple-choice questions. For each correct question they will get one point and the student with the highest score in the class will get a 10 euro gift card. Before performing the two tasks, each student can choose one task to get double points and therefore increase their likelihood of winning. We will randomly assign the type of information given to students when making this choice to evaluate if students are more likely to choose the gender conforming field under different circumstances. The information shared is designed to create variation in students' beliefs on who will have knowledge of their decisions and on parents' recommendations/ beliefs. The final goal is to evaluate whether there are significant gender differences on the efficiency of this decision making process and how these differences vary considering different information frameworks.
