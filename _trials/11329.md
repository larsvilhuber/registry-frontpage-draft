abstract: "Many Filipina domestic workers finance their investments through loans from Hong Kong moneylenders, taking on the responsibility of expensive repayment installments and the risk of severe penalties in case of default. 

This study tries to uncover the factors that drive this behaviours, focusing on migrants' lack of control over expenses. In particular it examines the role of family relationships and the financial discipline that loans provide. 

We will use experimental methods with Filipina domestic workers in Hong Kong to generate data that will allow us to examine the mechanisms underlying their financial choices. "
