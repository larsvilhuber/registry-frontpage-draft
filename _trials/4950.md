abstract: "The existence of the gender gap in employment – especially during parenthood - is well established in the economic literature. But why do women work less than men? 
In the first part of our experiment, we surveyed a representative sample of adolescents’ in Germany and found that adolescents reduce their planned labor market supply during parenthood and fertility expectations when being confronted with the social norm that parents of young children should reduce their labor market participation. In this project, we build on the findings of the first project and investigate remaining open questions related to the impact of social-norms information on labor supply expectations, educational, occupational, mating and fertility decisions among adolescents in Germany. For that purpose, we implement two survey experiments among an additional sample of adolescents aged between 14 and 17 years. The information treatment group in the first (second) experiment is provided with factual information about existing social norms regarding paternal/maternal labor supply (within-household division of labor). By comparing responses between the uninformed control groups and the treatment groups, we evaluate (i) whether information about social norms affects our outcome variables of interest (e.g., expected labor supply) and (ii) whether this information also affects the gender gap in these outcomes.
