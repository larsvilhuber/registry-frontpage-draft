abstract: "This study investigates effective strategies to enhance student academic performance and reduce achievement gaps among diverse student populations (i.e., first-generation, underrepresented minorities, and gender groups). Our approach involves collecting data on students' current study habits/methods and providing personalized feedback on efficient study techniques/habits described in the literature. Prior research indicates that targeted guidance on effective study habits can significantly improve academic outcomes, especially for students who may lack access to this information. By disseminating tailored study strategies, we aim to equip all students with the tools necessary for academic success. "
