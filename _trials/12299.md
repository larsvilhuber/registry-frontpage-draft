abstract: "We describe the analysis plan for an online intervention designed to learn the historical views among different demographic groups in the US and to determine whether enquiring about these views has an effect on political attitudes and polarization. The study is a follow-up that builds on a previous round of data collection (AEARCTR-0009108, AEARCTR-0011305), implementing the same methodology and asking similar questions from a different set of participants. We will include new questions to elicit motivated reasoning and aim to recontact participants to examine the degree to which the baseline patterns persist weeks after the intervention."
