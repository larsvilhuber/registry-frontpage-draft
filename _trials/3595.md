abstract: "Using an online experiment with crowdworkers, we investigate the workers’ willingness to pay to avoid monitoring. In the experiment, workers face the choice between a default version of a task and an alternative. Workers are informed that both versions require identical effort. Workers state their willingness to pay for switching from the default to the alternative version of the task, and then perform the task. In the control group, the instructions do not touch the issue of monitoring. In contrast, workers in the treatment group are informed that the default option is a version including monitoring. We test if the treatment shifts workers’ willingness to pay to switch to the alternative version of the task."
