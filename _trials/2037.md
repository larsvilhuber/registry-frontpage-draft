abstract: "In this field experiment, we study competition among traders who purchase cocoa from farmers in Sierra Leone and sell it to wholesalers, We provide a random group of traders a bonus per pound of cocoa. We study the effect of the intervention on the prices traders pay and the credit they provide to farmers and on the quantity they purchase from farmers. We interpret treatment-control differences in prices and quantities purchased from farmers through a standard model of Cournot competition to derive estimates of trader differentiation, which is found to be low. Combining this result with quasi-experimental variation in world prices we can also estimate that the number of traders effectively competing is 50% higher than the number operating in a village, highlighting the challenge of defining market boundaries. In turn, own-price and cross-price supply elasticities are high. These estimates suggest farmers face a competitive market in the first stage of the value chain.  "
