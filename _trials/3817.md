abstract: "Community colleges offer great promise to help students build human capital. Yet 60 percent of current students report being ill informed about career opportunities, 33 percent want more academic advising, and fewer than half of community college students complete their associates or certificate program.   This study will implement and evaluate an intervention aimed at increasing persistence and graduation at community colleges.  The research uses a randomized controlled trial (RCT) research design at several community college campuses within the Community College System of New Hampshire (CCSNH). This project helps distinguish among several distinct hypotheses as to why college coaching/ counseling can be effective for students.  The three treatment arms include 1) business as usual, 2) major, career and course planning coupled with auto generated reminders, and 3) the same planning sessions coupled with intensive bi-weekly counseling from a professional based at the college.  Survey and in process data will be combined with results across treatment arms to identify the barriers to college completion and which elements of these interventions are the most effective. "
