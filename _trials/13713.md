abstract: "The long-running debate about affirmative action in college admissions intensified in 2023 after the Supreme Court ruled that race should not affect admissions decisions. We examine the extent and mechanisms by which race affects the admissions process after the 2023 ruling. We explore evidence from a field experiment where fictitious applicants request application fee waivers from nearly all admissions counselors at US universities. We find that Black and Asian applicants are much more likely to have their requests rejected than White applicants.
Asian applicants are also 30% less likely to receive a waiver than a white applicant. We find that the a majority of the discrimination comes from very selective universities."
