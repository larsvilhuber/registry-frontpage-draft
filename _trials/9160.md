abstract: "Human history is marred by countless instances of systematic oppression (economic and otherwise) even though oppression is objectively detrimental. Despite our extensive knowledge of the moral, social, and monetary costs of oppression, we know much less about its behavioral determinants, how it sustains, or its second-order effects. This is likely due to the inherent ethical and moral considerations imposed by attempting to create oppression in a controlled setting. To this end, we introduce a novel experimental framework that mimics the behavioral underpinnings of oppression in an ethical, replicable way. We use this new framework to study the relationship between social status, monetary incentives, and the willingness to oppress others. Further, we investigate how the experience of an oppressive regime impacts the trust exhibited by both its perpetrators and victims. "
