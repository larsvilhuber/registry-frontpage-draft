abstract: "Refugee women with short formal education face a higher risk of long term unemployment and social exclusion than other immigrant groups. They typically only have access to language training, as most labor market integration programs demand a high level of language proficiency. Developing early integration programs for this group is crucial for both refugees and host countries.

In this project we will evaluate a new and unique integration program that was developed and put into effect in Sweden. The aim with the program, run in cooperation by the City of Gothenburg and the Public Employment Office (PES) in Gothenburg, was to get newly arrived refugee women with short education better integrated (in terms of, e.g., labor market outcomes).

The evaluation will be based on a randomized experiment, in which potential participants in the program were randomly assigned into treatment and control groups.
