abstract: "The aeioTU Longitudinal Study is a randomized trial longitudinal study which inquires into the immediate and short-term cognitive, linguistic, nutritional and social effects of a comprehensive educational and nutritional 0-5 intervention in Colombia, in the form of aeioTU centers. The research is headed by Milagros Nores from the National Institute of Early Education Research (NIEER) in collaboration with Raquel Bernal from Universidad de los Andes in Colombia. The study is an independent evaluation that follows 1,218 childrenâ€™s developmental trajectory between 2010 and 2015.  This randomized longitudinal study of high-quality early education in the Colombian context is the first of its kind, by including all cohorts of children before school age and focusing on high-quality center-based education in two disadvantaged neighborhoods in the northern coastal region of Colombia.  Households and children were randomly assigned from a waiting list to aeioTu or the control group. Children who won the lottery were enrolled in the two AeioTu centers in the study through lottery supervised by NIEER.  The lottery was based on an oversubscription model, as the centers were built from scratch and opened to the community in 2010 and early 2011, each center only had spaces for about 300 children. "
