abstract: "Individual decision making is shaped by a combination of internal and external constraints.  While a lot of research has focused on external constraints (such as institutions and social norms) on an individualâ€™s behavior, there has been relatively little focus on the importance of internal constraints. Such internal constraints may be ideas of morality, self-image and guilt that reflect some combination of internalized institutional and social norms as well as moral concerns. In this research paper, we examine the relationship between internal constraints and external constraints, in order to shed light on some of the behavioral roots of corruptibility."
