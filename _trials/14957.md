abstract: "We seek to study the impact of large language models (LLMs) and LLMs with additional domain-specific scaffolding on legal work. While pre-trained LLMs have been shown to increase worker productivity across a number of tasks, there is limited empirical research on how domain-specific software integrations and post-training model enhancements could drive additional impacts on worker productivity and quality. In real-world work applications, LLMs are often enhanced with “scaffolding” that includes tool-use capabilities, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), access to specialized datasets, backend prompt optimization, and user interfaces tailored for specific use cases. Recent research suggests that such scaffolding can significantly enhance the capabilities of pre-trained models, but there is a lack of empirical studies quantifying the effect this has on different kinds of work. As AI progress continues, understanding the marginal impact of scaffolding built around LLMs will be essential to gauging AI’s impact on the future of work. This study aims to generate new evidence on this question, using legal work as an experimental setting. To do so, we propose a RCT to evaluate the impact of LLM-powered legal assistant software on legal labor. We will randomly assign second- and third-year law students into a no-AI control group and two treatment groups: one with access to OpenAI’s o1 model and the other with access to VLex’s Vincent AI, a legal assistant software built on GPT-4o with additional features specific to legal work. We will then measure productivity and work quality differences on a set of 6 legal work tasks that participants complete, and estimate the causal impact of using LLMs and LLM-powered tools to assist with these tasks.
