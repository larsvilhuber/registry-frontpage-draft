abstract: "This study explores user preferences between AI-generated explanations and those curated by popular platforms like Quora. We identify popular questions in five scientific fields and use responses from platforms and AI. Through a field experiment, participants were presented with texts from both sources and asked to indicate their preferred explanation. The findings have the potential to reveal trends in user bias. Our analysis provides insights into the evolving role of AI in content generation and its comparison with traditional human-curated knowledge platforms. "
