abstract: "Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, this study investigates how motivational messages impact students’ framing and decision-making a¬round college and career pathways. Here, we implemented the intervention at the end of the orientation courses funded by the PNRR, consisting of two different textual prompts: the first message concerns with the extrinsic motivations: reaching higher education is a pathway to reach (and deserves to be taken, e.g., pay raise job security in a market, etc.). The second message corresponds to intrinsic motivations: it highlights that education is a journey of personal development and a way to open oneself to the world.
The RCT explores how these contrasting messages influence students' choices, aspirations, and reflections on their educational trajectories. Through the integration of questions about their socio-demographic background, previous educational experiences, and perceptions of university education, the study seeks to understand the factors shaping students’ educational and career intentions. This design allows for a robust analysis of the role of motivational framing in shaping future-oriented behaviors. Overall, the results of this research will serve not only to bring more evidence-based recommendations for improvement to orientation programs, but also to contribute to a wider movement towards equity in education and aid the creation of educational programs that not only prevent them from falling behind, but rather that graduate informed consumers to help fight inequalities.
