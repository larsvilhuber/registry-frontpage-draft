abstract: "Low SES-children achieve significantly lower scores in both literacy and math compared to their peers. In Denmark, this difference already exists when the children take the first national test at second grade. In literacy, the difference between low-SES children and their peers remain approximately constant during the schoolyears, while the gap in math increases. 

This randomized controlled trial evaluates the effects of two interventions aimed at improving low-SES childrenâ€™s scores in literacy and math. Both interventions take place during the school day over the course of 13 weeks. In the first treatment, small groups of students will receive supplementary training in math, while in the other treatment group children will be matched in pairs and read with older schoolchildren.
