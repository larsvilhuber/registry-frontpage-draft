abstract: "Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is cause by raised serum total bilirubin levels usually manifests as jaundice and is commonly an indirect type.
There is a dearth of available in literature that illuminate the beneficial role of probiotics in
significantly reducing the total serum bilirubin. If the use of probiotics remarkably reduces the
serum bilirubin levels in neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, it would routinely be advised in the
future for newborns with neonatal jaundice. It would help reduce the side effects of
phototherapy, hospital admission, maternal-infant separation, and prolonged hospital
stays.Â Ultimately reducing the overall morbidity associated with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.
The objective of the study is to compare the mean reduction in bilirubin and mean duration of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia
with probiotic and phototherapy in comparison with phototherapy alone."
