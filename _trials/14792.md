abstract: "In large elections where there is correlated information and the possibility, however small, of misinformation (i.e. that information is non-informative), information aggregation fails if voters have a non-zero, potentially negligible, idiosyncratic bias towards either party. The mechanism in play is that if a voter is pivotal, then the posterior on information is that the most likely event is that information is non-informative, regardless of how its prior probability might have been. Thus, a voter is better of voting following the bias even if it is arbitrarily small. Our experiments are designed to understand the empirical relevance of this phenomenon and the underlying mechanism."
