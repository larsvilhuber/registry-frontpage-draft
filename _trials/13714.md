abstract: "This trial assesses the impact of remote work with monthly office visits on productivity and job satisfaction among call center agents in Sanliurfa, Turkey. In the partner institution, agents typically work fully remotely. As part of the trial, some randomly selected employees will visit the office once a month. The study aims to evaluate productivity, job satisfaction, and retention over nine months. Follow-up surveys will be conducted several months after the intervention to measure long-term effects."
