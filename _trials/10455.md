abstract: "There is a persistent enrollment gap in early child care by migration background in Germany. This raises the question why policy interventions to mitigate this gap are not implemented. By means of a representative Germany-wide survey and randomized survey experiments, we investigate the causal effect of information about the early child care system on participants’ support for various policies that aim at closing the enrollment gap between migrants and natives."
