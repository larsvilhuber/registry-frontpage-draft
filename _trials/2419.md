abstract: "Recent studies have demonstrated substantial effects of consultancy on learning and productivity (Allen et al., 2011; Bloom et al., 2013; Hanna et al., 2014). However, the channels through which the effect of consultancy materializes and the relative strength of the different channels remain to be clarified. In order to study this question, we implement a randomized controlled trial investigating the impact of consultancy in the form of a one-year coaching program aiming to improve teacher skills through peer coaching. It will allow us to measure the relative strength of various channels through which the effects of consulting can materialize."
