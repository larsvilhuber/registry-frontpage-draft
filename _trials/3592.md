abstract: "In the Netherlands dissatisfaction with the current scheme of social welfare has led various Dutch cities to run field experiments to test out new ways of delivering income support to its citizens. Among them is the City of Utrecht, where the study goes by the name ‘Weten wat werkt’ (English: What works) and includes more than 700 current recipients of public income support (also social assistance or minimum income guarantee). For the duration of the trial job search requirements and welfare sanctions tied to income support will be eliminated to make room for more autonomy (treatment 1). Other aspects include a more tailor-made approach in supporting welfare recipients (treatment 2) and increasing financial incentives to take up paid work (treatment 3). The study is set up as a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with interventions running from June 2018 to September 2019. Outcomes of interest are labour market outcomes, job search behaviour, societal participation and social activation, participants’ health and well-being, participants’ satisfaction with the new scheme, as well as their financial situation."
