abstract: "For over 30 years, Wallin Education Partners has operated the Wallin Scholars Program, a program that provides financial aid, advising, and career supports to Minnesota high school seniors from low-income backgrounds as they transition to attending 4-year and 2-year colleges. The study will use a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design to estimate the causal effect of the opportunity to participate in the Wallin Scholars program. The program contains three main components: one-on-one advising support; financial aid for college and college-related expenses; and access to career supports such as internships and networking opportunities. Access to the program is contingent on being an actively enrolled student at an eligible college and remaining engaged with Wallin program staff and advising.   

The study plans to enroll approximately 1,600 students into two randomly assigned experimental arms, a program group and a control group, across two cohorts, fall 2025 and fall 2026. To answer whether the Wallin Scholars Program improves academic and career outcomes, the team will estimate the average (across individuals) intent-to-treat (ITT) effect of the program on retention in college and degree attainment through five years after random assignment. The program will also follow outcomes related to employment and earnings through administrative data sources and student surveys.   "
