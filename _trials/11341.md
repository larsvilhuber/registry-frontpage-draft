abstract: "Preparing job applications is time consuming. Applicants expect their application files to be reviewed carefully and fairly for the effort they put in. A fast rejection soon after submitting the application understandably generates frustration and leads to the perception of being unfairly treated, negative reciprocity follows. After making the determination that a certain candidate is unsuitable, the timing as to when the rejection letter should be sent is then of importance for a good company image, positive candidate experience and job-seekers' morale."
