abstract: "We investigate the perception of fairness in a conflicting claim problem, i.e  n a distribution problem in which the available amount of resource
to be shared (water) is insufficient to cover all agentsâ€™ rights or needs. We use distributive justice criteria to characterize different ways of distributing water among competitive users.  We then analyse whether the perception of fairness associated to the proposed water sharing rules is conditioned by specific features of the decision context (in particular water scarcity).
