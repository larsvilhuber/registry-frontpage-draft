abstract: "Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits are critical in helping workers smooth consumption when they lose a job through no fault of their own. However, only about half of eligible unemployed workers in the United States claim UI benefits. The online survey recruits a sample of unemployed workers who are likely eligible for UI but are not claiming benefits and assesses those workersâ€™ knowledge of and beliefs about UI. The information provision experiment of the survey investigates two key mechanisms underlying incomplete UI take-up: stigmatized attitudes towards unemployment benefits and overconfidence in job finding probability."
