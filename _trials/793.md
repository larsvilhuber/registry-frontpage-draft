abstract: "The study tested whether an organizational level, occupational health intervention can lower the sickness absence levels and improve wellbeing for the personnel in the participating pre-schools (0-6 years). The intervention focused on improving the working environment capabilities of the safety group in each unit (local manager and employee representatives) and on implementing initiatives that improve the working environment by improving the work practices."
