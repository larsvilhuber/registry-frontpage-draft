abstract: "We investigate whether regular email reminders can stimulate gym attendance. We will send out weekly emails to a random sample of gym members of a large gym facility (with multiple locations) during a period of 3 months. In addition we collect a measure of interest in email reminders prior to the intervention. We investigate the effect separately for those that do and those that do not indicate interest in reminders.  We will collect detailed attendance data during the intervention period, as well as during three subsequent months to investigate long run effects (habit formation)."
