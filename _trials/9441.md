abstract: "Across the globe, people tend to misperceive their true position in the income distribution. Theory predicts that a correction of this misperception leads to an increase in the demand for redistribution among the richer half of the population if people are averse to inequality. We test whether correcting perceived relative income has a significant and positive effect on the demand for environmental public goods, such as clean air. We test this hypothesis empirically with an online survey experiment with 2,500 Indian respondents recruited by Dynata."
