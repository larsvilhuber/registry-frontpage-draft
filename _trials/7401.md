abstract: "The study is motivated by the policy challenge of re-integrating recent graduates from a large scale training program in India (DDU-GKY) back into the labour market following the massive job losses caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The DDU-GKY programme targets rural poor youth, and provides short-term training with guaranteed job placement. This study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of an app-based job platform that matches job seekers with employers, using an encouragement design. The Jharkhand State Livelihood Promotion Society (JSLPS) has called 1,122 rural youth, randomly selected from 2,260 former DDU-GKY trainees from Bihar and Jharkhand, to inform them about the government-supported app Yuva Sampark and help them register. The main outcomes of this study are job search activities and employment rates in the sample. "
