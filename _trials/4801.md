abstract: "Stock market investing seems not to be an attractive  choice for many people,. Many financial markets remain underdeveloped, including those in Mexico. This project examines a lack of demand for risky financial assets on the part of Mexican savers, in order to better understand the obstacles that prevent them from investing through their own securities markets.

The project administers a survey and vignettes to 1,000 qualified individuals in the Mexico City area. The survey will consist of Likert scale questions that examine the importance that people place upon various factors in making their decision to invest. These questions then lead to the core of the project - a series of vignettes (short fact patterns presented in a few sentences) which vary key features that might be found in a typical investment account. The vignettes isolate the effects of those features ("factors") to estimate whether changing the nature of that factor is correlated with a change in the probability of investing. 


This project contemplates a randomized trial. We establish as a control an account which contains four factors that be viewed as "restrictive" and then vary these factors with less restrictive outcomes. Thus, we have four factors with two outcomes each, for a total of 16 vignettes. The restrictive account will be our control, and the remaining 15 variations will be treatments.  In each, respondents will be asked whether the features described in their vignette makes them more or less likely to establish a similar account. 

Survey participants will be randomly assigned to one of these 16 vignettes [each vignette will have a sample size of about 65 respondents], and the mean responses as to the likelihood of investing will be compared to the alternatives. In this way, we hope to directly identify those features that potential investors find important and offer guidance to policymakers and others as to how to tailor their products to overcome those obstacles to investing and meet this demand.
