abstract: "The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Program, provides cash payments to the families of 1.3 million low-income children with disabilities. SSI children with mental and behavioral conditions such as ADHD and speech delay have high high school dropout rates and low employment rates in adulthood (Hemmeter et al. 2009; Davies et al. 2009). Available evidence indicates that SSI families are unaware of the high likelihood of removal from SSI at age 18 and may underinvest in the human capital of their children (Johnson et al, 2007). Using data from the Social Security Administration (SSA), which implements SSI, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial to estimate the effects of informing the families of SSI children about the likelihood of removal from SSI at age 18. We will inform randomly-selected households of their childâ€™s likelihood of removal at 18, as well as provide opportunities to invest in their child at no charge to them. We will measure the effect of the intervention on short-run investments in human capital investments and plan to gather data on longer-run outcomes (e.g., educational outcomes, earnings) as well. The RCT will provide evidence on how expectations about the availability of government benefits affect human capital investment decisions. "
