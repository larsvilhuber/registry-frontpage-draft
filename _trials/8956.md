abstract: "This experiment aims to cleanly distinguish conformity to in-group norms, differentiation from out-group norms and social learning under different settings, and to use that distinction to clarify how norms change. To this end, British participants whose stated nationality is either English or Scottish, will be recruited from a large Internet panel. Participants will be asked to privately make a series of binary choices, and in particular to state their opinions on a variety of policy suggestions, and to perform incentivized assessment tasks. Tasks will be of two types: (1) tasks where both nationalities are likely to be perceived as equally capable of task performance; (2) tasks where one nationality is likely to be perceived as having more task-related knowledge, and therefore as more capable of task performance. To allow social learning, choice items will ideally involve uncertainty about their intrinsic value. Items will be selected based on a preliminary survey, and will ideally reduce preexisting group dispositions, and beliefs about group norms. 

Survey participants will be randomly assigned to receive or not receive information about the choices of other participants. Those who receive social information will be matched with a random sample of each nationality group participating in the preliminary survey. Before making each choice, they will be informed of the descriptive norms prevailing in the samples of nationality groups assigned to them. Comparing the choices of survey participants observing different (or no) combinations of in-group and out-group norms, will allow us to disentangle the three channels of social influence. 

We may also run another survey where British participants will be asked to rate the extent to which each policy proposal pertains to each nationality group; and the level of knowledge or capabilities of each group in each task."
