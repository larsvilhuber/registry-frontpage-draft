abstract: "We study the role of social identity and "groupiness'' in the processing of and demand for information using an online experiment with a representative sample of the US population, deployed the week before the upcoming 2020 US presidential election on November 3.  Specifically, we ask whether (i) people update their beliefs in reaction to consuming news in a biased way, (ii) whether this bias increases if news source labels are observable, (iii) whether groupiness as measured by the other-other allocation game moderates both these effects, and (iv) whether exposure to news articles from a neutral source or the other side increases prediction accuracies. In our online experiment, approximately 1,000 participants have to predict both the outcome of the 2020 presidential election and policy-sensitive statistics a year after the election conditional on its outcome. To update their initial predictions, individuals receive or can select articles on the respective topics from different news sources.  Our key experimental variation is whether the articles come with a label of the news sources or not, where news sources differ in their political leaning."
