abstract: "Background and Purpose: Millions of people around the world experience abdominal surgery every year. Despite of subsequent advances in anesthesia and surgical care, postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) still are a significant problem in modern practice. 
This study was done to investigate the effect of deep respiratory effect on oxygenation of patient under major abdominal surgery. 

Design: In this single-blind randomized clinical trial which was done in surgery ward of Shahid Beheshti Hospital in QOM in 2012, forty elective patients who needed major 
abdominal surgery participated in this study and were divided to two equal groups(control and experimental). Control group had been received routine care but experimental 
group in addition of ordinary care, repeated deep respiratory exercise four times an hour for 2 consecutive hours. The arrangement of patients about their position, mobility 
and oxygen therapy were the same. Oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, heart rate, mean blood pressure and the severity of pain in surgery site were measured before and 
after intervention. Chi-square test, Fischer exact test, t-test, Paired t- test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, loan test and Manvitini test were used for data 
analyzing. 
Findings: Before intervention, two groups had no significant difference about demographic characteristics, intermediary factors in oxygenation, the severity of pain in surgery 
site, pulse rate, mean artery blood pressure, respiratory rate ,and O2 saturation(P>0.05).After the intervention, the change of O2 saturation and the severity of pain in surgery 
site were significant (P<0.05).Furthermore the results revealed, the deep respiratory exercise can reduce the pain of surgery site and mean blood pressure and increase the 
O2 saturation in experimental group. 
Conclusion: Deep respiratory exercise can reduce the severity of pain in surgery site and mean artery blood pressure and increase the O2 saturation in patients after major abdominal surgery
