abstract: "This study uses random assignment to evaluate the Building Educated Leaders for Life (BELL) summer learning program. Over 1,000 elementary school children who applied to this program in 2005 were included in the study.  Random assignment results suggest positive impacts on reading and parents encouraging reading.  Quasi-experimental results suggest positive impacts on reading skills similar to the same amount of time in regular school.  No impacts were found on academic-self perceptions or social behaviors. Attendance rates at the program were around 50 percent for the treatment group."
