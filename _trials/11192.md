abstract: "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has increasingly become part of our everyday life. Therefore, it is crucial that young adults start familiarizing themselves with it early. The successful use of AI for humanity strongly relies on the abilities and competencies of the people who develop, implement, and use it. Thus, a fundamental prerequisite to addressing the profound changes that our society faces is educating people with solid digital competencies, among which AI plays a central role. Progressively it will become crucial to understand the mechanisms behind it, and attitudes and knowledge of how AI works. We evaluate a randomized educational intervention that aims to familiarize middle school pupils with AI concepts and stimulate interest in STEM related subjects and careers. A randomly selected sub-sample of classes are granted access to an innovative app for mobile devices (phones and tablets) - “SMaILEApp”. The app aims to teach complex AI techniques to pupils through gamification, breaking down complex concepts into straightforward applications, accessible to a broad spectrum of young users. In line with gamification techniques, the App uses points, credits, rewards, challenges and virtual goods to ensure maximum engagement of the users. The SMaILEApp thus allows students to learn AI by playing. The app is an educational macro-game that contains micro-games, each of which focuses on a specific AI topic, e.g. machine learning, planning, optimization, etc. 

A primary objective of this app is to change attitudes towards AI: the students learn that there are multiple AI sub-areas, each with its strengths and weaknesses, instead of treating AI as a monolithic magic “black box”.

SMaILE app as an educational device has been tested on 57 middle-school classes (second grade of middle school) in 20 schools in the Piemonte region, in Northern Italy. Within each school, half of the classes are randomly assigned the app from the 2022-23 academic year, a pre and post test are carried out, and administrative information from school registries will be collected at the end of the school year to complement the analysis.  We plan to measure how this app changes attitudes and perceptions towards AI, and, in particular, whether students show a more informed view of the role of AI in society, after understanding it better.
