abstract: "We propose to conduct an impact evaluation of an intervention to enhance the efficacy of American Job Centers (AJCs) by focusing on elevating the quality of case management and job search services. Prior work facilitated by a SLII grant has identified this strategy as the most promising approach to help job seekers in Puerto Rico. The plan involves selecting and contracting an external provider of job search and support services from a pool of nationally recognized organizations. This selected provider will offer a comprehensive range of intensive and individualized job search assistance, along with career navigator support. Treatment will be randomized. This initiative is designed to benefit eligible Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) participants who are transitioning out of various programs, namely Adults, Youth, Dislocated Workers, Wagner-Peyser Employment Services. The primary focus of the evaluation will be on assessing the labor market outcomes of these individuals, including their compensation and employment status during the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th and 10th quarters after receiving treatment. By prioritizing the enhancement of case management and job search services, it is anticipated that individuals will experience improved agency and job market opportunities. "
