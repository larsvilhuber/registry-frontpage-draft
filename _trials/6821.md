abstract: "In prior work, we have found that video messages delivered by doctors increase knowledge of COVID-19, and in some cases, lead to viewers taking actions consistent with the messaging.  In a scale-up phase, we plan to use Facebook ads to show a 15 second video clip recorded by 6 MGH, Harvard and Lynn Community health center doctors to approximately 40,000,000 Facebook users.  The ads will be shown between November 14-29 and focus on staying safe â€“ limiting travel, social distancing and mask-wearing. We are randomizing exposure to the ad campaign at the ZIP code and county level to study whether the videos change mobility and Thanksgiving holiday travel and whether there are any detectable impacts on the spread of COVID-19. Using information about Facebook social network connections and mobility patterns between counties, we also plan to measure whether exposure to the ad campaign spilled over along the network.  

Following the completion of the Thanksgiving intervention, we implemented a follow-on Christmas intervention with the same two-stage research design, re-randomized in the same 13 states.  Videos recorded by nurses and physicians encouraging people to stay home for Christmas were again pushed as ads to Facebook users.
