abstract: "A householdâ€™s water usage has negative externalities on current and future users of the resource when water resources are scarce. If piped water is delivered by a water utility, this externality can be addressed by setting the price paid by each user equal to the marginal social cost. However, this is typically infeasible: the best the utility can do is set prices at the household level. If household members are not completely altruistic toward one another or if cooperation fails because of difficulties enforcing individual consumption levels, then individual behavior may only partially internalize the water price faced by the household. This set up motivates our primary research question: Are households with lower levels of cooperation less price sensitive in their water consumption? In other words, is there a tragedy of the commons inside of the household? We gather evidence on this question using a field experiment that varies household beliefs about water prices. In combination with water billing records and measures of intrahousehold cooperation, we test whether externalities within the household lead to lower price sensitivity."
