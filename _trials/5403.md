abstract: "This study examines the effect of election observers taking pictures of result-sheets in constituency tally centres. We focus on the Malawi 2019 general elections, during which we cooperated with domestic election observers to examine the impact of different observer methods. We argue that by taking pictures at crucial points in the results-transmission process, election observers can deter possible attempts to alter vote figures and errors while results are being transmitted and tabulated. To investigate this further we randomly assigned observers to take pictures of result-sheets at constituency tally-centres during the 2019 elections. We further collected data on the election results in each polling station both prior to results being transferred (at polling station level) as well as upon the completion of the result-transmission process (as electoral commission-level). To estimate the impact of our treatment, we will compare the total deviation in results between those polling stations that were assigned to treatment and those that were assigned to the control group.
