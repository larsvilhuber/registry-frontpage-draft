abstract: "We will randomly assign healthcare providers in rural or township hospitals to volunteer, in order to test the effect of volunteering on their turnover (retention), burnout, and performance. Healthcare providers will be randomly assigned to different types of volunteering to assess mechanisms. We register the trial design and analysis plan before the first wave of outcome assessment in June 2024."
