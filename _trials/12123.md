abstract: "Expanding access to quality childcare has the potential to yield multi-generational impacts by improving parents’ economic empowerment, child outcomes, family welfare, business productivity and overall economic growth. However, there is very limited data on childcare available and guidelines on how to collect it across low- and middle-income countries, particu¬larly for children below age 3, and this limits the possible assessment of access of childcare services in developing countries. 

The objective of this project is twofold. First, it aims to advance the understanding of how to obtain better measures of childcare arrangements in developing countries using household surveys, including those informal childcare arrangements that can be overlooked but are crucial to families. Second, it will explore parents’ preferences on childcare services’ attributes. 

The first goal will be addressed by designing and implementing a survey experiment to compare different methods to collect information on household surveys. The evidence on parents’ preferences on childcare services attributes will be obtained from a discrete choice experiment inspired in Datta (2019)."
