abstract: "The Ultra Poor Graduation Pilot in the Philippines is an on-going initiative funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) of the Philippine government and implemented by DOLE and BRAC-USA, a non-profit organization. The graduation approach is a combination of social protection, health, life skills and livelihood programs that offers a holistic package of sequenced interventions aimed at helping the poorest “graduate” into sustainable livelihoods. Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) has completed the baseline survey on 2,400 ultra-poor households in 30 communities across five municipalities in northern Negros Occidental. IPA plans to conduct an endline round of data collection in 2020. "
