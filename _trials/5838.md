abstract: "There is concern worldwide that the coronavirus epidemic will lead to an increase in domestic abuse (DA), as stay-at-home orders force victims to spend more time at home with their abusers.  At the same time, there is concern that the reporting of domestic abuse may fall.  The result is a greater number of victims, increasingly isolated and without recourse. We are working with the Greater Manchester Police (GMP) to devise an outreach campaign targeted toward women at risk of domestic abuse, to inform them how they may safely contact police.  

To measure the impact of the outreach campaign, we are conducting an RCT that randomly assigns geographic areas in Greater Manchester to treatment and control status.  The treatment group is targeted for extra social media advertising that promotes the use of a Live Chat reporting tool; the control group is exposed only to various national campaigns that are ongoing at the same time. Outcomes to be analyzed include calls for service and calls for service by method during the ad campaign, and post-campaign measures of calls for service and incidents involving violence as measures of recidivism.
