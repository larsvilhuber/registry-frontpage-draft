abstract: "Researchers have documented racial and gender gaps in college enrollment decisions, choice of major, degree attainment, and earnings—despite narrowing gaps in test scores and course-taking in K-12 settings. Implicit racial and gender stereotypes of faculty members may affect their interactions with students and exacerbate these gaps, even without awareness or intent to harm members of underrepresented groups. Yet, there is no causal evidence on the extent to which faculty’s implicit bias contributes to these educational disparities and which types of interventions are cost-effective in mitigating any harmful effects of implicit bias on student achievement gaps.This study aims to address implicit bias of faculty members through the collaboration between psychologists and economists. First, we plan to understand the relationship between faculty’s implicit bias and gaps in student achievement, completion, and economic mobility using a newly constructed dataset with schools’ student-level and faculty-level administrative data, and faculty’s implicit association test (IAT) results. Second, we plan to implement a randomized field experiment to evaluate the effects of faculty implicit bias trainings on students' academic performance. Due to schools’ adjustments to online education in March 2020, we will pilot the study using an online format in Fall 2020 at Reynolds Community College and Fall 2021 at other three community colleges. The second pilot will include videos instead of only in-person interaction with psychologists for the implementation of the implicit bias training."
