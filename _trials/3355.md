abstract: "Both strategic and natural uncertainty (risk) determine whether agents receive an economic reward in many environments. Moreover, many environments require repeated decisions. When periods are stochastically independent, do agents respond to an adverse outcome? And does it matter for their response whether the strategic or the natural risk materialized to cause the event?

We design an experimental choice situation that contains both strategic and natural uncertainty and repeat the situation once, after feedback on first-round outcomes. Observing the behavior of experimental subjects in both rounds allows us to investigate whether the experience of a zero-payoff outcome in the first choice situation affects participant's behavior in a second choice situation and whether the source of the zero-payoff matters. Payoffs are determined by joint play between the subject and a co-player in a game of chicken and by the outcome of a lottery draw.  While the rounds are independent in statistical (random rematching) and payoff terms (random determination of payoff-relevant round), casual observation and evidence from cognate experiments suggests that choice behavior is likely to differ depending on whether the zero-payoff event materialized or not. This behavioral response conceivably also differs depending on whether natural or strategic uncertainty is seen as the reason for the zero-payoff event. Our experiment is designed to detect the presence and nature of such behavioral changes. Furthermore, we ask whether age, gender, or educational status can explain observed choices and changes in choices. Finally, we study whether a change in the perception of what caused the outcome mediates the effect of experience on the change in choices."
