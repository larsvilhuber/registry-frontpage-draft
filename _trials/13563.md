abstract: "This research proposal focuses on analyzing the emergence and dynamics of corrupt behavior in interactions that occur in a public goods and services provision environment. Unlike previous studies, where the roles of who is the (potential) corruptor and the framing of the possibility of corruption are rigid, our setting is more general and versatile for studying how corruption arises, initiates, and evolves over time.

Our experimental design is based on a linear public goods game, where participants are organized into groups of four and one is selected as the public official. Participants have the option to make resource transfers in private and public domains, and natural communication among players is allowed in the private domain.

This design allows us to examine how different variables and elements of the environment affect the generation and dynamics of corruption. In particular, we focus on studying how the combination of the possibility of private interaction and the unequal allocation of public resources (both intrinsic elements of modern societies) can contribute to the emergence of this phenomenon. We then explore how these corrupt or non-cooperative relationships evolve over time or with changes in interaction rules. Finally, we investigate the impact of various anti-corruption policies in this more realistic setting. Our central purpose is to contribute empirical evidence for a deeper understanding of the corruption phenomenon and to inform effective policies and mechanisms to prevent it."
