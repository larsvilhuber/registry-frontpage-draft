abstract: "Despite the increased proportion of women in education and leadership positions, gender gaps persist in many areas such as wages, investments and pensions. Factors influencing these discrepancies are manifold, including gender norms and social identity. This research study explores norm-related gender disparities in retirement planning. Using a large-scale online survey experiment in Germany, I will examine how emphasising prevailing gender norms regarding long-term financial decisions in relationships leads to gender differences in outcomes relevant to retirement planning. This research provides important results, especially in the context of gender equity, but also to understand mechanisms to address one of the most important challenges worldwide in the coming years, the changing pension system and increasing poverty in old age."
