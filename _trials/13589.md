abstract: "This trial evaluates a performance-based financing (PBF) program for primary schools in Cameroon. The main goals are to quantify the causal impacts of PBF on outcomes including school governance, teaching quality, school access, and student learning. The trial also aims to isolate the effects of PBF school performance incentives from PBF components which do not depend on school performance.

The evaluation design has two components: 1) A non-experimental comparison of schools eligible for PBF to those not eligible, using methods like difference-in-differences to strengthen causal inference. 2) A cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) that randomly assigns PBF-eligible schools to receive different combinations of PBF funding components: inputs-only (entry and equity bonuses), incentives-only (performance and progress bonuses), or inputs plus incentives. The RCT design will measure the effects of incentives vs. inputs. The RCT design does not have a pure control group."
