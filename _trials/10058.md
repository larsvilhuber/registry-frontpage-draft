abstract: "We design and evaluate a series of RCTs, based on the idea of creating settings with different types of social interactions among students in the educational environment. The interventions are based on designing a set of novel educational curricula on coding, and using them as a backdrop for inducing certain types of interactions. The context of coding allows us to create a learning environment that can mimic the classroom, with exogenous rules for interactions, performance, and rewards. That is, we create our own educational setting where interactions are induced in pre-determined ways within a learning/performance context. The larger RCT has three treatment arms, based on implementing three types of coding curricula that have distinct features and are hypothesized to have distinct effects. In the first arm, we implement a cooperative learning environment within the coding program, with teamwork. In the second arm, we implement a learning environment within the coding program that involves competitive elements. These arms constitute two distinct interventions that are each compared with a third arm, where we implement the same coding program but given individually. A fourth arm serves as pure control. We aim to measure the effect of the interventions on distinct sets of outcomes, including cognitive and non-cognitive skills, competitive and cooperative behavior, beliefs about oneself and others, attitudes towards outgroups (in terms of gender and refugee status), friendship networks, learning outcomes and performance at school. In addition, we use data collected during the program to explore the mechanisms and heterogeneity of treatment effects.
