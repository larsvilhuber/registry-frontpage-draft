abstract: "This RCT examines the impact of two policing innovations in Pakistan: citizen-centric problem-oriented policing (CPOP) and gender inclusive citizen-centric problem-oriented policing (CPOP-G). The CPOP arm incorporates community engagement and problem-oriented
policing. The CPOP-G arm engages women in addition to men. Because local social norms prevent mixed-gender meetings, and because women may not be willing to discuss family and gender-related issues in mixed company, female constables in the CPOP-G arm will
conduct woman-only forums.

The study site is the Sheikhupura Range. Both arms will be piloted in Kasur district and the actual experiment run in Sheikhupura and Nakana districts. Key outcomes are: citizen perceptions of crime and safety; police perceptions of citizens; police activity as measured through surveys and administrative data; and crime levels measured through administrative data. We will use a wide range of administrative data as well as surveys of citizens and police to measure changes in policing practices."
