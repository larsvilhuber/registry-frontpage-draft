abstract: "Despite advancing medical technologies, severe maternal morbidity has increased by about 200 percent over the past few decades (CDC 2021). A recent study found that 4 out of 5 pregnancy-related deaths are preventable. A common cause of maternal mortality is preeclampsia â€“ a dangerous pregnancy and postpartum complication associated with high blood pressure which can result in seizure, organ damage, or stroke. It affects about 1 in 25 pregnant women and causes 15 percent of premature births (CDC 2021). Several interventions have aimed to mitigate the devastating effects of preeclampsia, including the distribution of self-monitoring blood pressure (SMBP) cuffs. Distributing SMBP cuffs may allow for the early detection of possible increases in blood pressure and give women agency within their own health care decisions.

We propose to randomize the distribution of 4500 self-monitoring blood pressure cuffs (SMBP)- across prenatal facilities in the state of Missouri. Using Medicaid data, provider-level surveys, and individual-level SMS surveys, we will assess the impact that the distribution of SMBPs has on the detection and management of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, feelings of empowerment during the prenatal and postpartum periods for vulnerable women, and the detection or management of high blood pressure in other household members through spillover effects.
