abstract: "We study what respondents in Denmark know about their relative income positions in various reference groups. References groups are, among others, education groups, cohorts, sectors, or municipalities. Thanks to the match to administrative data from Statistics Denmark, we can check whether respondents know their relative positions accurately. We randomly provide a subset of respondents with information about their position and see how this changes their views on various policies. "
