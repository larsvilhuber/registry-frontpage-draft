abstract: "Every year, around 4 million referrals are made to Child Protective Services in the United States, involving more than 7 million children. Approximately half of these reports are screened in for investigation. Screened-in referrals are assessed by a caseworker, with support from their supervisor. There are few tools that are available to supervisors to support their practice and encourage rich conversations with caseworkers. A county in the U.S. is planning to launch the CSDA Supervision Tool, a data lead tool developed by professors at UNC-Chapel Hill and Auckland University of Technology and Centre for Social Data Analytics (CSDA). This study will conduct an impact evaluation to assess whether these tools are (i) improving outcomes for families and (ii) not having any adverse outcomes. A key feature of the study will be its focus on treatment heterogeneity by workers' baseline beliefs about the risk distribution of different demographic groups. "
