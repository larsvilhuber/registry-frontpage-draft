abstract: "We study how exogenously being drawn to complete the military service affects people’s beliefs and their identity. We combine a unique natural experiment, the random draw of some people having to complete the military service, with unique survey data on preferences, beliefs and identity. We study whether be- ing randomly assigned to complete the military service changes the likelihood of ever living outside of one’s province of residence at age 17. We also examine whether random assignment to complete the service had a long-lasting impact on people’s national identity, their beliefs, and their personalities. In this pre- analyis plan we specify (i) our main empirical specifications, (ii) the set of out- comes we plan to analyze, (iii) the sample size and inclusion criteria, (iv) power calculations based on pilot data (v) adjustment for multiple hypothesis testing, and (vi) the exact experimental instructions used."
