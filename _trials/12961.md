abstract: "We conduct an adapted version of the study in Ambuehl and Bernheim "Interpreting the Will of the People:
Social Preferences over Ordinal Outcomes" adapted so children can participate. The research question is how children make decisions for groups of other children when a single option needs to be chosen for the group and the latter children have different preferences about which option would be best. We study whether the way in which children make these decisions changes with age.
