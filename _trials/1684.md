abstract: "We study goal setting and the extent to which goals should be flexible, using a large scale survey experiment involving approximately 2000 university students. Using a series of surveys we motivate students to set grade and non-grade related goals. In one treatment (T3) we explicitly mention that students can change their goals later. In the two other treatments (T1 and T2) we do not mention the option to change goals later. In the second survey, after students received information on their performance, we remind the students on their goals. In treatment 2 and 3, students are then asked whether they would like to change their goals (and why). We can then measure whether goals should be set flexibly, and whether this flexibility should come as a surprise. Since we have rich data on intermediate performance, final performance, and personal characteristics we are also able to estimate for whom goal setting works (in terms of present bias preferences and loss aversion, as is theoretically predicted to interact with the success of goal setting), and under which condition one should deviate from the initial goal. Furthermore, we can estimate the effects of goal flexibility on goal motivation."
