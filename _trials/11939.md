abstract: "This study examines the effects of scalable, personalized email feedback on students at a large public institution in the US. We aim to discern which feedback types most significantly influence student learning and retention, specifically identifying the content that most likely alters student behavior. Our research closely mirrors the experiment presented in the working paper “The Effect of Feedback on Student Performance” by Esteban Aucejo and Kelvin Wong.

Our analysis seeks to validate these findings in an environment where the pandemic does not influence classes (Fall 2023). The pandemic led to diminished interactions between students and professors due to the reliance on platforms like Zoom for instruction. In such a scenario, personalized feedback emails might have held greater significance for students, potentially resulting in more pronounced effects.

We aim to evaluate the varied effects of feedback messages on three distinct student groups:

a) First-generation students (those whose parents did not attend college) versus non-first-generation students, 
b) Over-optimistic students (defined by the disparity between their expected class rank and their rank after the first exam) versus their non-overoptimistic counterparts, 
c) Mode of instruction students received: traditional in-person, hybrid, or online classes.

To gauge the influence of feedback, we will evaluate both educational outcomes and qualitative student responses. We will explore students' perceptions of personalized feedback messages and determine how their beliefs shift post-feedback.
