abstract: "Research shows that a significant proportion of mental health disorders surface in early childhood and adolescent years. Systematic reviews show that interventions focused on student mental health can have promising effects on mental health and education outcomes of children. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) interventions are one such intervention. However, there is little evidence on the impact of MBSR programmes on student mental health and education outcomes, or on the mechanisms through which they operate. This gap in evidence is particularly stark in lower-middle income countries. This project aims to design and test the impact of an MBSR curriculum in the context of low-cost private schools in Pakistan through a pilot. We aim to answer two key questions: What is the impact of MBSR on the mental health, psychological outcomes, and education outcomes of young people? What are the underlying mechanisms through which MBSR impacts young people? We aim to, develop a proof-of-concept of our intervention design, and produce evaluation results from the pilot. The research embedded in the pilot will result in a paper identifying key lessons and findings, providing a pathway to scale. The findings from this evaluation will generate rigorous causal evidence and contribute to the limited (but growing) literature on the impact of mental health interventions for youth.
