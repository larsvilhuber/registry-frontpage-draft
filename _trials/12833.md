abstract: "Numerous studies in the field of discrimination research find discrimination in the hiring process of applicants from ethnic minorities (e.g. Bertrand and Duflo 2017, Carlson and Roth 2006; Kaas and Manger 2011, SVR 2014). Apart from an observational study from Norway (Helland and Støren 2006), little is known about pre K-12 discrimination against students who apply for an apprenticeship or vocational training when leaving middle school. Although ten-thousands are enrolled in this type of Vocational Training with cooperation and businesses, it has not yet been researched whether certificates of prior economic knowledge can mitigate the disadvantages of preference-based discrimination (e.g. rascism). We conducted a field experiment to examine these research questions with empirical data.
In a randomized, controlled study, starting in spring of 2024, we sent around 8 k email inquiries in three business sectors (public administration, industry and services) to companies that had reported training positions to local job centers in German cities. We block-randomized the treatments into (5*2*2*2 = 50) dimensions at the level of industries and federal states: First, we varied the migration background (German, Turkish, Russian, Arab and Jewish) of the applicants by choosing German, Turkish or Russian or Israeli or Arab given sounding names. Second, we varied the gender (female vs. male) of the applicants. Third, we varied the expected grade point average (very good vs. satisfactory) after 10 years of school with the completion of the technical college entrance qualification. The fourth treatment dimension varied previous economic knowledge acquired in an internship.
