abstract: "In this project, we investigate whether the experience of success or failure in a high stakes environment has heterogeneous effects on confidence in abilities and willingness to compete by gender, ability and parental education. Using the central application procedure for study places in the medical fields in Germany, we study how the (non-)assigment of a study place through this procedure influences ability beliefs and the willingness to compete in an application-relevant ability domain. Secondary analyses will focus on the interaction of application outcome and randomized feedback. 
We attempt to follow two identification strategies. Our first identification strategy relies on a regression discontinuity design that uses application scores in the three admission quotas as running variable and incentivized survey measures administered after applicants are informed about the outcome of their application as outcomes. Our second identification strategy relies on a difference-in-differences analysis of incentivized survey measures administered before and after applicants are informed.
