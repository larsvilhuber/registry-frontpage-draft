abstract: "What role does front-line workers' motivation play in known heuristics affecting their decision making with clients? Will different types of motivation, for example, reduce or increase biases and discrimination?

Previous research suggests that when front-line workers face deservingness relevant cues in interaction with clients a psychological `deservingness heuristic' is triggered causing front-line workers to think about their decisions in terms of who deserves help - disregarding recognized legal or political standards. 

The study examines this claim by drawing on data from a conjoint experiment embedded in a large-scale survey among Danish social workers."
