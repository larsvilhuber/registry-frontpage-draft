abstract: "In previous decades of rising economic inequality, the developed world saw various local, regional, and even national governments enact regulatory new or higher minimum wage policies to increase wages for those at the bottom of the income ladder. More recently, other government programs are testing universal basic income (UBI) payment to fight poverty. Both a minimum wage and UBI will require public support for plausible implementation, and both are forms of redistribution that donâ€™t rely on means tested welfare benefits. Political and economic literature suggests numeric anchoring of a policy can influence public preferences, and even a policy proposal frame can shape individual preferences for adjacent policies. This raises the question of how a higher proposed minimum wage affects support for the wage floor and other forms of redistribution, such as UBI. We posit an increase in minimum wage can influence public attitudes, specifically a large monetary increase in the wage floor will reduce support for other economic redistribution policies, including UBI.  A randomized choice experiment will test these theories by assigning American respondents to different informational treatments. Our experimental design allows us to estimate two contributions to the literature. First, we examine the causal effects of anchoring the federal minimum wage proposals on public attitudes toward the wage floor. Second, we will explore how minimum wage increases lead to spillover effects on public support for UBI and other redistributive policies.   "
