abstract: "The majority of children who attend preschool in poor countries attend informal ones, which are often staffed by teachers with low levels of education and minimal formal training. We evaluate a government program in Malawi, which focused on improving quality at community-based childcare centers (CBCCs) and complemented these efforts with a group-based parenting support program. The study, which is a cluster-randomized controlled trial with four arms, covers 199 CBCCs in four districts of Malawi."
