abstract: "Bureaucracies often provide training to staff. However, the efficacy and outcome of such training remain unclear due to a misalignment between the professional knowledge imparted by the trainer and the preferences of the trainee. To address this issue, we propose and test two distinct mechanisms of knowledge delivery: one in which trainees receive information exclusively from the trainer, and another where the knowledge is sourced from materials more closely aligned with the trainees' preferences. We plan to conduct a large-scale randomized trial to evaluate the impact of these information delivery mechanisms. The study will take place in China and will leverage a newly developed smartphone mini-program that not only facilitates training but also registers the professional judgments and performances of the participants. Recruitment for the study is currently in progress, with the experiment slated to commence in late October and early November 2023."
