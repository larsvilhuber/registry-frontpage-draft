abstract: "We study partisan differences in Americans' response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Political leaders and media outlets on the right and left have sent divergent messages about the severity of the crisis, and this could potentially undermine public compliance with key measures such as social distancing. Using a nationally-representative sample of Americans, we test whether there are partisan gaps between Republicans and Democrats in perceived risks of COVID-19, in social distancing, in media consumption, and in predictions of future cases. We test how differences in beliefs and actions about COVID-19 are related to differences in political attitudes. We test whether differences in beliefs are due to partisan cheerleading by randomly varying whether predictions are incentivized."
