abstract: "The Microeconomics, Institutional and Development Impact Division of the African Development Bank proposes to conduct a three-year research and outreach program to explore whether grain quality certification at the smallholder level can significantly enhance farm income and resilience for food and nutrition. Of primary interest is whether improved smallholder knowledge of the quality of their grain and independent third-party certification of this quality will strengthen smallholder market power, allowing them to obtain higher prices. There is emerging evidence that quality certification can markedly increase prices received by farmers, incentivizing their investment in quality-enhancing inputs and practices. Our research could lead to several positive results, including empowering smallholders in marketing negotiations, allowing them to receive higher prices; and encouraging uptake of technologies that could increase production and resilience of grain suitable for high-value processing and exportation. The research team will build capacity in Ghana through extensive outreach aimed at a wide range of stakeholders including the farmers, brokers, processors, Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Ghana commodity exchange, Ghana Grains Council, Ghana Standards Authority, and through educational initiatives involving the University of Ghanaâ€™s Ph.D program in Applied Agricultural Economics and Policy."
