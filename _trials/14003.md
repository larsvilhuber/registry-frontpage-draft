abstract: "Like other weather-related disasters, the occurrence of severe wildfires is growing throughout North America. This escalating risk can be mitigated through efforts by property owners to manage vegetation and other flammable material near homes. Despite the cost-effectiveness
of these investments, take-up is low. There are several economic and psychological theories for why beneficial self-protective investments in wildfire readiness could have low take-up despite their likely cost-effectiveness: these could include lack of information, complexity and psychological frictions, credit/cash constraints, and spatial externalities across neighboring properties. We propose to conduct a study to identify interventions to address these barriers. We will randomize households in areas with high wildfire risk to receive (1) information about existing resources to support defensible space (e.g., a home assessment from the local fire department) and (2) information about existing
resources and a financial incentive. We will also have a pure control group that will not receive any outreach. ."
