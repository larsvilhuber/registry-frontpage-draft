abstract: "One of the most prominent disparities in labor markets is the gender wage gap. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, women’s median weekly earnings were approximately 82% of men’s median weekly earnings in 2019 for full-time workers. While factors such as education, experience, occupations, union status, discrimination, and more account for a large part of the gender gap, a significant part of the gap remains unexplained. At the same time, there is ample evidence that individual choices are affected by the composition of the menu of available alternatives, i.e., that preferences are context-dependent. These so-called menu effects could influence important decisions in the labor market, such as career or contract choice, potentially exacerbating wage disparities among different demographic groups.
The goal of this project is to explore gender differences in choice over labor contracts due to menu effects and measure its potential contribution to the wage gap.  To do so, we will run an experiment on a sample of the US population aimed at identifying and measuring gender differences in menu effects with real-effort tasks that vary in pay and flexibility/duration. The project will also look at whether existing theories of context-dependent preferences can explain the data and estimate the distribution of preferences."
