abstract: "Most manufacturing firms in the developing world rely on informally sourced referrals to recruit workers for entry-level jobs. Given homophilous networks, this practice may undermine diversity, and may contribute to occupational segregation. Does seeding more referrals amongst under-represented workers improve diversity, firm productivity, social cohesion within teams and worker retention? I study this in the context of India, where job search networks are concentrated by caste. I partner with a large manufacturing firm to experimentally vary their referral allocation process. In treatment teams, referrals are seeded disproportionately among incumbent lower caste workers. The study will focus on productivity, labor turnover, social cohesion and bargaining power as the key outcomes of interest.
