abstract: "Norm nudges have been an influential marketing and political strategy to promote desirable behavior. We conduct a randomized controlled trial to examine how people make an effort subsequently after being nudged with peer information towards behavioural change through goal setting. Do people internalize the value of the goal or do they simply conform? We find that while nudging leads to a higher sign-up rate relative to the baseline without nudging, it does not always improve performance and can even lead to a lower effort when there is a lack of intrinsic motivation.
