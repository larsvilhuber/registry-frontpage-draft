abstract: "We propose to conduct a two-year randomized field experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of a curricular civic education intervention on college-age students and the middle school students they mentor in Mexico. Evaluating which policies can support democracy in a period of democratic backsliding is extremely important, but rigorous evidence on the causal effects of civic education on democratic behaviors is scarce. We will implement such a course in Mexico, a large country of great strategic importance to the US, where democratic institutions are being rapidly undermined (Krauze, 2023). Specifically, the project aims to test hypotheses on the following questions: 1. To what extent can civic education strengthen democratic values and behaviors such as attitudes towards democracy, tolerant behaviors, and participation in democratic processes? 2. Can civic education be effectively delivered remotely in a scalable way?
