abstract: "Development interventions are often designed from independent perspectives that prioritize individualism, personal achievement and self-reliance, while individuals in non-Western countries are more likely to relate to interdependent values such as collective well-being, collaboration and traditions. Inspired by previous research, we have developed a “progress with your goals” curriculum that aims to help women to save. We created two versions, one incorporates an independent framing and the other incorporates an interdependent framing. Together with Tinh Thuong Microfinance Organization (TYM), a Vietnamese microfinance institution, we organize a field experiment to study the effect of the training and its different framings on women’s savings and preferences for competition."
