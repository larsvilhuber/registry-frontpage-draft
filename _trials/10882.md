abstract: "We examine the productivity effects of a new artificial intelligence technology—large language models—in the context of creative tasks. In an online experiment, we assign occupation-specific writing tasks to a variety of college-educated professionals, and randomly expose half of them to the assistive chatbot ChatGPT. We examine takeup of ChatGPT, effects on productivity and output quality, complementarity with baseline ability, effects on task structure, skill demand, and the distribution of ideas, and effects on job satisfaction, self-efficacy, and automation concerns.
