abstract: "At the end of middle school, many low-achieving students have to abandon hope of getting into selective high-school programs, which may be a source of disengagement and eventually lead them to drop out of high school. Based on a randomized controlled trial, this paper shows that low-achievers can be helped to formulate educational objectives that fit better with their academic aptitudes, through a series of meetings facilitated by the school principals. By affecting high school plans of the less realistic fraction of students, the intervention is able to reduce grade repetition and high-school dropout by 25% to 40%. "
