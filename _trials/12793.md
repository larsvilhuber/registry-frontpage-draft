abstract: "This project aims to study the impact of a large one-time cash transfer to families with children who are accessing emergency homeless services. The project will evaluate how such a cash transfer impacts future homelessness and other indicators of housing stability. We also plan to study how the assistance affects recipients' self-reported well-being and mental health, labor market participation, use of other government programs, criminal justice contact, and children's educational outcomes.
