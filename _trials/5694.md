abstract: "The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of different COVID-19 communication strategies on peopleâ€™s willingness to engage in public health behaviors like hand-washing or social distancing. While there is some initial evidence about message content, little is known about whether the source of a message itself affects the credibility people assign to the message content, and their willingness to practice hand hygiene and social distancing. We further argue that the source credibility of public health risk communication can be judged among two dimensions, expertise and relevance. In this study, we focus on varying the perceived relevance of the source of a hypothetical, but realistic, social media post."
