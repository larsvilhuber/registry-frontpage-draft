abstract: "We conducted an online survey among a sample of the U.S. population to gauge their attitudes toward a police technology. Using a survey experiment, we investigated the extent to which individuals' support or opposition to the technology would be influenced by presenting them with information about their own predictions and the predictions of experts regarding the impact of widely publicized incidents of police killings on the stock performance of companies that contract with police.
