abstract: "China’s economic rise is arguably one of the most significant economic events of the past four decades. However, its opening up and liberalization have also created new inequalities. As China’s growth slows and inequality becomes more pronounced, redistributive policies have entered public discussion. A crucial question arises: how does the average Chinese person view those who have become wealthy over the past 40 years? Do they consider their wealth fair, or do they call for redistributive measures? This project builds on a pilot survey experiment we conducted in 2021, in which we found that priming–via vignettes–getting rich via relatively less meritocratic, yet representative ways under market transition in post-reform China - such as inheritance, housing arbitrage, or house demolition compensation - significantly reduces redistributive support, and in particular support for policies taking from the rich, while one may have a priori expected the opposite to happen. To verify the results of the pilot, we run a RCT on a representative sample of 2,000 Chinese respondents, replicating the priming treatment on a randomly-drawn subsample of 1,000 respondents. To better understand the results, we ask treated and control respondents what factors they think are the main sources of wealth in today’s society, as well as the sources of wealth of the individuals in the examples.
