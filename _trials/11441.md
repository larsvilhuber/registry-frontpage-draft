abstract: "The purpose of the study is to understand students' career motivations, particularly the value they attach to various job features such as flexibility, environmental friendliness, gender equality, and working for a civic-minded company. 

The objectives of this study are (i) to obtain a salary equivalent to the students' valuation of these job amenities; (ii) examine the extent to which students are able to predict their peer’s average choices; (iii) estimate peer effects, also translated into salary equivalents; (iv) study the variation of these willingnesses to pay (WTP) according to both group and individual characteristics. 

This is a choice experiment between pairs of jobs A and B characterized by different amenities and different wage levels; for each such vignette, the subject is asked to state the probability that they would choose job A vs. job B and predict their peer’s choices (with an incentive for accuracy). Within the choices made by the students, we will also seek to distinguish what is based on their deep and personal preferences and what is based on conformity with peer’s choices. To do this, the experiment will include two arms: a treatment group in which information about the A/B choice probabilities of another previously interviewed group will be provided to them before they can make their own choices, and a control group without prior information.
