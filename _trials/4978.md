abstract: "The field experiment consists of a randomized control trial (RCT) in which two active labor market policies were randomly offered to unemployed workers in the fifth month of unemployment insurance receipt: a traditional job search assistance program (JSA, offered to 660 job seekers) or a reemployment voucher (RV, offered to 754 job seekers) consisting of a bonus for a specialized third party service provider (a lump sum payment of up to 5000 euros) if the provider successfully matches a job seeker with a new employer within six months. A third group of 1400 randomly-selected job seekers from the same population was assigned to a control group, which could not received JSA or RV for a period of six months."
