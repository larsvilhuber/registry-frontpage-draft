abstract: "In two field experiments, we find standard default effects in higher education: changing the exam sign-up procedure from opt-in to opt-out increases the proximal outcome exam sign-up. Downstream, exam participation increases when automatic sign-up applies to a single exam rather than many exams, yet on average neither intervention yields effects on exam passing. Heterogeneities are large. Responsive students benefit, and convert the increased sign-ups into passed exams. For non-responsive students, the increased sign-ups result in failed exams due to no-shows. Defaults can thus move even outcomes which require substantial post-intervention effort, but policy-makers need to carefully consider whom to target.
