abstract: "In this project, we investigate whether (anticipated) economic policies of one U.S. presidential candidate (Donald J. Trump, DJT) influence households’ economic expectations. We plan to administer high-frequency surveys (twice or three (or more) times a week) throughout the election cycle to study the dynamics of expectations. DJT’s winning probability will change over the election process, which allows us to identify the relationship between his winning probability and the change in economic expectations. "
