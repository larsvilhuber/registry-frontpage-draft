abstract: "Objectives. To evaluate a community-informed mobile phone intervention (mivacunaLA/myshotLA) to increase COVID-19 vaccination among Latino families in communities with low vaccine uptake and high rates of COVID-19 transmission.
Methods. We conducted a randomized controlled trial with a wait-list control group among Latino parents/caregivers with at least one unvaccinated child in East and South Los Angeles in the summer of 2021 to measure the effectiveness of mivacunaLA, a community-partnered intervention to promote vaccine uptake by addressing misinformation and building trust. 
Results. A difference-in-difference analysis showed that Latino parents/caregivers that participated in mivacunaLA/myshotLA (n=246) were 12% points more likely (p=0.03) to report a positive intention to vaccinate their children aged 2-11 (when COVID-19 vaccines became available) and 15% points more likely (p=0.04) to report vaccination of their children aged 12-17, than controls.
Conclusions. Mobile phone delivered interventions using videos and culturally tailored educational material to promote COVID-19 vaccine confidence appears to be an effective way to combat misinformation and deliver timely information to marginalized communities. Community partnerships in research are important to advance health equity among those impacted most by the COVID-19 pandemic. "
