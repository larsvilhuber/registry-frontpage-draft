abstract: "Microfinance institutions have started to bundle their basic loans with other financial services, such as health insurance.  Using a randomized control trial in Karnataka, India, this project evaluates the impact of mandating the purchase of actuarially-fair health insurance covering hospitalization and maternity expenses on health and financial outcomes.  

As bundling loans with insurance led to a decline in the renewal of microfinance loans, with many clients preferring to give up microfinance than to pay higher interest rates and receive insurance, we also examine the effects of non-renewal.
