abstract: "We analyzed the effect of incentive-framing on performance in employment relations. If loss-aversion holds true, framing an incentive for employees as loss should lead to higher effort than framing the incentive as gain. However, current research sheds doubts on the universality of loss aversion. In most field settings, loss-framings do not increase performance as expected. Our results contribute to the understanding of the boundary conditions of loss-framings. Although loss-framings lead to increased performance among less-productive employees, they simultaneously lead to decreased performance among high-productive employees. Contrarily, gain-framings do not increase performance among less-productive employees but increase productivity among high-productive employees"
