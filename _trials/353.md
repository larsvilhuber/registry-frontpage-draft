abstract: "We conducted a multisite randomized experiment in ten large and economically diverse school districts to test a novel approach to raising teacher quality in struggling schools. The intervention identified high-performing teachers using value-added measures (estimated impact of teachers on student test scores) in tested grades and subjects (math and reading or English language arts in grades 3 through 8) in each district and offered them $20,000 if they transferred to low-achieving schools and stayed there for at least two years. We randomly assigned teaching teams (grades in elementary schools and grade-subject combinations in middle schools) with vacancies within the low-achieving schools to a treatment group that are eligible to hire the high-performing teachers and a control group that will hire teachers as they normally do. The intervention had positive impacts on test scores in elementary schools, but not middle schools. Once recruited, high-performing teachers remained in their new schools at rates comparable to the control group. We also provide estimates of cost effectiveness showing large positive net benefits under plausible assumptions."
