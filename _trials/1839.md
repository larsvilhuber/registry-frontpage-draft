abstract: "How best to help people move from welfare to work--particularly whether an employment-focused approach or an education-focused approach is more effective--has been a subject of long-standing debate. The National Evaluation of Welfare-to-Work Strategies (NEWWS), a multi-year study of alternative approaches to helping welfare recipients find jobs, advance in employment, and leave public assistance, compared the effects of two alternative pre-employment strategies, for different groups of welfare recipients: programs that emphasize short-term job search assistance and encourage people to find employment quickly (referred to as "Labor Force Attachment" or, more broadly, "employment-focused" programs); and programs that emphasize longer-term skill-building activities, primarily basic education (referred to as "Human Capital Development" or, more broadly, "education-focused" programs). The primary research question addressed was: What works best for whom?

The effects of each approach were estimated using a multi-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT).  Over 55,000 single parents (mostly mothers) were randomly assigned to different treatments, including different program groups (with services) or control groups (without services).  A wealth of information was collected pertaining to the adults and their children, over a five-year follow-up period (falling somewhere between 1991 and 1999, depending on the site).  The study also includes a cost-benefit analysis."
