abstract: "We study the effect of providing information about educational inequality on people’s perceptions of whether it is mainly luck or effort that determines economic and educational success and on support for equity-enhancing (policy) actions. For that purpose, we implement a survey experiment among a representative sample of German adults (18 years and older) where we provide treatment group members with factual information about the association between parents’ socioeconomic status and their children’s educational attainment. By comparing responses between the uninformed control group and the informed treatment groups, we evaluate whether information affects (i) peoples’ perceptions of the relative role of luck vs. effort, (ii) peoples’ preferences towards equity-enhancing education policies and (iii) peoples’ willingness to donate real money to charities supporting educational equality."
