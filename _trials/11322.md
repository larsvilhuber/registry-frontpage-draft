abstract: "We conduct a correspondence test in the housing market to determine the extent of ethnic discrimination and the role of stereotypes expressed through images posted on a social media platform. Fictitious applications with a randomly assigned Turkish- or German-sounding male name are sent to vacant room ads. We randomly add a link to a social media profile to determine the effect of such personal information on callback rates. This social media profile may either foster or not foster Turkish male stereotypes. The profiles built on the profiles used in AEARCTR-0007627 and vary their content by some of them including additional visual material (photos and videos) that signal religious beliefs and cultural orientation to thus identify the role of the content of social media information on ethnic discrimination. We carefully constructed these fictional social media accounts on Instagram to make them as realistic as possible, and conducted several surveys among young people to ensure that the profiles were close to reality with a sufficient number of followers. In addition, we can approximate whether landlords or roommates visit these profiles and exploit this information using statistics on profile visits and page impressions."
