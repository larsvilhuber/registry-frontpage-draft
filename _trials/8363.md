abstract: "We study the effects of an innovative tool for workers’ skills self-assessment and skills matching on individuals’ retraining choices, job search strategies and employment outcomes. Unemployed individuals who contact job centres to start their paperwork qualify as potential participants. Invited unemployed who agree to take part into the study will be randomised into receiving an invitation for our treatment, that is registering to an online platform that provides them with highly individualised information on their skills and skill-match within different occupations of their interest. The remaining individuals will be invited to register to a placebo website that only supplies aggregate information on a set of occupations. We expect those in the treatment group to increase their awareness on their current skill level, as well as align their expectations with the current labor market trends. Furthermore, we expect to find a positive effect on the likelihood that individuals retrain and search for occupations suited to their skills, even if in a sector/occupational category different from what they did in the past. This registration is for a pilot study, which we plan to then scale up. The pilot will happen in two job centres. In one of them, we will also randomise participants into having a phone conversation with a case worker, to measure the extent to which the actual interaction with caseworkers has an effect beyond that of the technology. By embedding our experiment within the organisational processes of the employment center, we will also test the effect of the technology on the job center organisational efficiency. On average, we expect treated individuals randomly selected for the call to achieve (weakly) better employment outcomes than control individuals selected for the call: during the phone conversation, case workers who can take advantage of the individualised information produced by the treatment platform on their users should provide more effective help and be a complement of the technology. In the other job centre, all the participants will have a conversation with a case worker. "
