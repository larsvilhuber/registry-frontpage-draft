abstract: "We field a randomized control trial (RCT) with information treatments related
to green investing. We split the sample randomly into a control group with approximately 2,000
(untreated) respondents and four treatment groups with approximately 1,000 respondents each.
Respondents in each treatment group were shown a brief information statement before answering
our questions. The treatments provided information on risk-return trade-offs in risky investments (T1), the past performance of green and traditional equity (T2), the investment freedom of traditional equity funds (T3), and the potential for green equity to contribute to climate change mitigation (T4). Respondents in the control group receive no information. Post treatment, we elicit in particular respondents' expected returns for green and traditional equity. "
