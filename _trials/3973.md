abstract: "This study uses a framed field experiment to study ways to increase the adoption of conservation agriculture (CA) technologies in Ghana. The fact that CA practices often result in production benefits only after several consecutive seasons of adoption creates a two-fold challenge. First, it is difficult to convince farmers to invest over multiple seasons without a payoff, and second, evaluation of any strategies is complicated by the four season or more time frame that is needed. Our study addresses the first issue by studying both multi-season incentives in an environment of uncertainty over when payoffs will occur and information on the adoption decisions of peers. To address the second issue, we conduct a framed field experiment, allowing us to simulate many different seasons of implementation in a single session. The results can be used to inform randomized impact evaluations of similar programs."
