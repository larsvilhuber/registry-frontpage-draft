abstract: "The link between poor diet and rising rates of obesity and chronic disease is well documented. In efforts to improve diet quality, targeted sin taxes on sugar sweetened beverages and/or other unhealthy products have been levied in locales worldwide. 

Research has revealed that the way taxes are implemented can influence consumer behavior. Sin taxes on selected ingredients usually raise market prices of products containing those ingredients. However, the taxes may not be salient and/or clearly identifiable to consumers. Similarly, taxes that are only added at the time of payment, as opposed to being added to price tags on shelves, may be less effective. 

Since a highly salient and clearly delineated sin tax provides a signal to consumers that the government considers the taxed foods to be less healthy, sin taxes may be effective in reducing consumption even if suppliers were to absorb the tax and not raise prices. However, consumers who are not supportive of the tax may be least likely to moderate their purchases and could even increase purchases as a form of protest.

In light of the above, we propose to conduct a four arm randomized controlled trial via novel web-based grocery store and a 20% tax to test the following hypotheses:

1.	Targeted sin taxes that result in higher prices will reduce demand for taxed products.
2.	The effectiveness of a tax is greater if the tax is salient and clearly delineated. 
3.	A salient and clearly delineated sin tax will reduce demand for the taxed products even if there is no price increase. 
4.	Demand responses for salient and clearly delineated taxes will be moderated by the level of support for the tax, with those who actively support (oppose) the tax showing greater (smaller) reductions in purchases than when the tax is not prominently displayed.
