abstract: "Adoption of productivity-enhancing technologies, such as the Push-pull technology (PPT) remains limited despite the promotional efforts by icipe and partners necessitating sustainable interventions to address barriers to adoption and impact at scale. Liquidity constraints, uncertainties and lack of reliable and persuasive sources of information about new technologies, their benefits and relevance to local agronomic conditions and details on how to apply the technologies are some of the barriers to their adoption. Smallholder farmers often make technology adoption decisions under uncertainty about the costs or benefits of subsequent investments in the technology after the initial take-up. Subsequent investment in technologies are likely to be low when the technology is perennial in nature such as the PPT. Self-learning may play an important role in reducing uncertainties that influence adoption and investment. We use a field experiment to test whether relaxing liquidity and informational barriers through credit subsidy and performance rewards (to ensure self-learning) can increase adoption (and subsequent investment) of a new technology. The specific objectives include:
1)	Test for effect of variations in credit subsidy and incentives (performance rewards) on decision to take up the technology in the presence of uncertainty about the costs and beneÔ¨Åts PPT. 
2)	Test the effect of variations in incentives (performance rewards ) to subsequent investment in PPT after initial take up of the technology
