abstract: "This paper discusses findings from a randomized evaluation of an online teacher training program in Bangladesh implemented during COVID-related school closures. Sixth grade math teachers were invited to a three-month online training program for math competencies and pedagogy. One treatment group was invited to participate in the training, the other was also offered a moderate financial incentive tied to performance on an assessment at the end of the training. Short-term results show positive impacts of the program on math knowledge, lesson delivery, and professional burnout two to three months after taking part. In this paper, we will explore long-term impacts of the program on math knowledge, burnout, and teacher self-efficacy, fifteen months later.  "
