abstract: "In 2009-2012, Blattman, Jamison, and Sheridan, worked with the Liberian NGO Network for Empowerment & Progressive Initiative (NEPI) and the research non-profit Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) to study the impact of a short, inexpensive, intensive therapy program informed by cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on young menâ€™s violent and criminal behavior. Cash alone and therapy alone initially reduced crime and violence, but effects dissipated over time. When cash followed therapy, crime and violence decreased dramatically for at least a year (Blattman et al., 2017). Based on these promising findings, as well as those of a similar program in Chicago (Heller et al., 2016), CBT interventions have been replicated around the globe in efforts to reduce violence and criminal behavior. There is no long term evidence on these programs, however. This pre-registration is for a ten-year follow-up in order to track long-term effects of the CBT and the cash interventions in Liberia.
