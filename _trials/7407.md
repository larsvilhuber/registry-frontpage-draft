abstract: "The Northwest Ohio Fatherhood Connection Project (NWOFC) provides a variety of intensive and coordinated approaches that empower low-income fathers develop skills that help the individual meet the physical, mental, emotional and financial needs of their children through a holistic service delivery approach. Interventions will promote: (a) Healthy Marriage, (b) Responsible Parenting, (c) Economic Stability and (d) Job Driven Employment Pathways. NWOFC aims to serve 175 low-income fathers per year (875 fathers over the course of the 5-year grant period). Fathers will be 18 years of age and older and will have children 24 years of age or younger. In addition to participating in the Nurturing Fathers curriculum, Marriage and Parenting Program (MA/PA), EMPATH mobility mentoring, and economic stability services, participants will be randomly assigned to the treatment condition (e.g., short-term employment training) or the control condition (usual services:  workforce development services). NWOFC research will evaluate the implementation of the program including referral sources, enrollment demographics, and program component delivery. Additionally, we will assess (a) which program components (e.g., job-training program) are associated with better employment outcomes for participants; (b) whether there is a dose-response effect for NWOFC participation; (c) what NWOFC supports (e.g., transportation, peer support, recovery housing) are associated with better economic stability outcomes; and (d) the impact of mobility mentoring on participantsâ€™ economic stability.
