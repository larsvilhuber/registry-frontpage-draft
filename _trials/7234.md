abstract: "The goal of our study is to understand the effect of showing information about peer behavior on decision making. The context that we will try to emulate in our study is that of online peer-to-peer lending (P2P lending), one type of crowdfunding market, where one funding request is typically fulfilled by many investors. Some platforms show detailed information about previous decisions, such as who invested how much at what time. Other platforms show much less information, e.g., only how much cumulatively has been funded. We want to understand how different levels of information affect the decision-making behavior of potential investors, using subjects to be recruited on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk)."
