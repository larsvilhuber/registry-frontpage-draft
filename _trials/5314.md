abstract: "B2B data markets, such as the ‘Data Intelligence Hub’ by Deutsche Telekom or the ‘Open Data Initiative’ by Adobe, Microsoft, and SAP seek to facilitate the exchange of data between firms. Data sharing is believed to promote firms’ ability to innovate and compete. However, many of these initiatives struggle to get off the ground, in part, because a public goods problem may arise. Thereby firms find it beneficial to use other firms’ data, but are reluctant to share their own data, because they fear that this may give them a relative competitive advantage. However, robust economic insights on how to design B2B data markets in order to facilitate data exchange and trust is scant. To this end, we first develop a simple game-theoretic framework to model the strategic interaction in B2B data markets. Based on this framework, we seek to conduct a series of economic laboratory experiments, in which we systematically vary design parameters of B2B data markets in order to study how they impact firms’ incentives to share data. In particular, we investigate how the dimensions control and transparency affect the willingness to share data. In the control dimension, we consider the extent to which a company can control which other companies receive how much of its data. In the transparency dimension, we consider the extent to which the company is informed about data exchange between other companies."
