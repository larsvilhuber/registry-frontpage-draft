abstract: "This study investigates whether consumers' preferences between Internet of Things products that are either transparent about the probability of privacy risk or not transparent depend on the magnitude of the communicated risk probability. In an online experiment, we ask subjects to state their preference between an internet-connected security camera for their home that is transparent about the involved privacy risks (i.e., the share of devices of the same brand that have been hacked in the past) and a security camera that is not transparent about these privacy risks (i.e., no information about the probability of past hacks is given). In a between-subjects treatment design, we vary the general risk probability of a hack between ten percent and fifty percent. In particular, this online experiment tests the external validity of findings on subjects' ambiguity preferences in the context of privacy risks from an earlier laboratory experiment (Sachs & Schnurr, 2022, https://doi.org/10.1257/rct.8066-1.0)."
