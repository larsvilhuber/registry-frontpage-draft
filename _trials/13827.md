abstract: "In a previous experiment (https://doi.org/10.1257/rct.3617-1.1) we tested whether people engage in "moral motive selection", choosing to adhere to the moral motive that aligns with their self-interest. In this project, we (a) replicate our original laboratory experiment in an online setting, (b) test whether restricting the action space affects moral motive selection and (c) test for spillover effects in new ways."
