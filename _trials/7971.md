abstract: "This study is an artefactual lab experiment in the field to understand how individuals form beliefs around social norms and to evaluate whether digital solutions to raising awareness around gender equality are able to influence beliefs around these norms.  Specifically, using lab-in-the-field settings in Paraguay, we test whether the digital app developed by Fundación Capital – IgualdApp – has a differential impact on individual and common beliefs on three domains of gender norms (traditional gender roles, violence against women, and sexual and reproductive health and rights) compared to conventional informational awareness products. To be eligible for inclusion in the study, women must be beneficiaries of the Abrazo program, a child-care program run by Paraguay’s Ministry of Children and Adolescents with which Fundación Capital is partnering to provide mothers with social protection services (Graduation Program). In our experiment, we recruit women to participate in a session where we elicit individual and common beliefs around gender norms before and after receiving information on gender equality. This information consists of basic facts, statistics and guidance on who to call to seek help through the use of flyers developed by Fundación Capital.  In one half of the sessions, “treatment” sessions, participants are also invited to work through IgualdApp, the digital app developed to help beneficiaries gain tools to identify and act on inequalities, discrimination and how to prevent violence against women. We test 3 IgualdApp modules out of 6: all treatment sessions receive the module on traditional gender roles, ½ of the treatment sessions also receives the module on preventing violence against women and children and the remaining ½ receives the module on sexual and reproductive health and rights. In “control” sessions, subjects only receive the basic information. Individual beliefs are measured through Likert Agreement/Disagreement responses to a set of questions formulated as norms related to the three domains, while common beliefs are measures by incentivizing these same questions.  More precisely, we adapt the Krupka and Weber (2013) method to elicit common beliefs by means of a lab coordination game, where subjects coordinate on Likert scale responses. Designed as an artefactual lab-in-the field experiment, not a randomized controlled trial, we plan to conduct 26 sessions in 13 Abrazo centres in four regions of Paraguay, with an anticipated number of participants of 10 to 15 participants per session, for an estimated total sample size of 380. In most centres, we conduct two sessions: one control and one treatment.  All treatment sessions receive the IgualdApp module on traditional gender roles.  Whether a treatment session received in addition the module on prevention of violence against women or on sexual and reproductive health and rights was determined randomly."
