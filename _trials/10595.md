abstract: "The relationship between teachers' psychological well-being and class performance is well documented observationally. However, there is scant causal evidence of the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing teachers' burnout on teachers' and students' outcomes and teacher-student relationships. This issue is pressing especially in middle schools, when relating to adolescent students is particularly challenging for teachers. By designing and evaluating a program to provide mutual support and psychological tutoring to teachers in disadvantaged schools, we aim to fill this research gap. We propose a cost-effective intervention to reduce teachers’ risk of burnout, and assess the effect of teachers’ well-being on class cohesion and students’ achievement. Our sample consists of 60 middle schools in the periphery of Naples, Italy, and it will involve 600 teachers and 3600 students. Treated teachers will meet twice a month to discuss their challenges together, supervised by a trained psychologist. We expect the intervention to (i) reduce teachers’ burnout, (ii) increase teachers’ group cohesion, (iii) improve teachers’ relationship with students and (iv) boost students’ achievements and aspirations.
