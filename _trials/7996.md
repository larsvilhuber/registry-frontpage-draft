abstract: "There has been extensive work in economics studying public good provision and charitable giving. A large body of work uses the voluntary contributions mechanism (VCM) game, in which small groups of players invest in a public good, the benefits of which are returned to the group members. Another large body of work uses the dictator game, in which players divide their budgets between themselves and a recipient, where the recipient may be another player or a charitable cause. These settings have different features – both from the view of canonical neoclassical theory as well as more modern behavioural economic theory – leading to different predictions for individual behaviour. Hence, fundamental questions arise about the generalizability of existing findings: How well do insights from public goods games extend to dictator games, and vice versa? And, how well do findings from experimental VCM and experimental dictator games translate into real-world charitable giving and public good provision? 

In this study we construct and analyse a supergame that subsumes the VCM and charitable dictator games as special cases. The supergame structure allows us to maintain comparability between disparate settings, thus allowing for a clean examination of how prosocial behaviour differs across informative subcases. Specifically, we will vary the extent to which subjects face a dictator game, a public good game, or a mix of both, and we will test for differences in average contribution behaviour across treatments. Delving deeper, we will also examine the role of participant characteristics, including charitable giving type, gender, numeracy, etc. For each of these characteristics, we will examine whether different subtypes are more or less sensitive to treatment variations.
