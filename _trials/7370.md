abstract: "Cash transfers have been consistently proven to smooth consumption and, especially when conditions are attached, encourage human capital investments in education and health care. However, the evidence on the potentially negative impacts of cash transfers on intimate partner violence (IPV) is less conclusive and varies substantially based on context, intervention parameters, and outcomes measured. Emerging evidence suggests that engaging husbands is critical to mitigating conflict within the household and engaging the broader community might also be required to enable social norm changes. Understanding what mechanisms can create sustained changes in social norms and strengthen the wellbeing of households, will allow program’s recipients, and particularly women, to better materialize the impacts of interventions such as cash transfers. This study evaluates the impact of a couples- and community-based pilot intervention in Mauritania implemented as part of a national social transfer program (Tekavoul). The couples- and community-based pilot intervention “Family Dialogue” consists of six monthly meetings for couple’s aiming at strengthening economic cooperation within the couple. In addition to this basic training, a group will receive 6 additional monthly sessions on topics such power, gender norms, gender inequalities, healthy relationships, and violence against women; and another group will be part of a community-based intervention in which short fiction films, with similar content to the additional six months of training, will be broadcasted. This study relies on a randomized controlled trial and will estimate the impact of the intervention on economic wellbeing, women’s and men’s behavior, gender norms, and domestic violence, among others."
