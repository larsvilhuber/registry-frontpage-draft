abstract: "CCT programs have become the anti-poverty program of choice in many developing countries. Numerous evaluations, often based on rigorous experimental designs, leave little doubt that such programs can increase enrollment and grades attained––in the short term. But evidence is notably lacking on whether these short-term gains translate into longer-term benefits. This project uses the randomized phase-in of the RPS CCT program in Nicaragua to estimate the long-term effects on cognitive development, educational attainment, learning, labor force participation and earnings, measured 10 years after the start of the program. The empirical analysis focuses on specific cohorts of boys and girls, for whom the program’s eligibility criteria and the randomized timing of the program imply differential exposure in early versus late treatment group.

For boys exposed to the early treatment when they were 9-12 years old. The short-term program effect of a half grade increase in schooling for boys was sustained after the end of the program and into early adulthood, and results indicate significant and substantial differential gains in both math and language achievement scores. Importantly, these coincide with positive labor market returns including higher earnings, and demonstrate important long-term returns to CCTs (study 1).

For girls in the same age cohort, CCTs not only provide incentives and means to remain in school longer, but also may affect fertility outcomes through improved nutrition (with implications for the onset of puberty) or provision of reproductive healthcare information. For the cohort of girls 9-12, differential exposure to the CCT does not lead to long-term differences in grades attained or learning, but does lead to differential impacts on the age of menarche, young adult Body Mass Index, fertility, and subsequent labor market outcomes and income (study 2).

Focusing on exposure very early in life, we also test the hypothesis that intervention starting in utero and continuing in the first two years is critical. At age ten, boys exposed to the program during this period had better cognitive, but not anthropometric, outcomes than those exposed in their second year of life or later. The lack of a differential effect on anthropometrics was due catch-up growth (study 3).
