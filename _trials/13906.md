abstract: "The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in the United States is a pivotal strategy for reducing greenhouse gas
emissions and mitigating the environmental impact of the transportation sector. To promote this shift, it is essential
to comprehend the intricate interplay between consumer preferences and political identity, as these factors
significantly influence choices regarding sustainable mobility options. This study aims to unravel the complex relationship between political identity, environmental attitudes, and the intent to purchase electric and gasoline vehicles. Grounded in moral foundation theory, the research investigates the impact of "identity" messages on participants' willingness to choose EVs over traditional gasoline-powered
vehicles. By framing the purchase decision within the context of political identity, this research explores how political beliefs intersect with consumption behaviors related to environmental sustainability. The study employs a controlled experimental design, offering participants hypothetical vehicle choices with randomized attributes. "Identity" treatments, reflecting both liberal and conservative adoption patterns of EVs, are introduced to investigate potential shifts in preferences based on triggering political identity. The research explores how price, operating costs, and range attributes, in conjunction with identity treatments, impact individuals' choices and examines whether these treatment effects vary across different segments of the population."
