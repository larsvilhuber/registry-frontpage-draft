abstract: "Work requirements are increasingly common in major public assistance programs, initially implemented in cash support (TANF) and food assistance (SNAP) programs, and recently proposed in Medicaid. Proponents of work requirements contend that these policies increase beneficiary engagement in work and community activities and may put them on a trajectory to self-sustainability. Opponents of work requirements suggest that many low-resource households will lose much-needed benefits, without commensurate improvements in employment. There is limited evidence on the causal impact of work requirements in modern public assistance programs, even as more than a dozen states have proposed new Medicaid work requirements in recent years, while other states and the federal government have expressed interest in removing work requirements from other programs. We propose a randomized-controlled trial of work requirements in Virginia, leveraging state support for exempting a portion SNAP recipients from the state’s scheduled work requirements. We will be able to separate the causal impact of work requirements from another barrier to enrollment – frequent recertification requirements – by cross-randomizing exemptions to each type of requirement. We will study impacts of both policies on program enrollment, employment, earnings, food insecurity, and health care utilization using a mix of administrative and survey-collected data. "
