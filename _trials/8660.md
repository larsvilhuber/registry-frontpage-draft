abstract: "This study aims to understand whether repetitive or correlated information on social media affects beliefs and real-life decisions. We propose a field experiment on a Chinese social platform to explore the impact of correlated posts on college students' decisions about being a civil servant. We will recruit Chinese college students and randomly assign them into two groups following different accounts operated by us. With reposting chains included in posts, we will hold constant the amount of information (content of posts, endorsement by users etc.) for both groups while varying the repetitiveness of the information.
