abstract: "The study will assess the impact of a preschool snack added to the current school meal program in Armenia. The assessment will be based on a randomized controlled trial [RCT] in three provinces with relatively high poverty levels and high rates of under 5 anemia. This will allow a causal assessment of this component of the school feeding project.   
The initial round of the RCT will focus on assessing the fluid intelligence of 0 grade students at midmorning. The same group of children (around 1200 students) will again be tested near the end of the school year (Spring 2019) to assess crystallized intelligence, that is, tests that are designed to assess school readiness."
