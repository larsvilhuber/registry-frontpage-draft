abstract: "With their extensive experience and expertise, supervisors serve as a vital resource for employee development, team cohesion, and organizational performance. However, employees may be reluctant to seek advice from their supervisors due to a significant fear of appearing incompetent and wasting their supervisors' time. Thus, it becomes important to guide employee’s advice seeking behavior to ask for advice when needed while refraining to seek advice when there is no reason to do so. 
Artificial intelligence (AI) can significantly impact advice-seeking behavior by providing non-judgmental, accessible, and efficient information. However, research shows that humans tend to over-rely on AI systems due to cognitive biases and increased levels of trust. We argue that explanations along AI forecasts – produced by explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods – can guide employees’ advice seeking behavior to seek advice even though they feel overconfident with their decision while decreasing advice seeking behavior in situations where they feel less confident.
We explore the role of XAI in influencing advice-seeking behavior to enhance productivity and facilitate decision-making. We employ an online experiment involving crowd workers to isolate the effects of different XAI methods (AI vs. Feature Importance vs. Counterfactual Explanations) on advice-seeking behavior.
