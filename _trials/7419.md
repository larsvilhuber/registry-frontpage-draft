abstract: "To evaluate the effectiveness of coping mechanisms on reducing stress when dealing with traumatic events lived in the past, we run a survey with a religious priming to Italian healthcare workers. Isolating the effects of religiosity on health presents notable empirical challenges: in some context like the US, religious people are generally wealthier, enjoy higher levels of education, and are in more stable marriages. All these characteristics are expected to positively affect individual (objective or self-assessed) physical and mental health. To overcome these empirical challenges, we ran an experiment through an online survey that was administered to healthcare workers in Italy between June 15th and August 31st, 2020, while the pressure of the first wave of the pandemic was fading away. The experiment directly manipulates the salience of individual religiosity through implicit priming. Hence, our original survey included two versions of the same 50-item questionnaire, one with a religious priming  (i.e., unscrambling statements including ``sacred'' words) and one with standard neutral questions. Participants were randomly assigned to one of these two versions through a random redirect tool compatible with the Google Forms platform, which was used to design the survey."
