abstract: "Climate change brings substantial challenges to agricultural communities, marked by rising unpredictability in water availability and weather patterns. Rural populations thereby face complex choices, like investing in irrigation or migration, often making suboptimal decisions due to climate change's complexity and cognitive loadâ€”the mental resources consumed in decision-making. This study investigates the impact of  climate change on cognitive load among rural populations in Senegal and its consequences on cognitive ability, risk preferences, adaptation and migration intentions.
