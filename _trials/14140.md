abstract: "This project proposes to examine the impact of new generative AI tools on the productivity of public sector workers. It follows in the vein of recent research examining how new generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Bard and Copilot can improve productivity across workforces and automate a variety of common tasks done by workers, freeing up their time. This study will examine whether generative AI tools hold similar promise for government workers, particularly those who work in roles that involve the development and implementation of policy. "
