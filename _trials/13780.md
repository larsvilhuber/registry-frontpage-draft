abstract: "Many educational and professional outcomes depend on performance evaluations. These evaluations might be in the form of admission or hiring decisions, or selection of an award or scholarship/grant, or even loan applications. In most settings, applicants are evaluated by either a committee or an individual with limited time to decide whether the application is above or below the bar. While the accuracy and unbiasedness of these evaluations is crucial for an efficient allocation of talent and resources, they might be affected by irrelevant factors, such as the order in which an applicant is evaluated or the time spent in each evaluation. We explore the accuracy of sequential evaluations using a large introductory economics course at a large public university. Students are assigned to grade 20 short writing assignments (SWAs) that were submitted by students from a previous semester. They use the same rubric and training that were used to grade these old SWAs. The current students are given their 20 assignments in a randomized sequential order, with randomly assigned names on each assignment, and instructed to grade them correctly. They receive points depending on the nearness of their scores to the “correct score.” Each of the old SWAs was graded blindly by multiple teaching assistants, so we use the average of the scores for each SWA as that SWA’s correct score.  This will allow us to identify the effect of the composition of the SWAs on the accuracy of grading. We will also examine whether the order in which SWAs are graded, as well as the time spent, has any impact on the accuracy of the evaluations."
