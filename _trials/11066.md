abstract: "This paper studies the role of preferences in determining how people react to information in social settings. Economists usually approach the decision to learn from others as one that is driven mainly by beliefs -- we want to learn from those who may know more than we do, and may choose not to do so if we think we are better at the task than others. While the role of preferences has been studied in the context of motivated reasoning or cognitive biases (BÃ©nabou and Tirole, 2016; Benjamin, 2019), their general role in information demand is largely unexplored. The main idea of this paper is that people may have preferences for whether to listen to others, and to whom they to listen to. I posit that individuals want to learn from those who can help them get to a better outcome (as in standard models), but the \emph{act} of learning from others may be psychologically costly and causes people to not learn when they want to/should. To test this, I run online experiments on Prolific and a panel survey sample.
