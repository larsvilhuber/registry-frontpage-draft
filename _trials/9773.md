abstract: "We conduct an information experiment with an obfuscated control to study whether information about objective life expectancy on peopleâ€™s subjective life expectancies and willingness to insure against longevity risk. The treatment provides information on the expected number of years left to live for a person of the age and gender of the respondent. We study the effects of the experiment on 1) Subjective Survival Probabilities (SSPs) to age 75 and 85, 2) Expected Claiming Ages for social security retirement benefits, 3) and preferences over a lump-sum versus an annuitized windfall ( using social security retirement as the context). Delaying Social Security claiming benefits is the most common way people can annuitize wealth, and hence one of the most important ways to insure against longevity risk.

We aim to survey 2,000 respondents, broadly representative of the US population of adults between the ages of 30 and 62, with an oversample of respondents who are over pessimistic about their expected longevity.  We will over-sample respondents whose responses to earlier surveys seem to underestimate their survival probabilities to ages 75 and 85 (that is, we will oversample respondents who are over pessimistic about their expected longevity).

Respondents will be sampled from the Understanding America Study (UAS), using responses to questions about Subjective Survival Probabilities from earlier surveys in the UAS study.
