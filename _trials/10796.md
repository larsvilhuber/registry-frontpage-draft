abstract: "This paper proposes a field experiment to study whether a perception of gender discrimination affects requested wages. People interested in an advertised position can apply using an online portal. After the initial application, participants are randomly allocated to one of two treatments. In the baseline treatment, applicants are asked to fill in a standardized curriculum vitae template, containing information about the applicant’s first name, surname, education, and employment. In a gender-blind treatment, applicants complete a curriculum vitae template in which applicants can only report their initials, so that information about gender is not transmitted.  In both treatments, applicants are asked to request the hourly wage they wish to receive if hired. 
Applicants are randomly assigned to a “hiring committee” that decides who is finally hired. The committee is composed of a predetermined number of people and have to rank a sample of candidates. Depending on the information providing by candidates, the hiring process will be either standard or gender-blind."
