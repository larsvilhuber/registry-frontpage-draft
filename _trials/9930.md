abstract: "This study tests SMS messages designed to increase completion rates among people who received a first but not second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Partnering with the Kisumu County Department of Health, four experiments were conducted to test a series of SMS- based interventions aimed at encouraging participants who had already been vaccinated for COVID-19 once to complete their vaccination regimen. The first experiment focuses on messages related to different reasons to get vaccinated. The subsequent experiments tests different deadlines to get the vaccine and obtain an airtime benefit for doing so."
