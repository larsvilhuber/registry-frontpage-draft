abstract: "We explore the role of defaults and choice architecture on student loan decision-making, experimentally testing the impact of opt-in and opt-out decision environments compared to an active choice environment. We demonstrate that the default choice presented does influence student loan borrowing decisions. Specifically, compared to active choice, students presented within an opt-in decision environment where almost five percent less likely to accept all packaged loans and borrowed 3.3 percent less in federal educational loans. These changes in borrowing did not induce substitution towards private or Parent PLUS loans nor did they negatively impact enrollment, academic performance, or on-campus work outcomes.  "
