abstract: "Political leaders and citizens alike have been criticized in the United States for sending people thoughts and prayers, especially in the wake of natural disasters and mass shootings. However, these criticisms do not account for how recipients value such intercessory gestures. We designed an experiment to elicit people’s monetary value (willingness to pay) of intercessory thoughts and prayers, in support after a recent hardship. We find Christians positively value a prayer from a Christian stranger at $4.30, and assign an even higher value ($6.80) to a prayer from a priest. By contrast, non-religious people (Atheists and Agnostics) are “prayer averse” – they are willing to pay $3.40 to avoid receiving a prayer from a Christian stranger. The value of thoughts seems affected by in-group bias over religious belonging -- Christians positively value thoughts from a Christian, but negatively value thoughts from a non-religious stranger. Non-religious people negatively value thoughts from Christians."
