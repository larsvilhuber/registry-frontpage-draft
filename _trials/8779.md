abstract: "Online review platforms, such as Glassdoor or Indeed, generally display the unweighted average of all existing reviews. However, a singular, unweighted average does not effectively capture heterogeneity in reviewer evaluations. For example, an unweighted average will typically be closer to the majority opinion due to its numeric properties. This can potentially be problematic in many labor market settings, where women systematically face different experiences than men, and are numerically the minority. In this research, we study how this unweighted aggregation affects different gendersâ€™ behaviors and labor market outcomes. We do so by designing an experiment on a job review platform geared toward high paying, high growth technology careers.  We are able to observe the gender of reviewers in our setting, and calculate separate company ratings for each gender. We compare job search behavior, as well as subsequent reviewing behavior of users who were randomly exposed to the unweighted, aggregate ratings to users who were randomly exposed to their own gender rating."
