abstract: "Many insurance policy holders inflate the size of their insured losses after events (claim-build up). Insurance companies develop sophisticated models for detecting insurance fraud and determining which insurance claims should be investigated. Based on a simple behavioral game theoretical model, we contribute to the literature by analyzing with an online experiment whether, and if so in which direction, the policy holdersâ€™ precaution measures are correlated with insurance fraud. Our model suggests that is ambiguous: People with high moral standards may invest and shy away from fraud, but policy holders who have invested may also feel more entitled to inflate their losses (see the literature on moral licensing and moral accounting).

Our experiment applies a 2x2 design with two variables: The first variable is whether the policy holder or a random computer draw decides on precaution in stage 1. We add the treatments with a random computer draw to remove self-selection into the treatments with and without moral accounting. The second variable in our 2x2 design is whether the instructions are framed in an insurance context or neutrally. In the neutral framing, we mention only amounts and probabilities, and avoid any reference to insurance. This allows us to analyze if the reference to insurance influences decisions, in particular by reducing moral concerns.
