abstract: "This study explores intrahousehold decision-making dynamics in rural Bangladesh, focusing on the coordination of risk-taking decisions between husbands and wives across different spheres of control. In these patriarchal households, men predominantly oversee market-related decisions, while women manage household-centric activities. Using an experimental investment portfolio method, we measure individual risk preferences and examine how spouses jointly determine the householdâ€™s overall risk exposure. We investigate potential inefficiencies in coordination, considering factors such as conflicting risk preferences and asymmetric frictions in intrahousehold information transfer. Findings will shed light on how households navigate decisions around saving and investing, with implications for designing gender-inclusive interventions. This research is particularly relevant for improving the efficacy of agricultural extension programs, which often overlook the role of women in household decision-making"
