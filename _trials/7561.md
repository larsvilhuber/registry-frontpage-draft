abstract: "This preregistration describes an online experiment investigating a belief-updating task with various incentive levels while removing the valence of the information feedback. We describe the experimental design, the variables of interest, the hypotheses, and sample size. The experiment is conducted online via Prolific (recruiting) and Qualtrics (study)."
