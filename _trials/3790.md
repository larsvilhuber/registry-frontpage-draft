abstract: "The theory behind the class participation and frequent tests is that procrastination is a common problem for undergraduate students (Ariely and Wertenbroch, 2002). Procrastination is not the optimal strategy, as the course material builds over the term, and the lack of comprehension of early material will cause difficulties in understanding later material. Class participation and frequent tests would induce students to put constant effort throughout the courses. In addition, learning is not a linear cumulative process. All students have a slow accumulation period. After the slow learning process (which is also called the process before inflection point), students will accelerate their learning process and students with different abilities will end up with different results. The S-shape learning curve shows that students need to put in a certain amount of effort and pass the inflection points before they discover their true levels of ability. Based on this, it is beneficial to induce all students to put early efforts into their courses: they will not be left behind, and they will find out their academic potential. Few studies test whether we should induce early efforts in studentsâ€™ courses."
