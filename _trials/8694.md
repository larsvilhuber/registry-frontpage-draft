abstract: "The main research objective is to test empirically the concept of “fair innings”, as introduced in Adler et al. (2021). This paper provides a rigorous basis in economic theory for the “fair innings” concept, proposed in the public health literature: as between an older individual and a similarly situated younger individual (one with the same income and risk profile), a risk reduction for the younger individual is accorded greater social weight even if the gains to expected lifetime utility are equal.
