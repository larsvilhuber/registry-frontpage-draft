abstract: "We conduct an online survey experiment in Germany to analyze how individuals' support for climate policy varies with certain characteristics of its implementation and with individuals' personal characteristics. In addition, we also want to explore how support for climate policy is affected by a pessimistic economic outlook. To this end, we conduct a conjoint experiment in the context of a randomised online survey experiment. "
