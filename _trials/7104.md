abstract: "The role of continuing care through pregnancy may yield important health effects on birth-related outcomes. This study will investigate the effect of enhancing primary care clinics with midwives on outcomes related to prenatal, natal, and postnatal care. We implement a randomized phased-in of assignment of midwives to primary care centers in municipalities in Bolivia. This is done in the context of a government project to improve the public health network of the country by investing in primary care, hospitals, infrastructure, human resources, and IT systems.  We will use administrative records and surveys to gather information on final outcomes."
