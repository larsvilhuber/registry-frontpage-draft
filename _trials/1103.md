abstract: "We are currently running a randomised field experiment involving Local Support Organisations (LSOs) across Pakistan. We have completed the baseline, and the treatment (i.e. the implementation of protocols for reporting and for non-financial rewards) is ongoing. The LSOs have just completed sending the first self-reported data through that treatment, and at the time of registration of this document we have not accessed that data. This pre-analysis plan sets out the main regressions that we intend to run."
