abstract: "Foreign currency usage is very common in some economies in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe, where especially the euro is used next to local currencies. In this project, I conceptualize the joint decision in which currency to save and in which to borrow: in local or foreign currency. I coin this decision currency co-holding. Using an international survey, I look at which co-holding combinations are common among which socio-demographic groups, i.e. to which individual characteristics they are correlated to. I am especially interested in the role of trust, risk tolerance and financial literacy, in particular the knowledge about potential risks stemming from foreign currency loans (FX-literacy). First data for the project were already collected in the 2022 wave of the survey. To uncover a potential causal channel from FX-literacy to currency co-holding preferences, I additionally conduct an information experiment in the current wave of the survey, which is in field in fall 2024.

The experiment intends to vary the knowledge about exchange rates and the potential risks arising from an exchange rate depreciation. After answering several financial literacy questions, including one on exchange rate literacy, survey participants are randomized into either getting further information on exchange rates or not. Subsequently, they are asked whether they would prefer to deposit money in local or foreign currency and in which currency they would prefer to borrow. In addition, they are asked about potential motives to borrow in a certain currency, depending on the choice they have made before."
