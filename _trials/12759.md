abstract: "Background:
Dementia and depression are highly prevalent and interconnected conditions among adults and are associated with individualsâ€™ distress and rising mental health conditions in Pakistan. Effective, saleable and feasible interventions are needed. Music based interventions have shown promising effects, but the current evidence base is inconclusive. The present study aimed to determine the effectiveness of different music interventions on the depressive symptoms of people with dementia and depression.
Method:
This study used a simple random sampling technique, randomized controlled trial. Thirty participants will be recruited from psychiatric departments in Rawalpindi. They will be equally divided into two groups: control group and experimental group. In controlled group (15 participants) the data will be collected from normal population and in experimental group (15 participants) the data will be collected from dementia patients having comorbid symptoms of depression. To assess the intervention four block designed will be created in which participants will experience positive and negative music-visual induction on Psychopy. The study employed a two-way factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) to evaluate the effectiveness of music intervention in reducing symptoms, improving cognitive insight and enhancing quality of life.
