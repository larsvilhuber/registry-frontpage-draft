abstract: "Over the past two decades, Morocco’s growth has been accompanied by low job creation, and labor market conditions remained characterized by persistent unemployment, low job quality, and exclusion of certain groups such as the youth and women. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these challenges. Given this context, it is critical to better understand how public employment services (PES) can help stimulate job creation, create longer-lasting job matches and increase access to job opportunities for all. In this study, we partner with the Moroccan Public Employment Agency – l'Agence Nationale de Promotion de l'Emploi et des Compétences, (Anapec) – to assess the impact of offering hiring support to firms on a number of relevant labor market indicators. In particular, we are evaluating an intervention that aims to alleviate some of the information frictions firms face in accessing PES services and to determine whether a higher take-up of three types of services  – wage subsidy, training subsidy, and screening services – can boost labor demand. We plan to rely on administrative and survey data to measure whether the treatment helps stimulate labor demand and increase job creation. We also use this data to explore mechanisms through the types of PES services that are used and the quality of the newly created vacancies. "
