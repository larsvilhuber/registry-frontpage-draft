abstract: "Sustained progress on child mortality requires better acute care. We study how subsidies and healthworkers providing symptom information affect healthcare over- and underuse, which depend not just on overall demand, but on whether children receive care when actually sick. In an RCT of 1768 children in Mali we collect nine weeks of daily symptom and healthcare data to measure demand conditional on need for care, as defined by WHO standards. Subsidies substantially increase care when it is medically indicated, while overuse remains rare. Healthworker visits have no aggregate effects, but may improve use of the subsidy for the youngest children."
