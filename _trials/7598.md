abstract: "We investigate experimentally how a forecaster’s acknowledgement of uncertainty affects the reader’s ambiguity attitudes in a task that is characterized by a high degree of uncertainty. To this end, we expose a representative survey sample to historical temperatures and indirectly ask them to make a forecast using Baillon et al’s  (2018) method. Subsequently, we introduce them to a real expert’s temperature forecast and repeat Baillon’s tasks. The weather forecast is manipulated exogenously in a 2x3 between-subject design and differs with respect to the communication strategies: The forecast contains either a point estimator, an asymmetric interval estimator, or both. In addition, we vary the forecasts’ moment of surprise as one set of forecasts (literally) is in line with the historical temperatures, while the other set is not. Baillon et al.’s elicitation method yields two ambiguity measures per respondent, both pre and post treatment. This allows us to make inferences about the impact of communication strategies and their interaction with conflict aversion arising from the (lack of) surprise on ambiguity attitudes."
