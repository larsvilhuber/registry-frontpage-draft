abstract: "This study evaluates the effect of Saudi Arabiaâ€™s unemployment insurance (UI) program (Hafiz) on labor market outcomes. We first use administrative data to analyze how behavior changes before and after the 12-month unemployment insurance. To better understand the effect of providing information to Hafiz beneficiaries, we then implement three experiments. The first experiment, (1) Q5 Employment Bonus, presents treated individuals with information about the Qarar 5 (Q5) employment bonus program. The Q5 program was designed to reward early exist from Hafiz, by structuring employment bonus amounts to increase with the number of remaining UI payments. The second experiment, (2) Employment Trends, first asks respondents to estimate the share of women in different economic sectors of the country and then presents the actual percentage. Finally, the third experiment, (3) Employer Demand for Women, asks respondents to estimate the share of women that receive interview requests from certain employment sectors, and then presents the actual shares."
