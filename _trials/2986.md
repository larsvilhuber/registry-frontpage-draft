abstract: "Recent large-scale randomized field experiments have shown that simple and scalable planning interventions -- asking people when and where they plan to act -- can help people follow through on behaviors they intend to pursue in a broad range of settings. 
The purpose of this study is to test whether similar planning interventions can increase the frequency of gym visits made by members of a fitness facility."
