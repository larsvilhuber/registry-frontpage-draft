abstract: "The quality of the teaching force is the key factor explaining the success of educational systems. In a previopus trial we built up a collection of the best available tips to improve teacher relational skills, looking for them through international and national literature review and in depth interviews. More precisely, we producing a booklet facing six issues that teachers are called to face related to their relational skills. Each issue is treated not only in the booklet, but also with a very short video. 
In November 2018, we offered these tips to teachers in a sample of 204 recently hired teachers in a permanent position ("neoassunti") in the province of Trento.
Teacher have been randomized to immediate treatment (102) or delayed treatmet (102), blocking the randomization on school level (primary. lower secondary and upper secondary) and quartiles of self-efficacy measured before the intervention.
The RCT is designed in order to test the impact of our booklet in the short run, at the end of the first school year (CAWI interviews) on several outcomes on teachers:
- self-efficacy (primary outcome);
- collaboration with colleagues (secondary outcome);
- anxiety (secondary outcome);
- satisfaction about relations with colleagues, students and thier parents (secondary outcome);
- integration in the school community (secondary outcome).
We collect also data on reported practices suggested in the booklet (manipulation check).
Follow up data will be collected in the following weeks (June 19th until the middle of July).
