abstract: "SDG6 sets out the challenge of ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. However, access to safe drinking water remains limited. Designing policies to improve access to safe drinking water is difficult, given uncertainty over the relative importance of different sources of contamination of drinking water: source contamination and recontamination through transport or storage. 

This study uses an extensive water testing program to evaluate the effect of an intervention to provide new, safe sources of drinking water on household water quality. The intervention consists of a package of subsidies and technical advice. We estimate: (i) the effect of the intervention on household water quality; (ii) the effect of the intervention on behavior with respect to obtaining and storing water for drinking and cooking; (iii) the causal effects of water source quality and distance to safe drinking water on household water quality.

Our evaluation design has two key features. First, we exploit random assignment of the safe drinking water intervention to 129 out of a total of 171 study communities. However, each community decides where to install new sources of safe drinking water. The location of new sources may therefore be correlated with other characteristics that also predict changes in behavior with respect to use of safe drinking water. To estimate the causal effect of water source quality and distance to safe drinking water on household water quality, we implement a two-stage procedure. First, we use detailed baseline data to predict where communities choose to install new water sources. We then combine these predicted locations with other baseline characteristics of households to predict changes in behavior. Comparing households with the same baseline characteristics in control and treated villages allows us to recover the causal effects of interest. "
