abstract: "There exists a bias towards government jobs both from within families as well as from the society, which often pushes Indian youths towards excessively high aspirations, irrational expectations about the job market and longer spells of unemployment. This strong desire and bias towards government jobs, unrealistic family expectations, and societal pressure can have serious consequences on the well-being of the young adults, those around them (family members) and the society in general. This study will first attempt to understand the complex factors contributing to the problem. In addition, to combat these challenges, the current project outlines a comprehensive approach involving mental health counselling, information dissemination with focus on expectations correction, effective learning and finally parental counselling. The proposal envisions working with about 2,300 youths (both male and female) in the 20-29 age group from 150 different regions (urban as well as rural) in the district of Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh. The experimental design will include three treatment groups receiving varying levels of intervention and a control group. "
