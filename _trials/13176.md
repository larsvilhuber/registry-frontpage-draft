abstract: "We study how team production responds to the alignment of performance targets and incentives. We design a lab experiment in which teams of two players have to complete a real-effort task and can check the progress of their partner in real time ("Team" condition). We consider a set of treatments in which individuals are subject to both piece-rate incentives and to either individual or group-level targets. Our objective is to measure how alternative target and punishment schemes affect team effort, as measured by the experimental task. "
