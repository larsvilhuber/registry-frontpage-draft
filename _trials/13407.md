abstract: "This experiment aims to understand the causal effects of corporate transparency and accounting (CTA) practices on the growth and access to finance of medium-sized firms in Uganda. We provide consulting to companies in a randomized controlled trial setting. For each treated firm, we assign a financial consultant to introduce digital accounting software and adopt best accounting and financial reporting practices. We evaluate the causal impact of this intervention on both CTA practices and various firm-level outcomes, such as access to finance and firm performance.
