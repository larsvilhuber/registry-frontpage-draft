abstract: "Recent experimental research shows that responsibility attribution can be shifted by delegating to a third party. Existing studies focus on the change in punishment patterns for the delegation of unkind decisions. There are not enough observations for the delegation of kind decisions, and little evidence of such responsibility shifting pattern for kind delegation. We run an online experiment with a delegated dictator game, and examine the reward patterns of the recipients for the fair option. This connects with the existing evidence and helps provide a general picture of responsibility attribution in delegation."
