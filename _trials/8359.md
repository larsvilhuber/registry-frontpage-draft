abstract: "In this study, we investigate the effect of managerial attention on employees’ engagement and psychological safety. The literature has shown that psychological safety is an important driver of a team’s healthy dynamics and performance. However less is knows on what interventions can increase psychological safety and why. We use a field setup in collaboration with a large firm; we nudge managers to increase psychological safety of their team members in one-to-one meetings. By introducing exogenous variation in the treatment, we aim to disentangle two underlying mechanisms: individual feeling of belonging to the team and the existence of team obstacles or constraints. "
