abstract: "Federal rental assistance programs are one of the largest and most effective anti-poverty programs in the US, lifting over three million people out of poverty every year. The largest rental assistance program, the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program, has been found to dramatically reduce homelessness and housing instability, and facilitate geographic and economic mobility. But its success depends crucially on participation from landlords, which determines both how many units are available to voucher holders and where these units are located. In a randomized experiment conducted in partnership with the Public Housing Authority (PHA) in a mid-sized US city, we will test the impact of targeted outreach on property owners’ interest in participating in the city’s HCV program.
