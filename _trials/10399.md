abstract: "Despite considerable improvements in female labor market participation in the last decades, having children still has sizeable negative effects on mothers' labor supply and earnings. The gender gap in earnings due to parenthood is particularly striking in Switzerland: six years after having their first child, women's earnings are 75% lower compared to those of men. This means that upon entrance into parenthood, women, on average, forego a large proportion of their potential lifetime income. Among other things, this results in women systematically saving less for retirement than men.  

This study aims to better understand why women decide to reduce their workload upon becoming mothers. We hypothesize that they do not fully factor in the longer-term financial costs of low or no labor force participation. To test this, we will conduct a field experiment among female teachers with children in Switzerland where we randomly inform women about the future long-term financial consequences of having a reduced workload. The treatment consists of an informational video discussing the long-term financial consequences for an example case and a tool that allows users to visualize the long-term financial implications of different workload scenarios for their individual case. We compare this treatment to a control group that receives videos with unrelated information.

We will analyze the impact of this intervention on women's financial awareness and behaviors, desired labor supply, and actual labor supply.
