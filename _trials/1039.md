abstract: "This study evaluates the effects of the Nurse Family Partnership (NFP), an established home-visiting program, using a scientifically rigorous individual-level randomized controlled trial. The study will be based in South Carolina, where a Medicaid waiver in combination with a pay-for-success contract will allow expansion of the program to women on Medicaid.  The study plans to enroll 4000 low-income, first time mothers and their children into the intervention group, and another 2000 into the control group. Using data from administrative records, researchers will evaluate the average impact of NFP on pre-term birth, birth spacing, child injury, as well as the long-term health, education, and economic self-sufficiency of the family. From 1978 to 1994, three modest-scale randomized evaluations had suggested that NFP had a positive impact on birth outcomes, maternal and child health, and  other measures of social and economic well-being of mothers and their children.  This study aims to yield new evidence on the effect of NFP in a modern context, applied to a new population, across a broad range of outcomes, and financed by a novel public-private partnership based on accountability for outcomes.
