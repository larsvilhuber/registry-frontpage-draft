abstract: "The 172 boys who participated in this study were a subsample of the Montreal Longitudinal and Experimental Study. In the spring of 1984, 1037 boys attending the last year of kindergarten (mean age: 6.1 years) were recruited from schools in low socioeconomic neighbourhoods of Montreal (Quebec, Canada). Gender (boys), ethnicity (White) and socioeconomic status were homogeneous as a result of the selection procedure. This study was approved by the University of Montreal Institutional Review Board, with participation in the study requiring both parental consent and child assent. From the original sample, those who received scores above the seventieth percentile on the teacher-rated disruptiveness scale (n = 250) of the Pre-school Behavior Questionnaire (PBQ) in kindergarten were classified as disruptive and designated as at-risk for conduct disorder. These boys were then randomly assigned according to a 1:1:2 randomisation scheme to one of three groups (intervention group, n= 69; no-treatment control group, n= 60; and intensive observation group, n = 121) by drawing the names from a box until the necessary numbers were obtained. Of these, 23, 18 and 37 parents from each of these groups, respectively, refused to take any further part in the study. Thus, of the 172 participants included for analysis in the current study, 46 boys and their parents took part in the intervention, 42 were assigned as controls and 84 were assigned to an intensive observation group. Boys included in analyses did not differ significantly from those who refused to participate on any of the variables implemented in this study. The intervention was implemented over 2 school years, from September 1985 to June 1987, when boys were 7–9 years of age. The first component of the intervention, social and problem-solving skills training, aimed to promote healthy peer relations. It also aimed to promote self-control and consequently reduce impulsivity and antisocial behaviour. Boys took part in training sessions at their school in small groups of four to seven children. These groups of children generally had a ratio of three to four prosocial children to one disruptive child, with a ratio of five to two in groups of seven. The sessions were conducted by four trained professionals (one psychologist, one social worker and two psychoeducators), lasted about 45 minutes each, and included verbal instructions, positive reinforcement, behaviour modelling and rehearsal. The professionals who delivered the training sessions for the boys also offered to meet twice with each teacher to monitor the child’s progress in the classroom and help the teacher set up reinforcement contingencies to support practice of the learnt skills in the classroom. However, this was implemented in only half of the classrooms with a target child because half of the teachers refused to participate in this part of the programme. The second component, training sessions for parents, was based on the Oregon Social Learning Center Model. Those sessions were conducted at the parents’ homes by a different professional from the one who worked with the children. It included teaching parents to recognise problematic and appropriate behaviours of their boys, to set clear objectives for them and reinforce appropriate behaviours. Parents were also encouraged to supervise their children’s schoolwork and behaviour outside the home. Detailed longitudinal data from these cohorts was collected on the boys’ socio-emotional development during childhood and adolescence and later adult outcomes. In partnership with Statistics Canada, we matched this longitudinal data to data from tax returns from ages 20-37 years."
