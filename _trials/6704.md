abstract: "The previous literature has brought consistent evidence that many Disability Insurance (DI) beneficiaries retain a considerable capacity to work. There exists a dedicated program in Belgium that allows those DI recipients to return to work on a part-time basis and keep a share of their benefits. Participation remains, however, relatively low with only 11% of long-term DI recipients. Among the reasons for low participation, our discussions with stakeholders have highlighted the lack of accessible information about the program rules and incentives. With that in mind, we designed a low-cost informational intervention in collaboration with the Belgian National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance (NIHDI). A nudge was added to an existing communication addressed to all beneficiaries upon their entry to long-term disability (i.e. after 12 months on DI). We modified the content and appearance of NIHDI mailing to include information about the return-to-work program in a dedicated colored box to attract the attention of the reader. We highlighted the potential financial gains and stressed the action-relevant information. A second version of the nudge also tests the added value of referring the recipient to a dedicated website to perform a personalized simulation of the financial gains depending on the expected wage and preferred workload."
