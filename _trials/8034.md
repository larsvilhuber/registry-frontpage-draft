abstract: "We plan to analyze the first year of a nationwide randomized-controlled trial of end stage renal disease (ESRD) treatment choice. This mandatory-participation program was designed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and randomization was conducted at the hospital referral region (HRR) level. 95 HRRs were assigned to the treatment group beginning in January 2021. We will study the impact of this program in the first year on treatment modality choice for ESRD and explore heterogeneity in impact across patients and providers."
