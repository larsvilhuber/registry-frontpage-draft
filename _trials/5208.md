abstract: "We estimate the effects of school-based management (SBM) on schooling, health, social capital formation, financial inclusion, and community participation in Burkina Faso. We conduct household, student, and school panel surveys in Ganzourgou Province. Also, we undertake a large-scale RCT of SBM combined with lab-in-the-field experiments (i.e., incentivized public goods game and hypothetical dictator game) to measure social capital and other-regarding preferences.
