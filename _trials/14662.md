abstract: "This experiment evaluates the effects of two complementary interventions designed to provide role models to low-SES students. These interventions focus on students enrolled in 10th grade in Chile. The sample consists of 320 schools. To evaluate the interventions, high schools were randomly assigned (at the school level) into two groups: a pure control group and a web-based role model curriculum treatment group. Top-math female students of the web-based treatment schools were randomly assigned to a personal role-model treatment. This originates three arms of the main experiment: a pure control group, a group of students who are exposed to role models only through a web-based curriculum, and a group of students who are exposed to role models through the web-based curriculum and through personal interaction.

To study the underlying mechanisms of the role model effect, I randomized the gender of role models in the web-based curriculums to test if there is any heterogeneity of the treatment effect due to gender match between the role model and the student. The intervention design includes features that allow us to study the effect of female and male role models in girls and boys. With this feature of the experiment, I aim to understand to what extent having a male or female role model differentially affects boys and girls. This pre-analysis plan provides some background information on the intervention, outlines the study design, and describes the inference and estimation procedures."
