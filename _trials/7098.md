abstract: "On many issues, such as the safety of vaccines or human-caused climate change, a substantial minority of the public rejects the scientific consensus. Why are individuals willing to reject the opinions of much better-informed experts on these issues? One possibility is that individuals distrust the objectivity of scientists. Scientists are people, and their opinions – particularly those relevant to policy – are shaped not only by evidence, but also by prior beliefs, values, and incentives. Given the dominance of white men and liberals in science (e.g. Nelson and Rogers, 2005; Gross and Simmons, 2007), the public may reasonably infer that scientists are not evaluating the evidence according to the same values that they hold. If this is the case, then increasing diversity in science communication should improve public trust - both by increasing the probability that there is a "match" between the scientist communicating results and the participant, and by showing that people with a wide range of values hold similar opinions. In this trial, we attempt to directly test this hypothesis by showing people communications about the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine from scientists who randomly differ in their demographics or political/religious orientation. We examine both the effect of "matching" the participant, and of diversity more generally, by assigning participants to one of four treatment conditions: one where they see statements from two scientists who are different from the participant but similar to each other (no match, no diversity), one where they see a statement from two scientists who "match" them on demographics or political/religious orientation (match, no diversity), one where they see two statements from scientists who are different from the participant and from each other (no match but diversity), and one where they see statements from one scientist who matches them and one who does not (match and diversity). We will examine the impact of these statements on  trust in science, intent to get the COVID vaccine, and eventual uptake of the vaccine."
