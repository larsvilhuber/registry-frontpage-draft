abstract: "Many people feel powerless to do reduce climate change as the individual choices they can make are likely to only have negligible impact. If their choices were to influence many others, however, then collectively the impact would become more important. We will study how peopleâ€™s decision to mitigate their climate impact depends on the possibility to have social influence. In a baseline treatment participants decide by how much to mitigate their climate impact by donating to a tree planting scheme. Additional treatments then allow for their decision to be observed by a number of others either before or after they make their choice. When others observe a decision before they make their choice this creates the possibility of social influence in the experiment. "
