abstract: "In seventy-one percent of societies worldwide, women move to the area where her husband and his kin live at the time of marriage (Murdock 1967). I seek to evaluate how womenâ€™s ability to enter social networks after moving to a new village for marriage affects their mental health and integration into social and financial networks in rural Malawi villages. While a growing literature shows mental health disorders and loneliness are highly prevalent among low-income people, including within developing countries (Banerjee et al. 2023), there is limited evidence documenting causal pathways and mitigating strategies in this population. Furthermore, although evidence documents that social networks facilitate financial risk-sharing and information transmission (Breza et al. 2019), little is known about how social networks originate or evolve. My intervention will help young, low-income female marriage migrants to initiate meal-sharing with other women, a common way to engage socially. My study design will allow me to understand the causes and consequences of sparse and homophilic networks within a socially isolated and vulnerable population. I will explore the roles of social frictions and budget constraints as potential inhibitors of homophilic and non-homophilic network formation among young female marriage migrants. Finally, I will investigate how encouraging meal-sharing relationship affects social network formation and characteristics, psychological well-being, and socio-economic inclusion."
