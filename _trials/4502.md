abstract: "Businesses in low-income countries tend to be small and typically have little prospects for growth. Our study centers around an entrepreneurship training for university students implemented by StartHub Africa that sets out to foster the creation of high-potential enterprises. We will study selection into participation in the entrepreneurship training, in particular the role of preferences, beliefs, personality traits, and cognitive ability, and the short- and medium-term impacts of the entrepreneurship training on business creation, performance, and jobs creation, as well as labor market outcomes. Our identification strategy relies on randomized marketing message and data collection from representative populations of potential applicants to address selection question, and an oversubscription design and a random assignment of applicants to participate in the entrepreneurship training for the main evaluation of the entrepreneurship training.
