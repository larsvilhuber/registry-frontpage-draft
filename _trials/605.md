abstract: "Risk sharing, in which individuals and households make both monetary and non-monetary transfers to each other, is an important mechanism through which households can cope with idiosyncratic risk in settings with little or no access to insurance. Moral hazard, in which individuals cannot observe the actions of others, may exist in these settings and limit the potential for risk sharing. The purpose of my research project is to investigate the extent to which moral hazard limits risk sharing and whether social proximity can help overcome the problems of the moral hazard. I use a laboratory experiment in Nairobi, Kenya with residents of the Kibera slum to address these questions."
