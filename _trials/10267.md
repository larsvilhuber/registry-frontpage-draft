abstract: "This study evaluates the impact of a mobile app designed to reduce frictions in agricultural output markets in the context of a government-led home-grown school feeding program in Guatemala. To prepare school meals, schools make purchase orders of ingredients using the app which are then shared for local farmers to make competitive offers. In coordination with the government and World Food Programme, we conduct a municipality-level random assignment where 30 municipalities are introduced to the mobile app (‘’treatment group”) and 29 municipalities are not (“control group”). The study leverages administrative data, high frequency phone survey, and in-person endline surveys to measure the impacts of introducing the mobile app on take-up, readiness, and procurement behaviors (e.g. adherence to the government-proposed menus, procurement efficiency, quantity and prices of food by types of sellers).
