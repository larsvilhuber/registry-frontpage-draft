abstract: "This is the analysis plan for a laboratory experiment conducted at the University of California San Diego. In the experiment which will be described in detail below, potential senders make a promise about how much they will give to the receiver in a dictator game. Based on the promises a receiver can select one of two potential senders to play the dictator game with. We investigate whether promises allow a selection of better senders and whether competition in promising leads senders to give more than they do in a regular dictator game controlling for any positive selection. 
Firstly, we predict that different sender types do not separate by their promise such that no selection of better senders is possible. In addition, we expect most senders the same or a very similar promise, the modal promise to be equal or higher than the amount that gives both senders and receivers an equal amount. 
Secondly, we predict that senders give away more in the promise than the dictator game, both for all participants and when restricting the analysis to those participants that are selected as senders.
