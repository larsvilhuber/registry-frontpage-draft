abstract: "In this study we investigate the interaction of firms’ price and wage setting behaviour and their inflation expectations. In particular, we study how inflation expectations are passed through into prices and wages. While theoretically there is a broad consensus about the relevance of the price setting of firms for inflation as well as economic activity, we know relatively little about how and to what extent firms build their inflation expectations into their prices and wages. We analyse these questions using a new firm-level survey with an RCT design that we conduct in Switzerland. Switzerland provides an ideal setting as it has a history of low and stable inflation and a flexible labor market with a low degree of wage indexation. Besides eliciting firm specific variables, and expectations about prices and wages we provide firms with information treatments and scenarios. Treatments are used to either allude to current price changes or to the history of stable prices in Switzerland. We hope that we will be able to provide new insights on the role of perceptions and expectations for firms’ decision making. "
