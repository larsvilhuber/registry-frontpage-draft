abstract: "We investigate the impacts of providing asset transfers and business training to poor individuals in Chile, and ask whether a larger asset transfer magnifies the program impact. We randomly assigned a large-scale, publicly run micro-entrepreneurship program and evaluate its effects over 45 months. Exposure to the program raised asset accumulation, business practices, employment and labor income. The asset transfer level affected the type of employment in the long run: individuals assigned to a smaller transfer are more likely to be wage-workers, whereas those assigned to larger transfers tend to be self-employed. Our results demonstrate that access to training and assets improves business outcomes, and that the level of transfer matters. It also shows that wage-work is a significant opportunity cost in a middle income country such as Chile."
