abstract: "This project is a large-scale field experiment in Zambia, which uses a multi-armed text-messaging intervention with ~80,000 households to: 1) identify the behavioral barriers that lead to low engagement with formal financial services amongst those using the services; and 2) test strategies to help people overcome those barriers to increase engagement and financial security. The experiment will provide some of the first evidence on the impact of conversational, two-way text messaging designed to encourage savings and improve loan repayment behaviors through Q&A capabilities and efforts to enhance trust in formal financial products."
