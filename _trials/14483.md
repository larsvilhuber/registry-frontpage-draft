abstract: "We aim to test the effectiveness of large language models (LLM) in producing “newsletter creative” (NC) compared to human writers. We collaborate with Wine Access (WA), an online wine retailer, to run a randomized controlled experiment (RCT) in a 20-day period so respondents will get/not get NC generated from different sources:
1. Test 1 (size = 9,000): The respondent receives daily WA newsletters created by the human writer team.
2. Test 2 (size = 9,000): The respondent receives daily WA newsletters created by the LLM.
3. Test 3 (size = 9,000): The respondent receives daily WA newsletters created by the human marketing team with access to and can tune the LLM.
At the start of the experiment, each subject will be randomly assigned to one of the experimental cells above and will remain in that cell throughout the 20-day duration of the experiment. Each cell will have a human fact-checker that’s independent of the human writer team so the newsletter has accurate information. The effectiveness of NC can be assessed based on comparisons of multiple outcome variables such as site visits, revenues, and profits. "
