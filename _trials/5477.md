abstract: "Arsenic-contaminated groundwater is consumed by approximately 100 million people worldwide and has severe health consequences. Using an RCT conducted in Bihar, India, we test the effectiveness of an information-based intervention, focused on spreading awareness about arsenic in the groundwater and mitigation techniques. We use this context to study how social norms and beliefs affect how people act on new information about safe water use. Despite the importance of the role of social norms and beliefs in influencing behavior, there has been little research using them to understand information interventions better. We aim to be one of the firsts in connecting these two lines of research. "
