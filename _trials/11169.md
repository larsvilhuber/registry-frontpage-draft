abstract: "The study provides a methodological contribution to the circumstances under which personality tests can be used effectively in the context of supporting entrepreneurs in developing countries. It tests whether personality tests are valid in these contexts and assesses the degree to which individuals are able and willing to “fake” their personality test results. Furthermore, the study tests whether gender differences in honesty and stereotype threat affect outcomes of otherwise equally qualified individuals and evaluates the extent to which the use of high cognitive load can reduce “faking” and any gender-based disadvantage in the use of personality tests."
