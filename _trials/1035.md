abstract: "This project seeks to improve maternal health, birth outcomes and early child development, by empowering mothers through a SMS information system. The SMS information system is targeted at beneficiaries of Prospera, Mexicoâ€™s conditional cash transfer programme (formerly known as Progresa and Oportunidades). The SMS information system consists of appointment reminders, prompts to plan for birth and emergencies, information on potential concerns, and preventative health care advice. SMS are sent in a personalized manner using administrative information, medical records and the responses from the beneficiaries to SMS. The two-way system also allows beneficiaries to seek emergency care, report health concerns and change their regular appointments.
Three treatments variations will be evaluated with a randomized control trial (RCT) design. The first treatment arm will test the impact of the two-way information system. The second variation will test the SMS system with additional messages from local community members. Finally, the third group will test the SMS system with the additional component of enabling beneficiaries to provide feedback on the health services received. The feedback collected on the quality of the clinic services will be later used to provide incentives to clinic personnel.
Rigorous evidence about potential changes in habits, knowledge, health service demand, anthropometrics and developmental outcomes will be explored.
