abstract: "In this randomized evaluation, we study the effects of a teacher training intervention that aims to improve well-being and teaching practices amongst teachers in Jordan's public schools. We implement a cluster-randomised design, with schools being the unit of randomization and teachers being the unit of observation. In the treatment group, teachers will complete various modules over a 3 month-long period. Outcomes will be measured via self-administered surveys (well-being measures) and classroom observations (teaching practices).
