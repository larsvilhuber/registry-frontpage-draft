abstract: "This research project aims to investigate experimentally the dynamic interaction between human creative skills and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). We focus on understanding whether the interaction between AI and human creative skills either complement each other, thereby enhancing the quality of creative outputs, or if it poses a risk to originality and the overall quality of creative outputs. Central to our study is the elicitation of information to help us understand the AI’s marginal contribution to the quality of on an individual’s written text, measured by originality, grammatical accuracy, and engagement with a question."
