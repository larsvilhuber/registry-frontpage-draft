abstract: "The study aims to test whether a behavioral change communication on nutrition and women’s empowerment improves nutrition and gender equality indicators in an irrigation catchment area in Myanmar. This study will provide insights on how to enhance nutrition and gender impacts of agricultural and irrigation projects, particularly the Myanmar Agricultural Development Support Project (ADSP). The intervention is a behavioral change communication on nutrition and gender equality consisting of bimonthly engagements with target households (alternating group-level meetings and household-level and individual coaching). This will be implemented by selected community facilitators trained on gender transformative approaches from local gender partner (MIGS) and on the locally-developed nutrition training module by The Save the Children (LEARN). The actual content of the BCC materials is adjusted based on the gaps and constraints identified in the baseline survey implemented by IFPRI, World Bank and from December 2019  to January 2020. The trial started in May 2019, with the start of the baseline survey. The intervention is targeted to start in March 2020, and end on April 2021.
