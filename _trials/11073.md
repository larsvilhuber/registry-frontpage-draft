abstract: "We evaluate the long-term impacts of an in-kind transfer, a bicycle, received by students in rural Zambia in 2017, on girls’ realised empowerment. We assess how the receipt of a bicycle affects school dropout, teenage pregnancies, early marriages, and gender-based violence. Using the random allocation of schools to receive bicycles in 2017 or not, we surveyed girls that were enrolled back then in the schools of the experiment."
