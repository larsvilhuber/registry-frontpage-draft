abstract: "We plan to conduct an online experiment on improving heat related-illness prevention behaviors and knowledge for the elderly in order to verify whether a daily survey on the behaviors and/or economic incentive will have any impact on the effective prevention. Individual participants (aged 65 and over) will be randomly assigned to one of 3 intervention groups. Each subject participates in a 28 consecutive experimental session. The first group will be assigned every day to an online survey on whether he or she took heat related-illness prevention behaviors last night. The second one will be assigned the same survey and be paid monetary incentive based on the number of days in which he or she used an air-conditioner at hot night. The last one will be the control group without the survey or economic incentive."
