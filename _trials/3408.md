abstract: "Evidence on the effectiveness of Community-Led Total Sanitation programs (CLTS) and latrine subsidies in promoting hygiene practices has been documented in a number of studies, reviewed in Garn et al. (2016). Less is known about how collective and individual financial incentives can interact to improve sanitation for the poorest households. We investigate this question in two provinces of South Laos, where over half of our sample of 2,400 households practiced open defecation at the beginning of our study. We conduct a randomized controlled trial encompassing 160 villages. All households were exposed to CLTS. In treatment groups, we augmented CLTS with packages of financial incentives to test their impacts on hygiene. We are interested in how the incentives promote hygienic behavior across the wealth distribution. This study will provide evidence on the complementarity of small financial incentives to demand-triggering campaigns and their role in promoting equity in areas where sanitation coverage remains low."
