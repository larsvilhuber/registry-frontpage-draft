abstract: "This project studies barriers to the adoption of biogas digesters in rural Egypt. In particular, we want to understand whether information and credit constraints are barriers preventing the take-up of biogas technology among rural agricultural households. The project combines qualitative work and focus group interviews with a large survey and survey experiment. We conduct a representative survey with 1,000 agricultural households in the Nile Delta region of Egypt. Of these households, 100 will be sampled conditional on already having a biogas digester, while the remaining 900 will not. For the 900 households without a biogas unit, we will study barriers to biogas take-up with a survey experiment. We experimentally allocate the 900 households without biogas digesters to different treatment arms, aiming at understanding informational and financial barriers to take-up."
