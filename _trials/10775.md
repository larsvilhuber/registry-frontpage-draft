abstract: "An abundance of statistics has shown the gender disparity in corporate organizations, political bodies, and university positions. These facts lead to a natural question: why arenâ€™t women being hired or promoted in the workplace? This project examines the role decision-making bodies play in gender disparity in hiring using a laboratory experiment.

Our first research question asks: how does the gender composition of a hiring committee affect who gets hired? Additionally, the process by which hiring decisions are made likely plays an important role in affecting who gets hired. For example, are decisions made democratically with all members having an equal voice? Or are decisions made unilaterally by a leader? Therefore, our second research question asks: how does the decision-making structure of the hiring committee affect who gets hired?
