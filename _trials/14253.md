abstract: "This project aims to examine the impact of post-marital settlements (i.e., patrilocality and matrilocality) on married womenâ€™s social networks in rural Malawi and estimate its effects on informal insurance, social capital, and investment behavior using a lab-in-the-field experiment, self-reported data, and vignette stories. 

The lab-in-the-field experiment is structured as follows: women participants will be randomly assigned to roles as either decision-makers or associates. Decision-makers will choose between lotteries with varying levels of risk, while associates will decide when and how much to insure the decision-makers. We will manipulate certain conditions to observe if associates' insurance decisions change based on the risk level chosen by the decision-makers, the proportion of people experiencing losses, and the relationship between the decision-maker and the associate (e.g., relative, in-law, friend, acquaintance, stranger). The study will also explore how decision-makers risk-taking behavior is influenced by the availability of support from associates, the potential for performance comparison with others, and the relationship between the decision-maker and the associate.
