abstract: "Kids from poor neighborhoods have typically lower career aspirations than kids from well-off neighborhoods. The gap in aspirations translates into a discrepancy in human capital investment, which causes poverty traps. The aim of this research project is to test whether showing young students the successful careers of professionals who come from the same high-poverty, high-crime neighborhood affects the children’s aspirations and school choices.
Our intervention will target an elementary and middle school in Naples, in a neighborhood with high levels of both poverty and crime. We target students from grades three to eight. Hence, we target students who have not chosen their academic path yet, but who are approaching (some more than others) the choice of high school.
We are organizing a Career Day during the Fall term of the school year. During the Career Day, professionals who come from that neighborhood will share their stories, each of them during a 20-minute presentation. The professionals are people who earned a college degree and are currently employed in a variety of jobs (e.g., as an accountant or psychologist). In his or her speech, each professional will detail his or her current job, the academic path that led to it, his or her motivation and the challenges he or she had to overcome. After the presentations, there will be a Q&A session.
The intervention will be randomized at the class level, with half class being treated and the other half being in the control group. During the intervention, the students in the control group will follow a class on environmental education. We assess the impact of the intervention on academic achievement, high school choice of the students who are now in grade eight, and self-reported aspirations. If proved to be successful, the project represents a cost-effective tool to promote students’ aspirations while potentially reducing crime rate among teenagers.
