abstract: "This study aims to investigate whether the availability of micro-finance loans increases the adoption of an innovative, multi-layered farming model in northern India. The technology in question enables small vegetable growers to plant two different crops simultaneously, via the use of an overground structure. We work with a local NGO to provide informational and technical assistance to all participating households, while randomizing the availability and interest rate of micro-finance loan products.  "
