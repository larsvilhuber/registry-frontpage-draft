abstract: "Pure other regarding preferences have been challenged both in economic and psychological literature. Proponents of strategic other regarding preferences point out that individuals make choices to optimize (reward and punish) others through mechanisms specific to the eventual moral. That is, decision-makers consult their emotions while deciding what and when to give. Even more, when operating within a minimal group, individuals care about what others will do in relation to decisions they are about to make. This pre-analysis plan outlines the intentions of the current study in understanding the preferences for giving towards household shocks within Kenyan communities. Specifically, how empathy, concerns for reputation, and reciprocity mediate charitable giving."
