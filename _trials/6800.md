abstract: "Many existing nutrition interventions evaluate the short-term effects on child health focusing on whether treatment matters for child health. To what degree timing and duration of exposure to a long-term nutrition intervention matter for child development is hardly considered. We want to provide evidence by examining the effectiveness of a hardly implemented government directive in India that postulates all government run schools to improve children’s diets by using iron and iodine fortiﬁed salt called double-fortiﬁed salt [DFS] in the school feeding program. Facilitating the availability of DFS at 107 randomly selected governmental schools in two blocks of the district Jehanabad in the state of Bihar, India, we want to examine how timing and duration of the use of DFS effect child health, cognition, and school outcomes. We contribute to the literature by considering one of the longest treatment periods of DFS in a school feeding program so far almost 4 years. Due to variation in onset and duration of DFS treatment, we include four exposure groups in our study to examine the effectiveness of DFS across different treatment periods. Further, we observe how a childhood intervention unfolds in outcomes for young adolescents. Using three waves of panel data of about 1,000 school children, we analyze the difference in means of the health, cognition, and education outcome variables of four exposure groups.
The results have high policy relevance as they show the potential of fortiﬁed foods in school feeding programs without crowding out other interventions. "
