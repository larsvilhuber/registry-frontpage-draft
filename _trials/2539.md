abstract: "There is a belief that local electoral outcomes are connected with voters’ perception about central governments’ performance and quality.  We implement an experimental study, in the 2017 Portuguese municipal elections. We randomly exposed participants to positive, neutral and negative news about the central government in office. We use a sample of around 3 000 undergraduate and masters students of two business schools in Lisbon. Our goal is to assess how information affects turnout and voting decision – namely, local votes for the central government party – in local elections. Our sample includes subjects who never voted before the 2017 local election, together with more experienced voters. A by-product of our analysis is to test if the impact of information is differentiated across these two subsamples.
