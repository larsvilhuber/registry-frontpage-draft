abstract: "In this study we examine two different financial trainings and compare them against each other. The first financial training is a “rule of thumb” based training that is designed especially for small business owners. The training tries to improve financial behaviors of business owners with a strong focus on improving investment strategies. It also informs about savings, borrowing and risk diversification as means to reach good investment practices. For the second training the content is the same as for the rules of thumbs training but it additionally provides personalized feedback on business owners past financial performance and practices. In addition there is a control group that receives a health and safety related training. We perform these trainings in Kampala, Uganda. Our participants are 500 small and micro entrepreneurs. "
