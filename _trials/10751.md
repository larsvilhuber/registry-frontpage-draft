abstract: "In partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture in Bangladesh, we design and implement an experiment around the promotion of new flood-saline-resilient varieties of seeds for traditionally cultivated crops. The new varieties are promoted to farmer field schools at the village level. We randomize demonstration modalities, varying the number of farmer group members demonstrating the new seed varieties while holding constant the amount of demonstration seed available at the village level. We compare three treatment arms to a control arm that does not receive demonstration resources. "
