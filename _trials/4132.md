abstract: "Many initiatives aim to improve the quality of public services in low-income countries by fostering better governance through citizens’ participation. The underlying theory of change is that end-users have the most at stakes in seeing the availability and quality of services improve.  Few of these initiatives have been rigorously evaluated, and the evidence is mixed. In healthcare, all successful initiatives have included both a substantial dose of training and an expensive, in-person support system from project implementers. This is typically not scalable. Our project aims to test an affordable hence scalable and sustainable mechanism to empower citizens to get involved and improve the quality of public healthcare. We are targeting rural Cote d’Ivoire, where past interventions have failed. In collaboration with the healthcare administration, we are working with CARE Cote d’Ivoire to set-up inclusive management committees that receive assistance and coaching by a Health Management expert via telephone.
