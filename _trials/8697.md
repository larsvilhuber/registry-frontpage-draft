abstract: "Exley (2016) has examined charitable giving behavior under risk, i.e., how much one is willing to improve others’ welfare while sacrificing one’s own welfare. She has found that individuals use risk as excuses not to give when there is self-partner tradeoff. People become more averse to partners’ risk and less averse to self risk. However, many real-life situations are about how much one is ready to benefit from sacrificing others’ welfare or to sacrifice one’s own welfare to benefit others. We investigate the role of risk in these types of situations. In our laboratory experiment, participants make a series of decisions between risky and riskless gains or losses for themselves or their partners. Their altered risk responses between no self-partner tradeoff and self-partner tradeoff will reflect the existence of excuse-driven risk preferences. We expect a reverse pattern of individual risk attitudes in the loss domain, i.e., more seeking to partners’ risk and less seeking to self risk. Moreover, individuals tend to exhibit more excuse-driven risk preferences in the loss domain.
