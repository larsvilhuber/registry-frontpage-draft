abstract: "We compare ambiguity attitudes for natural and artificial sources in both gain and loss domains. In addition, we compare the relationships between the ambiguity attitudes and real behaviors under ambiguity (preventive health and disaster preparedness behaviors) for the natural source with those for the artificial source; this is also examined in both gain and loss domains. Furthermore, we examine heterogeneity in ambiguity attitudes and in the relationship between ambiguity attitudes and real behaviors under ambiguity."
