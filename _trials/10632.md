abstract: "Social exclusion of the poor has a major non material dimension that makes it hard to measure.  In addition, the wide heterogeneity in everyone’s situation of vulnerability suggests that tailored interventions might be more effective than a “one-size-fits-all” poverty alleviation program. The pilot evaluates through a RCT the Cáritas’ new personalized support program for individuals in situation of social exclusion through a community physical space so-called “ACCEDE” space, only available at the treated parishes. We hypothesize that Caritas’ treatment of personalized itinerary will be more effective than their standard operations."
