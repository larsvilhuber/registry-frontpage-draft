abstract: "Firms can harness worker voice to improve labor productivity and retention. By asking workers for their opinions, firms can learn information about worker preferences, production process improvements, and other insights. However, asking workers about their opinions may create the risk of disappointment by changing workers’ reference points. If firms cannot follow through on workers’ suggestions, workers may feel a loss and lower their productivity in response. It is difficult to identify a disappointment effect of worker voice because firm responses to workers’ suggestions are difficult to randomize. I employ an online experiment that randomizes the solicitation of worker input and employer response and uses real effort tasks to test the effect of worker voice with and without follow-through. "
