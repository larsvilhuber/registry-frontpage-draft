abstract: "In economics and political science there is not enough agreement on when deciding whether or not to attend a peaceful protest, people behave as strategic complements or substitutes (that is, whether greater expected participation increases or decreases incentives to participate). Although most theoretical models assume strategic complementarity, recent evidence (Cantoni et. al., 2019) shows that in Hong Kong protests, students behave as strategic substitutes. Our hypothesis is that in contexts where potential participants are heterogeneous---or belong to different groups---it could happen that agents interact as complements with some people/groups, and as substitutes with others. This investigation seeks to study this phenomenon within the context of Women´s Day demonstrations in Chile. By conducting an online survey of female undergraduate students at two universities, we will measure initial intention to participate in Women´s Day protests. Then, using that same data we inform students of the expected assistance of different groups and measure the effects of changes in expectations of participation on final intention to attend the march. Therefore, allowing us to identify the degree of strategic substitutability or complementarity 
in the decision to protest within contexts of heterogeneous agents. "
