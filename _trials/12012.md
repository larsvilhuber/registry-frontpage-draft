abstract: "Social norms guide human behavior in various contexts, even when violating them does not lead to immediate material costs. However, there are situations where it is unclear if a norm exists, or if different subgroups follow different norms. Existing methods of norm elicitation fail to capture this uncertainty, which can have significant consequences in both economic and social contexts. This experiment investigates the presence of multiple social norms employing a new elicitation method under two different economic games: a simple dictator game and a more complex economic problem involving trade-offs between a selfish, an equitable, a rawlsian, and an efficient option. Our design allows us to incentive-compatibly elicit multiple norms and sheds light on the extent to which people are aware of such multiplicity."
