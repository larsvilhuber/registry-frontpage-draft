abstract: "Building on insights from Dhar (2021), this project sheds light on the preferences for future partners in the Indian marriage market context. We conduct a series of online experiments on an Indian marriage market website to assess four questions: 1. How do men's preferences for a working/non-working future wife affect the response rates from women? 2. How does the relative education level of men and women affect the response rates? 3. How does the preference for living with family or not affect the response rates? and 4. How do the beliefs in caste affect the response rates for both men and women? This experiment will examine the impact of different preferences on the matching processes in the Indian marriage market and will thereby highlight the relevant norms that influence marital outcomes."
