abstract: "We study professionalsâ€™ motivations for providing information on a job's time demands to jobseekers. To do so, we conduct a survey experiment in which professionals are asked to provide information about their former employer to a hypothetical jobseeker. We randomize the characteristics (gender, desire to have children) of the jobseeker, the availability of information about jobseekers' preferences for information, and the recruitment motives of the professional. We will test how these conditions affect the professionals' time allocation among various topics."
