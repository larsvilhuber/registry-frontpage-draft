abstract: "Research has shown that giving disadvantaged families financial incentives to invest in their children could decrease socioeconomic inequality by enhancing human capital formation. Yet, within the household how are such gains achieved? We use a field experiment to investigate how parents allocate time when they receive financial incentives. We measure parental investment using the time parents report spending with each child in the family. We aim to determine whether financial incentives increase investment in target children, potentially at the expense of time spent with non-targeted children."
