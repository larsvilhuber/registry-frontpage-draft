abstract: "First year bachelor students in Economics&Management at the University of Geneva (CH) are offered access to a live streaming platform allowing to attend on-line the lectures of many of their compulsory courses. Access to the platform is randomized both across students and over weeks of the term, so that the same student could attend the classes online in some weeks but not others. Furthermore, we construct a mapping of all questions in the final exams to the weeks of the term in which the material was covered. Thus, we can exploit variation both across and within students and weeks. Classroom attendance is always available to all students, allowing us to study students' choices of attendance mode. 
We examine the experimental effects on in-class attendance and exam grades.
