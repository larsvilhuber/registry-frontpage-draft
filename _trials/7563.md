abstract: "Based on theoretical predictions, I conduct a laboratory experiment to explore whether (a) self-image concerns are reference-dependent and (b) loss aversion applies to self-image concerns. I let subjects work on an IQ test, a self-image-relevant task, and induce an exogenous shift in complexity designed to put them at either gain or loss in self-image. Then, I elicit their willingness to acquire feedback. Considering potentially asymmetric belief updating, I analyze whether subjects who experience loss in self-image are more likely to acquire feedback compared to those with a loss in this domain."
