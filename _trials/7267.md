abstract: "This project evaluates the potential for technology to alleviate constraints on local tax capacity. Working in collaboration with a local government and a local private firm in Ghana, the project randomizes the availability of technology for tax collectors in the field. Collectors face several constraints to achieve their objectives of delivering bills and collecting tax payments which technology may partly remove. In addition, we study whether the presence of technology impacts property owners' belief about capacity of the state and engagement with local officials."
