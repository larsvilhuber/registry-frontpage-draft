abstract: "Salience theory (Bordalo et al., 2012) predicts that choices between two lotteries are driven not only  by  the  marginal  distributions of the  lotteries,  but  also  by  the  correlation  between  the  two lotteries.  Existing studies testing this prediction fail to control for event-splitting effects.  In this paper, we seek to disentangle the role of correlation and event-splitting in two settings:  1) choices between Mao pairs as studied by Dertwinkel-Kalt and Köster (2019); 2) the Allais paradox.  We further test for correlation effects in a novel task in which subjects have to choose between two lotteries with the same marginal distribution. This task allows to detect correlation effects even when they are of second-order importance only."
