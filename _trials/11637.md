abstract: "The aim of this incentivized survey experiment is to elicit households’ willingness to pay (WTP) for programmable heating thermostats. Digital technologies are seen as a promising way to mitigate climate change by reducing energy demand, especially by combining technology with behavioral interventions such as real-time feedback or social comparisons.
The heating sector of private households is an important lever to reduce GHG emissions. While energy retrofits (e.g. facade insulation) promise substantial energy savings, they are often very costly, not only in terms of pecuniary costs but also other costs, such as time, noise and dirt during construction. Moreover, insulation is often not attractive for landlords to conduct and can only in rare cases be conducted by tenants in multiple apartment buildings. In addition to saving energy, programmable heating thermostats are designed to increase consumer utility by reducing the amount of changes and adjustments required by users. Despite these seemingly attractive attributes, as of 2022, only 8% of households in Germany have installed programmable thermostats (Statista, 2022).
Given this low penetration of programmable thermostats among German households, I aim to understand households’ valuation for programmable thermostats by eliciting the WTP in an incentivized survey experiment. The goal of the experiment is twofold: First, I investigate whether the low of share of programmable thermostats among private households is a reflection of well-informed preferences or ignorance. To this end, I test the effect of two different types of information on the WTP. Second, I want to study the role of using a lottery to make the experiment incentive compatible and consequential (this has especially been discussed in the context of public goods, see e.g. Vossler et al., 2012; Carson et al., 2014) for elicited WTP values. As researchers are often financially restricted when it comes to ensuring that choices in an experiment are incentive compatible and consequential, using a lottery to select only a certain percentage of respondents seems as a good compromise. However, if elicited preferences/WTP values differed depending on the probability of being selected, this would be important to consider when comparing results from experiments with different winning probabilities in incentivized settings."
