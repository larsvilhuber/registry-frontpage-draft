abstract: "More information should always be better, but it can have negative consequences, especially when the information is negative. For example, bad news can be demotivating. Relatedly, people may avoid freely available information, especially if it contains bad news. In this paper, we ask: How can we mitigate the negative effects of bad news? We test ways to mitigate potential negative effects of negative information using a randomized field experiment. We collaborate with a large company selling wearable activity trackers that provide users with personal information on the duration and quality of their sleep. We conduct an experiment with 1 million users for 4 weeks that randomizes the content of messages that goes along with information when the quality of their sleep has dropped. The types of messaging we test not only measures the most effective content at preventing negative consequences of bad news, but also information avoidance and boosting effort/motivation. They also provide insight into the mechanisms of how types of information can affect behavior. Therefore, we can apply these types of messaging to improve the deliverance of other information in general. It has clear implications on how to help firms and other organizations deliver crucial negative information to their users in a more effective manner. "
