abstract: "In urban informal settlement areas of Nairobi (Kenya), as throughout sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), women’s ability to achieve economic autonomy is often curtailed by their concurrent responsibility to care for young children. In this paper, we present our pre-analysis plan of our randomized experiment to assess the effects of subsidized and improved quality daycare on women’s engagement with the labor force in an informal settlement area of Nairobi. Approximately 1,200 mothers with children aged 1 to 3 will be enrolled in our study.  One third of these women will be randomly assigned to receive vouchers for a full year of free child care at local daycare facilities.  Another third will be given similar vouchers at daycare facilities where child care providers will receive enhanced early childhood care and education (ECCE) training and materials to improve the quality of services. The remaining third will act as our comparison group. Our analyses will focus on the effects of this intervention on three primary outcomes 1) women’s labor force participation, 2) hours worked, and 3) household income."
