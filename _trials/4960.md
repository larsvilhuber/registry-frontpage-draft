abstract: "This study aims to analyze the extent to which local community leaders in local government authorities can be leveraged to increase property tax collection in a developing country context. The property tax collection system is one of the main sources of revenue for many countries. Unfortunately, in Tanzania, property tax collection is as low compared to other types of tax such as VAT and Pay as You Earn (PAYE) tax. The Property tax collection in Tanzania is as low as 30% of the total expected revenue from property tax. The government has been changing strategies on collecting property tax, these include both centralized and decentralized approaches, but with less significant impact on compliance. 
The study design employs a randomized control trial to assess the effect of messaging strategies and the involvement of local leaders/authorities to increase tax collection in Tanzania. Participants were randomly allocated to three treatment arms and a control group. The first treatment arm involved SMS reminder with a threat of fine, which is standard in tax compliance literature. The second treatment arm combined treatment for the first arm with an additional threat of involvement of local leaders in the tax collection process. The third arm involved the treatment in the first arm with an actual request for help from local leaders to increase tax compliance. Therefore, the innovation and value addition of this study to the existing body of literature stems from two additional experimental treatments in the second and third treatment arms stated above. While we acknowledge that there are many studies using SMS reminders/threats of fine to influence tax compliance; we leverage this strategy to study the additional effect of the involvement of local authorities in tax compliance.
