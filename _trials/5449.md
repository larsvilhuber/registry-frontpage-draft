abstract: "Anaemia prevalence among children is high in rural Bihar, India. As anaemia has adverse effects on attentiveness and the ability to concentrate as well as cognitive development of children, finding channels to combat anaemia is a key concern of the central and state governments of India. Iron-deficiency is a major factor contributing to anaemia in general and it is presumed to be the case in Bihar as well.
We implement an iron-supplementation intervention targeted at children aged 3 to 6 years who attend pre-primary childcare centres, called Anganwadi Centres, in Madhepura district in Bihar, India. Anganwadi Centres are part of the Integrated Child Development Services Scheme, a government programme aiming to improve child health and development. The study evaluates the introduction of a sustainable method of low-dosed iron supplementation, a reusable iron ingot, in the institution of Anganwadi Centres and its potential to reduce iron-deficiency anaemia among children. 

This study is currently on hold due to the corona pandemic. It is not possible to conduct the study in Anganwadi Centres at the moment."
