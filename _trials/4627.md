abstract: "Following the launch of the 2015-2020 National Mental Health Strategy by the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) Lebanon, the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP) proceeded with the integration of Mental Health (MH) into Primary Healthcare (PHC) centres across Lebanon, in collaboration with the PHC Department. An important component of this integration aims at increasing the detection, assessment and management of depression. As a result, the MNHP trained social workers and medical staff in 75 PHC centres to screen patients for depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 is a diagnostic tool that consists of nine questions designed to detect the presence and severity of depression. Patients who score more than 4 points on the PHQ9 questionnaire should ideally follow-up with their health provider to determine whether or not symptoms are improving, and which symptoms are, or are not, improving. Follow-up can take place any time within 2 to 4 weeks.

Against this background, Nudge Lebanon, in collaboration with the MNHP designed and implemented a behavioral intervention to: a) increase the likelihood of patients diagnosed with depression to come back within 2 to 4 weeks for a follow-up assessment; and b) improve patientsâ€™ self-awareness of their daily mood changes and mental health state prior to the appointment date. The intervention consisted of a self-report card that tracks daily mood changes of patients who were diagnosed with depression (PHQ-9 > 4) over a period of two to three weeks. The self-assessment card also acted as a constant reminder for patients to attend their pre-scheduled follow-up appointment.

The intervention was conducted in one PHC that operates under the supervision of the MoPH, and that is highly compliant with mental health requirements and procedures.
