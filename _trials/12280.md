abstract: "Expectations have been shown to play an important role in shaping individual behavior. However, little work has investigated the role that expectations regarding the timing of outcomes play in intertemporal decision making. We conduct a study to in which we exogenously manipulate subjects' expectations of when they will receive payment. Our objective is to test whether the elicited time preferences of individuals are affected by these expectations in a way that is consistent with our hypotheses, which are motivated by a simple application of the theory of expectations-based reference-dependent preferences (Koszegi and Rabin, 2006; 2007) applied to intertemporal choice problems."
