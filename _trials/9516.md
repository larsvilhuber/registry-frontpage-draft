abstract: "In France, the unemployment rate of vocational students is high compared to apprentices who get the same diploma. In this project, we evaluate a counseling and job search assistance program for vocational students. The program consists of two parts: 

First, the students participate in a general counseling program. This is a group-level treatment which takes place in classes during regular school times.  This part of the program complements courses provided by teachers aiming to help students for their professional orientation. These courses contain elements of job search counseling. This phase is prepared upstream by teacher training carried out in collaboration with consultants from the temporary employment company Adecco. The teachers then prepare the students for the interventions of the Adecco consultants in the classrooms. The consultants intervene for 8 hours in each class.

Second, half of the students are followed up and get individual job search assistance with proposals of job offers. This part of the program starts after the graduation of the vocational students and it is a one-to-one treatment. The program is delivered by Adecco consultants from mid-June to October. 

We randomize at three levels. First, we randomly select schools. One group will participate in the program (treated schools), while schools of the other group do not get any treatment (control schools). Second, within the treated schools, we randomize at the class level. The students in the treated classes participate in the group-level counseling program delivered by the caseworkers. Third, for the second part of the program, which occurs after graduation, we randomize at the student level within the treated classes. The caseworker will offer individual job search assistance to the randomly selected students. Together this enables us to analyze (i) the impact of the counseling program delivered by Adecco consultants compared to a standard course of professional orientation provided by teachers, and (ii) the impact of a one-to-one job search assistance program."
