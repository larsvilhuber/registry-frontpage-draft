abstract: "The Strengthening the Implementation of Responsible Fatherhood Programs (SIRF) aims to identify and test approaches to improve recruitment, engagement, and retention of fathers in responsible fatherhood programs using rapid learning cycles. The study includes 10 programs – 9 of which have received Family-focused, Interconnected, Resilient and Essential (Fatherhood FIRE) grants from the Office of Family Assistance in the US Department of Human Services – testing interventions over a one-year period in one of three broad categories:
•	Coaching. Coaching techniques are employed in case management. Staff members use open-ended questions to talk with fathers about their goals and how to achieve them. This approach is designed to increase the number of fathers who complete the program.
•	Outreach. Programs use innovative ways of conducting outreach and intake to enroll more fathers into programs and encourage more fathers to show up for initial workshops.
•	Peer support. Program alumni or fathers with experience with the program serve as mentors to new fathers with the aim of increasing the number of fathers who persist through the program.
