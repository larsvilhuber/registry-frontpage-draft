abstract: "This study explores how own and second-order perceptions within agricultural networks affect individuals’ willingness to experiment with new and sustainable agricultural practices (organic fertilizer). Specifically, we investigate the beliefs about whether a lower greenness level of rice fields is a subject of gossip in the village and how these second-order perceptions relate to farmers stated willingness to experiment with a new practice - if that practice is believed to lead to less green rice fields. Further, we explore how these second-order perceptions relate to own perceptions about the importance on greenness, to farmers’ use of chemical fertilizers and how these perceptions are correlated within agricultural networks and with farmers’ position within such networks

We use two in-survey experiments to derive causal evidence on how stated willingness to experiment with new farming practices change if second-order perceptions are made more salient to a farmer. Specifically, in the first survey experiment (survey 1) we ask about the willingness to experiment with the new practice but randomize whether the question about possible gossip related to less green fields appears before or after the willingness question and thereby make the point of possible gossip more salient. In a second survey (with a different sample of respondents), we repeat a similar experiment, in which, however, we add a second question related to the greenness level of fields to the randomized question order, such that the treatment effect is supposed to be stronger in comparison to having only one question (as in survey 1). This second question asks respondents to compare the greenness level of their own and others' rice fields, thereby inducing additional salience of the social importance of greenness levels.

Additionally, we investigate not only stated willingness to experiment but also look on actual (dis)adoption behaviour of different fertilizers after a randomized organic farming training intervention and investigate how such adoption behaviours are influenced with own and second-order perceptions before the training intervention.

The study is set in the context of Indonesia, where rice farming is the major income source and where the greenness level of rice fields is often seen as a sign of farm management quality. While nitrogen is a key determinant of rice plant growth and leaf greenness, overuse of nitrogen can have severe negative environmental impacts. The over-application of chemical fertilizers containing nitrogen and thereby ensuring a dark, sophisticated green of the plants, is a widespread phenomenon in Indonesia. We will explore perceptions revolving around greenness, whether fertilizer use behaviour is related to these perceptions and how such perceptions could affect the adoption of sustainable farming practices. The results of this study will provide relevant information for local NGOs working in the context of sustainable agriculture and the Indonesian Government which itself aims to increase the application of sustainable farming practices in the country.
