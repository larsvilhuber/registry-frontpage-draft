abstract: "The agricultural industry faces the increasing need to adapt to the dynamics of the production and markets environment. Changes in the production environment as for example, increase resistance to chemical for established diseases, appearance of new diseases, adaptability to climate change and so on; coupled with ever increasing consumers' expectation for food, increase the need to use novel technologies to develop improved foods. In the case of fresh fruits, the novel development technologies are breeding methods. However, consumers often exhibit and stigma to new food development technologies. This study seeks to estimate the trade-offs consumers make for improved horticultural and quality attributes of table grapes in presence of gene editing (e.g., CRISPR) a novel breeding technique.  "
