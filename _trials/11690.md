abstract: "There is evidence in the literature that individuals engage in sequential search (i.e. they evaluate options in a choice menu in sequence) and satisficing (i.e. they stop search after reaching a certain utility threshold). Moreover, individuals have been shown to be overloaded by too much choice and, consequently, may prefer to restrict the size of the choice set. In this work, we develop and experimentally test a theory of sequential choice that predicts that individuals may prefer smaller choice sets to larger ones. In our theory, individuals may prefer smaller menus as they lower psychological costs from leaving options unevaluated and reduce the incentives to over-search. 

In our experiment, subjects play a number of rounds where a round involves choosing an option from a choice set of either size 10 or 20 via a sequential procedure. An option is comprised of a number of attributes, each with some dollar value, and the sum of these attributes is the overall dollar value of that option. There are two treatments: a simple treatment where options are comprised of three attributes and a complex treatment in which options are comprised of seven attributes. Moreover, within each treatment, there are two parts. In Part A, the size of the choice set faced is fixed while in Part B, the size of the choice set is determined by the subjects themselves. Our objective is to analyze whether the following aspects are consistent with our theory: (1) how subjects make their choice sequentially, (2) whether subjects restrict the choice set, and (3) how (1) and (2) vary with the complexity of options.
