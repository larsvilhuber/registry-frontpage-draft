abstract: "This project explores the role of stress and time management strategies adopted by Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) female owners in response to daily “shocks” in explaining profits and growth. To do this, I compare the impact of a stress-management cognitive-behavioural intervention with that of non-directive counselling on well-being, time use, managerial practices and firm outcomes among female entrepreneurs in Bangladesh. I hypothesise that daily hassles associated with both the nature of self-employment and social norms in Bangladesh interfere with entrepreneurial decision making and the adoption of managerial practices by women, and this, in turn, affects firm performance. Because previous research on managerial practices and firm performance has documented gender differences in time use and investment decisions, the cognitive-behavioural arm of the program features priority-setting and time-allocation exercises, as well as problem-solving and relaxation techniques. The project seeks to pinpoint important sources of stress and to provide a window into non-financial barriers to female entrepreneurship and firm growth in Bangladesh.
