abstract: "This study investigates consumption segregation in urban areas and explores whether creating opportunities for consumption in historically segregated neighborhoods can modify individual behaviors and promote the integration of these communities. Drawing on the contact hypothesis, which posits that intergroup interaction reduces prejudice, our experiment in Tulsa, Oklahoma, examines whether exposure to consumption opportunities in North and East Tulsa—predominantly Black neighborhoods with a history of segregation—can alter consumption patterns among residents from different areas within the city. Participants in our study are selected from neighborhoods outside North and East Tulsa and are randomly assigned to either engage with local vendors in these neighborhoods through a social event or to a control group visiting a neutral site. By analyzing transaction and survey data, we aim to determine whether direct consumption experiences in segregated areas lead to lasting behavioral changes in consumption patterns. This research provides valuable insights into potential strategies for reducing urban consumption segregation and mitigating its socio-economic consequences."
