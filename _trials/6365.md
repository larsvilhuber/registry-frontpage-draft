abstract: "This is a registry for our pilot survey. We will estimate a structural model of anti-Chinese xenophobia using an exogenous variation from an information randomized controlled trial. The structural model explains anti-Chinese xenophobia using two motivations, intrinsic and reputational. Intrinsic motivation is captured by a measure which we call “anti-Chinese animus”. It is measured by self-reports in multiple questions. To defend these measures from potential social desirability bias, we ask List randomization questions. Reputational motivation is captured by people’s concern about other people's perception of their anti-Chinese animus if their behaviors are publicly observable.

The intrinsic and reputational motivations will jointly determine people’s xenophobic actions against Chinese. To measure xenophobic behaviors, we will use three outcome measures: a petition, a dictator game, and a donation question. The dictator game is an incentivized survey item with real money at stake, and the other two questions ask about intentions to donate and to sign a petition.

To achieve this purpose, we have an information RCT. We will randomly choose half of the respondents and show them an animation that describes rising anti-Chinese sentiment in the US, the control group will not see the animation. The animation aims to shift respondents’ perception of the acceptability of xenophobic behaviors against Chinese, which can potentially change the reputational motivation.
