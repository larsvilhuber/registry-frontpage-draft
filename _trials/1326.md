abstract: "This document describes the analysis plan for a field experiment evaluating the effects of direct
mailing on preferences for redistribution. We consider the case of the vote on the unconditional
basic income (henceforth UBI) which takes place in Switzerland in June 2016. Approximately
one week before the vote, different types of letters are sent to almost 2/3 of the swiss municipalities
with less than 750 households. These municipalities receive either a placebo letter which
reminds them to go voting, or a letter containing the same content as the placebo letter, but
also information about inequality, poverty and likely labor supply responses to the UBI. This
document outlines the econometric methods that will be used to assess the effect of the letters
on our main outcome variables."
