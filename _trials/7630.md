abstract: "An important impediment to the development of the digital economy in middle-income countries is the low rate of digital payments made by consumers (Cheng, 2019). In this experiment, we test how different online-offer conditions affect customers’ intention to buy a product, and their trust in the seller. We conduct a scenario-based experiment among North African consumers, comparing the effects of admitting online-payments only (vs cash-on-delivery), and of offering free returns (vs no returns). Additionally, we compare the effects among a sample of North African consumers to a sample of European consumers.
