abstract: "We propose an attention-based mechanism for habit formation and contrast its predictions with those from Stigler and Becker (1977)’s consumption-based mechanism. We develop a habit formation model that nests both mechanisms and structurally estimate it using real-time feedback and consumption data from a large-scale field experiment in shower water consumption. Identification comes from a novel experimental design that varies real-time feedback cycles that temporarily draw attention to individu- als’ water consumption costs. Using the model, we validate an attention-based mechanism, show that attention-based habits form quickly and decay slowly, and uncover a new solution concept for optimizing feedback interventions to create sustained behavioral change."
