abstract: "Positive Deviance (PD) is an asset-based approach to solving intractable social problems. In poor communities in many developing countries there exist households, schools, teachers and children who are achieving better learning than the majority of their peers. In this study, we replicate the practices of these positive deviants in neighboring school communities in a region that has consistently underachieved nationally.  "
