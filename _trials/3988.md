abstract: "We study what black and white respondents know about the economic circumstances and opportunities of their own racial group, as well as the other racial groups. We check how these perceptions compare to reality and how they shape attitudes towards government intervention and policies. We randomly provide respondents information about the historical evolution of earnings for black and white men and women, as well as about the social mobility for black and white children and see how this shapes their views about racial disparities and government policies. We also conduct a simplified survey on very young people aged 13 to 18 to measure their perceptions and attitudes on race related topics. We focus on this age group since these teenage years are very impressionable years in which people form their views and this will help us to understand at what age certain attitudes already become well-established in people minds. We collect a second wave of respondents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Comparing them to the previous wave, we are able to check how this crisis affected people's perceptions and their policy preferences."
