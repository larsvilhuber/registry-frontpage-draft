abstract: "This study examines the effects of neglecting correlation in choice under risk. While alternative theories of choice under risk, such as regret aversion theory (Loomes and Sudgen, 1987) and salience theory (Bordalo, Gennaioli and Shleifer, 2012) suggest agents attend to the underlying correlation and derive utility from state contingencies, it remains an open question how people process these decisions. The repercussions of correlation neglect have paramount implications for the modern portfolio theory for risk-averse agents who seek to minimize variance for a given expected return (Markowitz, 1952). Relatedly, it may lead to missed hedging or arbitrage opportunities (Eyster and Weizsacker, 2016). How people process correlated risky choice in the evaluation of trade-offs between different options is largely endogenous though likely the decision process is influenced by the framing or presentation of lotteries. This experiment exogenously induces or suppresses subjects' focus towards the underlying correlation between lotteries through a dynamic display. The experiment will be augmented with eye-tracking measures to estimate the effects of decision heuristics on choices. While eye-tracking data are endogenous given that a subject elects how to disperse attention throughout the screen, the random treatment assignment will be used as an instrument to estimate the effects of these data given that they induce differential decision processes.
