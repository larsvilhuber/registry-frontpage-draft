abstract: "We study whether and how much AI technologies improve learning and educational outcomes in a tertiary education context. We test this question using a large-scale randomized field experiment. Adapting an encouragement design, we evaluate which students select into usage of a targeted AI assistant within an online educational program, and assess the effects of this AI assistant on educational outcomes using data on study progress and grades based on admin data from the university.
