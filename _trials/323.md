abstract: "        In developing countries, individuals are often exposed to unexpected financial shocks, which may lead to costly risk-coping behaviors.  Individuals may be constrained from precautionary saving, which could help them cope with these shocks.  Two constraints highlighted in the literature are self-control and social appropriation.  Out study attempts to alleviate these two constraints through an intervention involving the provision of mobile banking savings accounts that are labeled for specific goals including unexpected/emergency expenses.  The use of labeled savings accounts has been shown to be effective at increasing savings, with speculative evidence pointing suggesting that labeled savings accounts induce mental accounting. 
       We focus on vulnerable women (widowed, divorced, separated) in Nyanza, Kenya, where access to formal financial services is low.  We ask whether labeled mobile banking accounts earmarked for emergencies increases individual saving.  "
