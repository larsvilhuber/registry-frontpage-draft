abstract: "We study reporting behavior when a fraction of subject decisions are observed by the experimenter. In a laboratory experiment, we utilize an adapted Fischbacher and Follmi-Heusi (2013) die-roll task to implement the intervention. We use this experiment to test equilibrium predictions of lying models that consider a social image cost."
