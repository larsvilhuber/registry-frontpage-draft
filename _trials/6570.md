abstract: "Do experts adjust their policy recommendations when the facts change? We conduct a randomized experiment among 1,224 economic experts across 109 countries
with two treatments. The first treatment is variation in the initial spread of Covid-
19 during March 2020. The second treatment informs experts about their countries’ past macroeconomic performance. Greater exposure to Covid-19 decreases
the probability to recommend contractionary fiscal policies. A better macroeconomic performance increases the probability to implement contractionary policies
and reduces the exposure effect to Covid-19. Sentiment analyses suggest that the
policy recommendations are caused by Bayesian information up-dating and not by
changes in preferences."
