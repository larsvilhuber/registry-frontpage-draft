abstract: "Remote and short-term work arrangements are increasingly common despite the limited incentives they provide for acquiring firm-specific knowledge. This study examines the importance and cost-effectiveness of firm-specific training for remote contract workers using a field experiment run among short-term, outside sales people employed by an insurance firm in Northern Kenya. In particular, I test whether whether giving these workers the option to invest in firm-specific training through a mobile training application affects their performance, retention, and subsequent firm earnings, and how this varies with monetary and competition-based incentives to invest in the training. Preliminary findings demonstrate that having access to firm-specific training significantly increases worker performance. These results suggest that the provision of low cost, firm-specific training to short-term workers has the potential to significantly increase firm performance and that workers facing pay-for-performance incentives are frequently willing to invest in this training with little to no added incentives to do so. This study has implications for our understanding of short-term and remote worker management, and for our understanding of the development of the contract labor market and the on-demand economy more generally."
