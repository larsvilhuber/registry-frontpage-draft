abstract: "Billionaires in the United States lead highly visible lives. The media extensively covers their romantic relationships and various aspects of their personal lives. Even superhero movies portray characters with billionaire status. According to some accounts, billionaires pay considerably lower tax rates compared to the average American. Does their public image influence the demand for taxation of the super-wealthy? We designed a survey experiment aimed at examining how public perceptions of billionaires impact their attitudes toward taxation."
