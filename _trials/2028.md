abstract: "We will recruit survey participants on MTurk to conduct an online survey. With this survey, we plan to study whether the legitimacy (in the sense of conformity to the law) of a certain political view also affects its social desirability. 
First, all subjects will answer a few demographic questions. Second, they will be asked about their opinion on prohibiting the building of minarets. Third, they will be asked to participate in a dictator game where they will have to split $3 between them and another subject. They will be randomized into four groups. Subjects in the control group will only be told that the other subject is a 24-year-old male from Switzerland. Subjects in the "anti-minarets" treatment group will be also told that the other subject is against the building of minarets. Subjects in the "anti-minarets public support" will additionally be told that the 57.5% of Swiss voters is against minarets. Finally, subjects in the "anti-minarets legitimacy" will be additionally told that following the result of a referendum in 2009, building minarets is illegal in Switzerland.
Our main hypotheses are:
1) The donation rates will be reduced in the "anti-minarets" when compared to the donation rates in the control group.
2) The donation rates will be increased in the "anti-minarets legitimacy" when compared to the donation rates in the "anti-minarets public support" group.

In a follow-up experiment, we recruit participants through an online panel survey firm who previously self-identified to the firm as Democrats. We study how the 2016 US presidential election changed people’s interpretation of observed xenophobic expression. First, all participants answer a few demographic questions. Second, the participants (player 1) are asked to play a dictator game with a random participant to a previous study (player 2) that they are matched with. Players 1 are informed that in the other study player 2 authorized a donation to an anti-immigration organization. We cross-randomize whether we tell player 1 that: i) Trump or Clinton won the election in player 2’s area (respectively "Trump won" and "Clinton won" treatment); and ii) player 2’s donation was in private or publicly observable on a website shared with other participants from his/her area (respectively "private" treatment and 'public" treatment). Our hypothesis is that player 1 donation rates to player 2 will be higher in the "Trump won public" treatment than in the other three treatment conditions."
