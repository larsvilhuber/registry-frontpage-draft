abstract: "Corruption, fraud, clientelism, and other normatively-unacceptable behaviors are of great practical and social-scientific interest, but they are difficult to study because they are difficult to measure. Survey respondents, in particular, are likely to underreport having partaken in, or witnessed, such behaviors. This study uses an experimental design to assess the biases of different methods of surveying people about their cheating behavior."
