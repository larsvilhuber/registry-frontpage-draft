abstract: "This trial will investigate the potential effects of an information campaign providing individual information on tax payment, government national expenditure (what expenditure areas (education, health, etc.) is tax money spent on) and on national and regional use of government funds (what concrete policies the government spends on) to a large sample of chilean tax payers. A final treatment consists in allowing taxpayers to provide feedback to government regarding how taxpayer resources should be spent by the government. Using a randomized controlled trial, we will evaluate the impact of these different treatments in order to asses which one is most effective to increase government transparency perception and trust in the government. Finally, we will test the effects of these interventions on peoples actual behavior: tax compliance and voting participation.  "
