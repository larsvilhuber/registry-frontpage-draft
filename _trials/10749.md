abstract: "This study investigates which type of central bank communication helps to anchor medium-run inflation expectations in the face of above-target inflation. For this purpose, we run randomized control trials on a representative sample of German consumers as follows. First, we collect socio-demographic variables, inflation and financial literacy, general knowledge and trust in the European Central Bank (the ECB), and point inflation perceptions and expectations. Then, the respondents are randomly allocated to six groups, including five treated groups and one control group, which receives no information. Each treated group receives one of the following information: (1) a text about the ECB’s inflations projection, (2) a text about the ECB’s inflation target, (3) a text about a statement of the ECB’s president, (4) a text about the ECB’s inflations projections and a statement of the ECB’s president, and (5) a text about the ECB’s inflations target and a statement of the ECB’s president. The control group does not receive any information. The treatments allow us to compare the effect of the different information (projection, target, general statement) against the control group with no information and additionally allow us to test how combining numerical information about either the target or the projection with a text emphasizing the ECB’s determination to tackle inflation affects the anchoring.
After providing information treatments, we ask respondents the minimum and the maximum values of expected inflation over different horizons (short- and medium-run) and ask them the probability on a 0-100 scale that the average inflation expectations will be higher than the mid-point between the reported minimum and maximum. These questions allow us to measure the mean and uncertainty of posterior inflation expectations. We also ask some hypothetical questions about unexpected changes in inflation expectations, trust in the ECB's ability to deliver price stability in the medium term, as well as some questions to construct a consumer sentiment index. 
We analyze the following hypotheses:
Which type of communication helps to anchor medium-run inflation expectations in the face of above-target inflation?
Which type of communication best boosts/stabilizes trust in the central bank as well as trust that the ECB can reach its inflation target? 
What is the effect of different types of central bank communication on consumer sentiment?
