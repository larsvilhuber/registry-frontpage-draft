abstract: "This project seeks to assess how an intervention - growth mindset workshops for 5th grade teachers - impacts teachers’ ways of thinking about their own attitudes, and how these changes impact their attitudes toward students in the classroom, and, consequently, students’ results. Specifically, we would like to understand the impact of issues related to teachers’ mindsets that are particular to the context of students in vulnerable situations (such as in public schools of Rio de Janeiro municipality, Brazil). For this purpose, we ran a two-level clustered randomized experiment with treatment at the second (school) level. We randomly selected 50% of 178 candidate schools from the municipality into a treatment group and the other 50% into a control group. The randomization was done by pairing, using the predicted value of the students' results inferred from the characteristics of the schools in previous years. Next, we will assess how much teachers’ and their students’ mindsets changed as a result of the intervention. We will also measure, through classroom observations, how teachers’ practices, performance and dynamics within their classes are being impacted by the intervention. Finally, we will look at how this process ultimately affects student scores in standardized tests. This experiment allows us to address the following set of questions: do teachers working with students in vulnerable social contexts change their pedagogical practices after the proposed intervention? Do such changes influence the outcomes of their students? Do these changes ameliorate students’, classes’ and schools’ achievement gaps? Ultimately, we believe that investigating the entire causal chain linking the teacher's shift in mindset to eventual reductions in academic performance inequalities within the classroom is critical to maximizing the impacts of such interventions."
