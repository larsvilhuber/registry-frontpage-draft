abstract: "We run two independent experiments to test the impact of financial scarcity on economic decision making. In the laboratory study, we exogenously introduce financial scarcity by randomly assigning a high or a low initial endowment to student subjects. In the field experiment, we compared rural residents from relatively rich and poor rural areas to characterize financial scarcity from external environment. We capture current pressure by comparing parents with differnet number of children in rural area, and examine long-term financial pressure by comparing parents with two boys to parents with other types of children in high bribe price regions. The core hypothesis of this study posits that financial scarcity prompts individuals to prioritize  "saving money" over "making money" when faced with conflicting decisions. This fundamental conflict in decision-making can be manifested and empirically tested across various economic games."
