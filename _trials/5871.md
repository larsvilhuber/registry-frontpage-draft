abstract: "The burden of diabetes is a growing global problem, not only for patients and families, but also for health insurance providers and the wider economy. Much of this is driven by lifestyle, such as what we eat and drink, smoking and how little we exercise. Health-related behaviour is difficult to shift. Measuring and tracking behaviour in the field is often a challenge. Wearable health-monitoring technology may offer innovative solutions for lifestyle modification, as well as the study of it. We want to understand how we can support diabetes patients form sustainable healthy-eating habits and increase glucose control. Our study is incorporating the behavioral changes that the COVID-19 pandemic may influence in this high risk population. It will be critical to understand the impact of the pandemic on this at risk population and to learn how we could better support the diabetic community to adapt to these changes. Better disease management will reflect a lower risk of co-morbidities such as cardiovascular disease and severe COVID-19 illness. Overall, this research is highly relevant in the context of the global chronic disease burden, the COVID-19 pandemic, and preventing diabetes-related complications in particular.
