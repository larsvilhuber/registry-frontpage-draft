abstract: "Research has shown that young babies and children living in rural China are not reaching their full developmental potential. A 2013 survey of 2,000 rural (country-based) infants aged 6-12 months in Shaanxi Province, for example, showed that around 40% were significantly delayed in either their cognitive (thinking) or psychomotor (physical) development. Furthermore, rather than improving over time, the number of children suffering from developmental delays actually increased to 53% as the children became toddlers, indicating that rural children are falling further and further behind their healthy urban (town-based) counterparts. The Chinese Ministry of Health is aware of these numbers and is extremely concerned, as these infants represent nearly one-half of all those in China.
Why are rural Chinese children performing so poorly, and what can be done to solve this problem? A growing number of economic and psychology studies point to the importance of early childhood interventions (or programmes) for reaching childhood development milestones. The critical period before age two or three is considered to be a crucial “window”, during which interventions designed to improve cognitive development can have significant and lasting effects, even into adulthood. There is evidence to suggest that this critical developmental window is being ignored in rural China. Previous research suggests that only 13 percent of parents read or tell stories to their children. There is evidence that many rural Chinese babies live a life of silence, with minimal interaction with their adult caregivers. Indeed, many caregivers fully admit to not engaging with their young children as much as they might. “Why would I talk to her? She can’t understand me yet.” is a common response to questions about why they are not interacting with their children. Officials at China’s National Health & Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) have taken note of this issue, and are eager to take action. They have embraced the idea of village-based parenting centers as a way of bringing parental training into the areas most in need of assistance. The NHFPC has already committed both local cadres (i.e. government) and financial resources towards the parenting center project. Now, they have approached a research team to help them identify the best way in which to design and implement the village-based centers. The aim of this study is to identify the best way to develop these village-based parenting centers and measure the impact that these centers have on parental knowledge and behavior and, most importantly, on child development outcomes."
