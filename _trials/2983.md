abstract: "The READS Lab at the Harvard Graduate School of Education will conduct a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) Design to replicate the effects of a Model of Reading Engagement (MORE) on concept knowledge, expository writing, and reading comprehension outcomes for students in Kindergarten, Grade 1, and Grade 2. MORE is a literacy intervention that provides elementary students with (1) access to complex and connected science concepts; (2) comprehension instruction that integrates reading and writing; (3) support for reading at home; and (4) motivational supports.  The SMART trial aims to test whether each of the following levers is more effective: support for deep vs wide reading at home; identification of non-responders at 2 weeks or 4 weeks; additional engagement supports via gamification or gamification and text messaging.
