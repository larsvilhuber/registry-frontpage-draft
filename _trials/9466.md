abstract: "We introduce the COVID-19 safe education framework (C-SEF), a novel mechanism for monitoring and safeguarding a population in educational institutions. The mechanism aims to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 restrictions on economic, psychological and educational well-being, a phenomenon that has been referred to as ‘learning loss’ in other similar instances. We propose a utility-weighted algorithmic approach to pool testing individuals in a scarce-resource setting. The mechanism uses pooled testing to identify healthy individuals, who are permitted to return on-site, while guaranteeing that infected individuals continue to work off-site. The utility-based optimisation approach underlying our solution takes into account factors such as psychological well-being, need for academic resources and socio-economic status in order to optimally allocate testing. To evaluate the efficacy and robustness of our proposed solution, we conduct a randomised controlled
trial at the Potosinian Institute of Scientific and Technological Research (IPICYT). The outcome of our experiment will be measured in terms of performance and productivity, mental health and infection probabilities. Moreover, the evaluation results will allow us to make policy recommendations for better governance of educational institutions during pandemic times."
