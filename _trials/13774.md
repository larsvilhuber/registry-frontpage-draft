abstract: "Once African Americans gained access to public provisions ---such as swimming pools, parks, and desegregated education--- support for these public provisions declined.  A nascent literature argues that racism and a backlash to the civil rights movement also contributed to the decline in the U.S. social safety net. Using two parallel experiments, we study the causal effects of providing information about the number of Black people receiving welfare and unemployment insurance benefits on support for these policies.  We use measures of individual confidence in their pre-treatment beliefs to measure treatment intensity and study the interaction of the treatment with individual-level racial bias, both explicit and implicit. Decreased program support following information that there are more Black recipients than expected (compared to a control) indicates a causal relationship between racism and policy preferences."
