abstract: "Economic studies often use years of schooling or average enrolment rates as measures of education, even though these readily available measures tend to be very noisy and aggregate a variety of distinct elements. However, recently, the focus has shifted towards the direct measurement of cognitive skills â€“ one of the main skills that we aim to teach students in school and university (Finn et al. 2014; Hanushek and Woessman 2008).

Our research project aims to tackle these aforementioned problems in a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). First, we plan to induce random variation in improvements to cognitive and non-cognitive skills by teaching a specifically designed course to university students as part of their education. Our focus will be whether the intervention affects students' political knowledge and voting intentions. We plan to offer undergraduate students a mandatory semester-long course to improve their cognitive skills. We will randomly assign students to one of three experimental groups: (i) a treatment group receiving a cognitive (analytical) skills course, (ii) a second treatment group receiving a non-cognitive (soft) skills course, and (iii) a pure control group. We will measure political behavior using surveys. "
