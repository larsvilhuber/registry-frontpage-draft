abstract: "Use of sachet water (small quantities of drinking-water sold in plastic bags) is growing rapidly in West Africa, yet its health impact remains unmeasured and the appropriate regulatory environment remains ill-defined. This project assesses the feasibility of a possible intervention to reduce childhood diarrhoea through targeted, subsidised sachet water provision.  We will explore practical issues involved in implementing the intervention and measuring changes in childhood diarrhoea incidence as a result of providing subsidised sachet water to households in Accra, Ghana with only intermittent piped water supplies.  The microbiological quality of sachet water in Accra will be tested to determine its safety.  Participating households will receive vouchers to obtain sachets (for free or at a 50% discount) from local water vendors. We shall measure childhood diarrhoea, household drinking-water and sachet use, and vendors’ sachet sales in the pilot to gain insights into how sachet voucher provision affects households and vendors. If feasible, we propose to conduct a larger randomized controlled trial to measure the health impact and cost-effectiveness of providing subsidised sachet water to young children in Accra. In this main trial, by examining differences in diarrhoea rates and growth in children in different study arms, we plan to assess whether greater sachet use as a result of subsidy or free provision protects against water-borne disease and thus contribute to child growth and development. This will allow us to assess whether the costs of sachet water regulation or subsidy are justified by reductions in diarrhoeal disease and child mortality.
