abstract: "The goal of this study is to examine the effects of natural disasters on householdsâ€™ aspirations and livelihood decisions in the context of severe floods in Nigeria. Using survey data from agricultural households in Jigawa State, we compare outcomes the year after severe flooding in 2022 in a random sample of 35 flooded communities against 35 non-flooded communities with similar characteristics and flood risk. In addition, we randomly assign survey respondents within communities to receive either information about local flooding history and predicted flood risk or placebo information. We test impacts of community flooding and the information treatment on measures of household labor supply and livelihoods, beliefs about flood risks, aspirations, and cognitive and psychological outcomes. We use the results to evaluate the contribution of psychological pathways for impacts of natural disasters on labor supply and structural transformation."
