abstract: "How can tolerance and trust be rebuilt after conflict? This study explores the potential for contact with out-groups (“intergroup contact”) to reduce prejudice in a post-conflict setting. Iraqi Christians displaced by ISIS are randomly assigned to an all-Christian soccer team or to a team mixed with Sunni Arabs, who share the same ethno-religious background as ISIS. In the pilot, Christians assigned to mixed teams were 26.1 percentage-points more likely to attend a Ramadan event three weeks after the intervention, 45.5 percentage-points more likely to play soccer with Muslims four months later, and 31 percent more likely to believe that peaceful coexistence is possible. These initial findings suggest that cooperative contact may rebuild social trust over time. This full RCT scales up the pilot, measuring impacts up to one year later on participants’ attitudes and behaviors, as well as that of their households and of the local community at large.
