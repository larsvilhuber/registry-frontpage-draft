abstract: "The purpose of this study is to assess, using a multi-site randomized controlled trial, whether in-class exercises designed based on the "4-S" principles of the team-based learning pedagogy are more effective at developing student learning in college principles of microeconomics classes than traditional principles of microeconomics practice problems in those classes.  Assignment to treatment and control exercises is randomized at the site and module level, so that all students, sites and instructors are exposed to both the treatment and the control.  Effectiveness is measured via a low-stakes end-of-block assessment that is common for each module across all sites."
