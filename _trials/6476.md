abstract: "In this experiment, we develop a non-deceptive methodology to estimate the willingness-to-pay for products whose technology is already functional, but that are not on the market yet. 
We apply this methodology for a specific category of cultured meat, i.e., foie gras.
We elicit French participants' willingness-to-pay for this new product and correlate it with standard demographic variables and attitudes towards meat.
We further elicit participants' beliefs about the probability that they actually receive the cultured-meat product. We derive the appropriate correction of beliefs when participants report their beliefs under uncertainty about the availability of the product. "
