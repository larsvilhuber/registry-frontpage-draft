abstract: "The main objective of this project is to study how the provision of information regarding available alternatives affects the search and application process of parents with and without non assignment risk on school choice platforms. Previous evidence has documented that there exist heterogeneous beliefs about assignment probabilities and these drive choice application behavior Kapor, Neilson and Zimmerman (2020). In addition, Arteaga, Kapor, Neilson and Zimmerman (2021) provides evidence that biased beliefs of assignment probabilities lead applicants to list too few options and that correcting these beliefs leads applicants to expand their list of options suggesting additional search was conducted in the process. Allende et al (2021) shows evidence of limited awareness of the set of potential options and that information provision on the existence and characteristics of nearby options can change applications and assignments. In this study we add to this literature by testing hypotheses regarding whether providing information about available alternatives, and particularly about the demand and risk of these alternatives, improves the search process of parents. These suggestions are a complement to application risk warning previously tested in the literature with promising results. This serves as a test of whether search is “directed” or “random” and specifically if the design of platforms and the information they provide can shift search and choice behavior. These questions are important as they speak to the importance of the design of information provision on choice and search platforms more broadly."
