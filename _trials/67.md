abstract: "Rural grain markets throughout much of the developing world are characterized by large, regular seasonal price fluctuations. Farmer behavior in light of these fluctuations is often puzzling: the vast majority appear to sell their produce when prices are low, buy when prices are high, or often both. This behavior appears to persist despite farmers’ general recognition of these price patterns, and the availability of a simple technology - storage - which can be used to move grain intertemporally.

Why don’t farmers use storage to take better advantage of these seasonal price fluctuations? Working with 1589 smallholder maize farmers and an NGO implementing partner in Webuye District in Western Kenya, we designed and implemented an experiment to test two hypotheses: (1) farmers are liquidity constrained and thus sell their maize at low post-harvest prices because they need the cash, and (2) farmers’ friends and family make frequent claims on stored maize, reducing the incentive to store."
