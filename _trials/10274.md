abstract: "While in Western developed countries people establish a firm link between their beliefs in the importance of merit (as opposed to luck and privilege) in the income generating process and the desired level of redistribution, this significant correlation is not observed in East Asian countries despite a tradition of meritocratic civil service exams with competitive selection and a heavy focus on education. We argue that the concept of meritocracy takes different forms in Asia versus in Europe. We make a distinction between "consequentialist" meritocracy and "deontological" meritocracy, with the former adopting meritocracy as a means of maximising total surplus and the latter aiming at distributing resources proportional to intrinsic merits. We predict that these two types of meritocracy interpretations would generate different distributional preferences, and empirically test it with incentivised spectator games with students from highly selective colleges of different cultures. Spectators are asked to make redistribution choices in a series of scenarios provided to them. We randomize the status-quo income distribution described in the scenarios, by assigning half of the spectators to a highly unequal status-quo distribution (winner takes all) and the other half to an almost equal status-quo distribution. We compare both the sums redistributed and the Gini coefficients implemented by spectators of different cultures, in order to disentangle preference for inequality from status-quo bias. In order to test our predictions of which meritocracy considerations Western (deontological meritocrats) and East Asian (consequentialist meritocrats) respondents would privilege when faced with ethical trade-offs, we compare the redistribution choices made by spectators in a baseline scenario where the initial income distribution is determined by performance on a task, with their redistribution choices in scenarios where ethical trade-offs arise."
