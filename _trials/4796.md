abstract: "The aim of the study is to identify what sender/signal combinations are most persuasive in encouraging low socioeconomic males living in the U.S. to take-up seasonal flu vaccination. We plan to recruit male participants and randomly assign them to four persuasion treatments: three of which vary dimensions of the sender of a medical recommendation (racial concordance, gender concordance, and authority treatments) and one which varies the signal (standard vs. empathetic). Specifically, we will show participants videos of either Black or white actors providing scripted information on the flu vaccination. We will randomize the race of the sender for all participants and also randomize the authority of the sender for Black participants, with the actor portraying either a doctor or a layperson. We may also randomize the gender of the sender for participants assigned to a racially concordant sender. In addition, we will vary the script used in the experiment between one that acknowledges past injustices and one that does not. We will provide participants a free flu shot coupon and elicit the price at which participants would be willing to trade in the coupon for a cash reward. Lastly, in light of the relevance of vaccination take-up in combating COVID-19 pandemic, we will assess demand for information about a COVID-19 vaccine, with subjects invited to receive results of a safety and efficacy review from a trusted or standard source. The design requires collection of baseline and endline surveys combined with administrative data from pharmacies about coupon redemption. The primary outcomes of interest are posterior beliefs about seasonal flu, demand and WTP for a free flu shot coupon, redemption of the coupon, and demand for information about a COVID-19 vaccine."
