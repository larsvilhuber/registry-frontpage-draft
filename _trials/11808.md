abstract: "Stereotypical beliefs about individual skills and traits can have substantial implications for hiring decisions, which subsequently translate into economic externalities. While existing literature provides evidence of racial and gender differences in traits like competitiveness and overconfidence, limited research has been conducted to understand how these traits are perceived across different racial and gender groups.  This study aims to bridge this gap by investigating beliefs about racial and gender differences in these traits and their relationship with beliefs about earnings and performance, as well as examining their relation to decision-making within a hiring context. The research also investigates the role of a candidate's competitiveness and the ambiguity of their competition choices, with a focus on variations across race and gender. Data for this research will be collected from a stratified sample of 3,600 U.S. residents, aged between 25 and 65, spanning six racial-ethnic-gender (REG) groups. By studying these perceptions and their impact on hiring decisions, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of stereotypical beliefs in the labor market and to offer valuable insights for addressing discriminatory practices."
