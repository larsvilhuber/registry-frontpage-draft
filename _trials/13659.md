abstract: "Much research has emphasized the disproportionate impact of the opioid crisis on White individuals in the United States, especially during the first wave.  This project considers whether this framing has affected the response to the opioid crisis.  In this experiment, we will randomize racial priming in a survey to understand whether it affects stated support for the policy response to the opioid epidemic.  We will include a description of the opioid crisis in terms of overdose deaths.  In one arm, we will not mention race.  In the first treatment arm, we will highlight that most overdose deaths are among White individuals.  In the second treatment arm, we will highlight the disproportionately high overdose death rates of Black and American Indian/Alaska Native individuals.  We will compare whether this priming affects whether the respondent believes that we dedicate "too much" attention and policy spending on the opioid crisis.  We will also include subsequent questions about willingness-to-pay for policies to decrease overdose deaths, whether opioid addiction is a choice, and other questions about possible policy options.
