abstract: "There is some evidence that political attitudes are related to how individuals update their beliefs. This study will first test for such relationships, and then go on to try to identify key causal factors such as self-deception, dogmatism and status quo bias. Political stance will be measured using a multi-dimensional scale together with a simpler measure of political attitude. A number of scales and measures will be included that are novel to economics (though known to psychologists) in an effort to disentangle the many possible causes of any relationship between political attitudes and belief-updating."
