abstract: "This pre-analysis plan outlines a study on the role of self-preserving redistribution across 40 countries. Self-preserving redistribution is defined as redistribution motivated by individuals' beliefs that such actions will benefit their own self-centered interests indirectly. The study hypothesizes that the extent of this redistribution is influenced by individuals' inequality externality beliefs—the idea that inequality itself leads to negative societal outcomes. An experimental game will be conducted with 40,000 participants to explore these dynamics. The experimental design aims to isolate self-preserving motives from altruistic ones and assess how inequality beliefs impact redistributive behaviors. The results are expected to provide insights into the prevalence and drivers of self-preserving redistribution and its potential impact on global redistributive policies. "
