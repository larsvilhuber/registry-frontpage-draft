abstract: "In a post-COVID-19 world, in which societies are moving to promote the recovery of learning lost during the pandemic crisis, it becomes increasingly critical to find efficient and cost-effective ways to invest in education systems. Not only that, but the reduced attention given to COVID-19, regardless of its lingering effects, also precipitates a continuous push to fight against these deficits. It is both in this setting, in an acknowledgement of the current length of summer schools in the Flemish region of Belgium, and in a context of strengthened interest in summer schools by the government of Flanders that we implemented our Randomized Control Trial. This research project aims at understanding how a behavioral nudge can help more disadvantaged students to want to participate in Summer Schools, so as to promote the compensation for the learning losses associated with both summer breaks and COVID-19. For this purpose, we intend to use tailored tests and informational prompts with images, presented to primary school students in the Flemish region of Belgium, such that one group is exposed to no information, another with topics on the benefits of school, another on summer schools, a fourth group on a mix of the last two topics, and a fifth on information about how school can help them improve their socio-emotional state. Hence, we can determine the effect of the additional information on their intention to attend summer school, while controlling for cognitive ability through tailored testing before and after the video. Moreover, we can use information provided by participants to detect students coming from more disadvantaged background in order to explore how our prompts and images have impacted these individuals in particular. Simultaneously, using a similar approach, we intend to assess how students' opinions about school can bias their wish to attend summer schools, and how providing them with information contradictory to their beliefs about school can compensate for the effect of this possible bias, as well as perform test for susceptibility of displaying Anchoring Bias (based on definition by Tversky and Kahneman, 1974) in their decision making. This analysis will be done together with an analysis of data about the results of large online campaigns to promote summer schools. This project will provide valuable information concerning the effect of information distribution on the intention to attend summer schools, behavioral biases, as well as a cost-effectiveness analysis of summer schools and their marketing materials so that policymakers can make better education policies."
