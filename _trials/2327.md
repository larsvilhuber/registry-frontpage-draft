abstract: "Youth employment is a burning issue in Africa. With low levels of formal education and a very narrow formal sector, promoting productive self-employment is critical. Several constraints hinder the creation and development of successful businesses, including the lack of management skills and the lack of startup capital. In Benin, the Government is investing 0.5% of GDP into a national Youth employment program aimed at addressing those constraints. The proposed evaluation will use an RCT to study the relative impacts of providing basic business training, providing start-up capital, or providing both, on employment outcomes for youth as measured 12 and 24 months after the program. Particular emphasis will be put on the analysis of gender-differentiated impacts, with adequate sample sizes and dedicated survey measures.
