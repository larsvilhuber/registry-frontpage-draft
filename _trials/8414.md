abstract: "Despite gender convergence in many areas of the labor market, men and women still work in markedly different occupations. In this paper, I aim to understand whether preferences over the gender composition of oneâ€™s occupation can explain continuing occupational gender segregation. To assess the willingness to pay for gender composition of a job, I run a survey in which respondents choose between multiple hypothetical jobs characterized by pay, tasks, and demographics. I then pair the survey results with a structural model to assess the welfare effects of policies that could re-allocate workers across occupations by gender.
