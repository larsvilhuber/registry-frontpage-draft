abstract: "The idea that many poor individuals are significantly present-biased has led to a proliferation of recent development interventions with commitment features, in particular commitment savings products (Ashraf, Karlan & Yin, 2006; John, 2015). Yet if individuals integrate background income into experimental decisions over time-dated monetary payments, then apparent measurement of ``present-bias'' may in fact reflect individuals' (correct or incorrect) anticipation that they will be less liquidity-constrained in the future. To experimentally test this hypothesis among a population which has been explicitly targeted for commitment products, I conduct a field experiment with female clients of a microfinance organisation in Pakistan. I randomly vary the timing of survey participation fees in order to induce exogenous variation in these individualsâ€™ liquidity constraints, and examine whether and how this impacts individuals' measured rate of time preference and time-consistency.
