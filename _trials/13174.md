abstract: "This study aims to investigate the impact of shareholder engagement as a tool for sustainable investment, with a focus on the threat of voting. Specifically, a field experiment will be conducted to examine whether a minority shareholder's threat to vote against the TCFD report increases board-level accountability for sustainability. The aim is to offer concrete evidence on how investors can catalyze change and underscore the significance of a credible threat in engaging with companies on sustainability matters."
