abstract: "Low adoption of productivity-enhancing technologies and practices continues to be the main barrier to increasing yields among smallholder farmers in Ethiopia. Many socioeconomic and behavioral factors contribute to the low adoption of modern inputs and production methods including limited access to inputs, liquidity and credit constraints, risks and uncertainty, information asymmetry, and present-biased behavior, among others. In this study, we evaluate a project that aims to improve the productivity and income of smallholder coffee and maize farmers in Jimma zone by addressing multiple technology adoption constraints. The evaluation mainly rely on a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the causal effect of the interventions on the adoption of good agricultural practices, productivity, and income. The evaluation will also assess potential synergies between the interventions, provide insights into the pathways that help explain the realized impacts, and potential heterogeneity of impacts along economic and social dimensions.."
