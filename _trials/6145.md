abstract: "There is an ongoing debate in the literature about whether imperfect information affects consumers' investment efficiency. We experimentally evaluate the role of imperfect information or limited attention about energy costs in households' choices of home appliances and light bulbs. Using in-home visits, we collect detailed information on the energy efficiency of the participants' current energy-consuming household durables. Our intervention exploits these unique data to provide treated households with customized information about the potential of monetary savings from the adoption of new, comparable and efficient, durables.
We find a substantial information treatment effect on both the energy efficiency of the newly purchased durables and the intensity of utilization of current home appliances. Further, the results show that households respond to the customized intervention more when, ex-ante, there is greater potential of savings, and that the information treatment induced the purchase of appliances with lower total lifetime costs. These findings suggest that individuals are not fully informed about or pay attention to energy costs when purchasing and utilizing energy-consuming household durables, and have important policy implications."
