abstract: "This study aims to estimate job seekers' willingness to pay for job flexibility using a discrete choice experiment approach. This study is coordinated with a company and a job search board in China. In order to investigate the potential influence of Covid and/or the zero-Covid policy implemented by Chinese government, we plan to conduct two waves of experiments, one during the Covid period and one after the giving up of zero-Covid policy.
