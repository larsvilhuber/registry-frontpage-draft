abstract: "The rise of social media has coincided with growing mental health challenges, including depression, anxiety, and eating disorders, especially among girls and young women. This project investigates how the type of content an individual is exposed to on social media influences their body image and economic decisions. We conduct an online field experiment on TikTok in which young female TikTok users are randomly assigned to view content featuring creators of certain body sizes. We will test how being exposed to creators of various body sizes affects their (1) social media use, (2) beauty standards, (3) well-being, and (4) attitudes and behaviors towards others. "
