abstract: "The ‘Crescer Sem Violência’ / ‘Growing Up Without Violence’ (CSV) curricula aims to reduce children’s vulnerability to commercial sexual exploitation as well as improve school staff’s ability to identify and respond to case of abuse. The CSV curricula centres on three film series that introduce concepts such as bodily autonomy, sexual abuse and commercial sexual exploitation. The shows—‘What is this exploitation’, ‘What is this abuse’ & ‘What body is this’—were developed in consultation with child rights professionals. The films invite debate around sexual rights and self-protection. The intervention is delivered through adult facilitators, who receive training through in-person workshops and online courses. 

The evaluation is a two-arms parallel-group Randomised Control Trial (RCT) of a school-based complex social intervention to prevent sexual exploitation of children and adolescents. The unit of randomisation for the RCT are public schools in two municipalities within the Recife Metropolitan Region. Out of the eligible schools who sign up for the intervention, 60 schools will be randomised to two parallel arms (30 in the intervention arm, and 30 in the control arm). Stratified randomisation, based on a composite measure including level of poverty and criminality in the schools’ neighbourhood and school performance, will be used to allocate schools to the study arms in a 1:1 ratio. Schools in the intervention arm will receive the CSV intervention during the school year, starting after the baseline survey. Data will be collected from a cross-section of students at baseline and at endline, with roughly 6 months in between when the CSV curriculum will be delivered. We will examine associations between aspects of programme implementation and outcomes, and the causal pathways leading to changes in adolescents’ attitudes and behaviours."
