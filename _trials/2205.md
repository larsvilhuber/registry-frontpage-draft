abstract: "In explaining the high rates of startup failures, the entrepreneurship literature has emphasized several factors, such as the size and characteristics of the founding team or the technology. This study focuses instead on the role of entrepreneurial decision-making, whose importance in affecting new venture performance has become increasingly important in entrepreneurship and strategic management research and practice. Our randomized controlled trial tests if, to what extent and under which conditions the adoption of a scientific approach to entrepreneurial decision making improves performance. By scientific approach to entrepreneurial decision making we mean that entrepreneurs should behave like scientists, accurately framing and identifying the problem they wish to address, articulating theories, defining clear hypotheses, conducting rigorous tests to prove or disprove these hypotheses, measuring the results of the tests, and making decisions based on these tools.
Building on a pilot study (RCT) conducted  at Bocconi University involving 116 Italian founders of new startups we are conducting another RCT on 265 startups to identify the mechanisms that explain why a scientific approach to entrepreneurial decision making affects firm performance. We argue that entrepreneurial decision-making can benefit from the use of a scientific approach because entrepreneurs can recognize when their projects exhibit low or high returns, or when it is profitable to pivot to alternative ideas. In other words, entrepreneurs with thoroughly thought-through, validated “theories” of their business and hypotheses of what customers want that are soundly tested through experiments, are better able to mitigate their biases when they analyze market signals, reducing the likelihood of incurring in false positives and false negatives.
