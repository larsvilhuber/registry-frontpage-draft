abstract: "We randomly assign the investigations of 66% of the 1,683 homicides occurring in Bogota, Colombia, during 2016 to a new procedure in which teams of responsible functionaries are in charge of a given case throughout the investigation process. We find a statistically significant 30% increase in the conviction rate in the treatment group relative to the control group. Indicators of the quality of the investigative process also improve, as well as the rate at which a formal accusation is presented before a court. Complementary findings suggest that the team work induced by the treatment improves communication, coordination, feedback, and motivation."
