abstract: "Modern Western societies are challenged by the health risks resulting from poor nutritional behavior. The societal costs of malnutrition are enormous; billions of dollars are spent on direct medical costs for curing physical and mental diseases. The amount attributable to indirect costs, such as deteriorated labor market outcomes, are staggering. Stress-induced dietary choices, characterized by heightened appetite and cravings for high-fat and high-sugar comfort foods, contribute significantly to poor nutrition. Consequently, mitigating stress can potentially enhance the quality of dietary choices.
This research investigates whether mindfulness practices, including breathing techniques and meditation, can influence stress levels and lead to improved food choices. In a laboratory-environment 3-armed randomized controlled trial, we assess the two treatment groups’ responses to meditation by measuring participants’ physiological and perceived stress levels before and after the meditation treatment over a 4-week intervention. Participants’ in an active control group also provides physiological and perceived stress levels before and after interventions over the 4-week period. Real food choices and stated food consumption of both treatment groups and the control group are recorded to investigate the effect of stress and meditation on food decision making.
