abstract: "This research project aims to understand how gender differences in business relationships can lead to gender differences in business outcomes. First, we will conduct a large-scale survey of agribusinesses in Ghana to document (i) the role of gender in business partnerships and (ii) gender differences in preferences for business collaborations on a supplier-matching platform. We will implement a modified version of the Incentivized Resume Rating (IRR) design. To implement this analysis, we will collaborate with the National Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme (NEIP) to offer a matching service where entrepreneurs in agribusinesses who are interested in finding new suppliers or buyers will be invited to participate.
