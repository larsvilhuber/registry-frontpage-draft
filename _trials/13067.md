abstract: "More than half of children in Indonesia experienced learning poverty and their literacy skills have been declining since the COVID-19 pandemic hit. To overcome learning loss, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology (MoECRT) launched the “Quality Reading Books” program to enhance student's literacy by fostering a greater interest in reading. The intervention targets primary schools and consists of three components: the provision of a package of 600 storybooks tailored to students’ different reading levels, a centralized training session for four days for teachers to better support students in cultivating reading habits, and the facilitation of learning groups across participating schools. The program has been implemented in primary schools with the lowest literacy level based on the national assessment (level 1 schools), reaching more than fourteen thousand school beneficiaries in its first batch from 2022 to 2023. Before expanding the program to all primary schools, this study evaluates its impact on schools that fall into the next lowest level literacy level (level 2 schools).

This research aims to evaluate the impact of the “Quality Reading Books” program on students’ reading habits, literacy skills, and teachers’ practices at school. We are conducting a randomized evaluation involving about 1,000 low-performing (level 2) primary schools across 36 districts in 10 provinces in Indonesia. To measure the impact on student literacy, we will utilize the literacy component of the national assessment, which is administered annually to grade 5 students, both before and after the program's implementation. Additionally, we will conduct a complementary phone baseline and endline survey to assess book availability and usage in a subset of 440 schools and carry out qualitative research in 20 treatment schools. We also plan to include questions on reading habits in the 2024 and 2025 national assessments. The findings will provide evidence on the effectiveness of promoting storybook reading in schools to improve the reading habits and literacy of primary school students. "
