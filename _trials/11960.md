abstract: "Bad air quality is a significant problem for children, as it can cause various clinical and subclinical problems, including respiratory infections, asthma, allergies, absenteeism, and cognitive impairment. In this registered report, we present the design of a \textit{cluster randomized control trial} on the potential benefits (and cost-effectiveness) of installing air purifiers in schools to reduce children's exposure to poor air quality conditions. We randomly assign 95 classes in three schools to receive or not air purifiers and estimate their effects on indoor air pollution, absenteeism, achievement, cognitive ability, and behavioral outcomes related to mood and aggression. We expect to find a relevant increase in school attendance, learning, cognitive outcomes, and the general well-being of children. The results of this study would allow policymakers to understand the benefits of a scalable defensive strategy to mitigate the exposure of vulnerable groups to a relevant environmental stressor."
