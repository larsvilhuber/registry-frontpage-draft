abstract: "We compare performance of different mechanisms corresponding to anonymous social choice functions. Since there is no efficient dominant strategy mechanism, we aim at improving the efficiency by relaxing the dominance constraint. We replace the dominant strategy solution concept with behavioral but still relatively simple solution concepts. We show theoretically that this replacement allows us to gain improvement in efficiency. However, the empirical relevance of these concepts is still in question. Thus we test the theoretical predictions in the lab."
