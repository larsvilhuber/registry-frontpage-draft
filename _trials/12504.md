abstract: "This study follows up on a study we just conducted during the 1st round of Argentina Presidential Election on October 22, 2023, which was called "Fighting Populist Misinformation with a Leaflet Campaign". The purpose of the present study is twofold. First, given that Javier Milei made it (together with Sergio Massa) to the 2nd round of the election, this gives us a unique opportunity (rarely available in information treatment experiments as such opportunities are usually unique) to replicate the earlier experiment and check whether it replicates. Second, the preliminary data from the first experiment suggest quite strong network effects - which we thought were likely and planned to measure (and preregistered). Given that, we use the 2nd round as an opportunity to more clearly decompose direct effects from indirect (network) effects. We therefore work with the NGO to send leaflets to a subsample of voters who are supporters of the PJ party and who were in "pure control" departments in the previous ones and were therefore unaffected by our earlier work. These leaflets would provide information about Milei's policy proposals and their consequences. We will then use the official election data (precinct ("mesa")-level) to measure both the direct effect of our campaign on treated voters and the voters treated indirectly through informational spillover / network effects, with the exact proposal for measurement in the pre-analysis plan."
