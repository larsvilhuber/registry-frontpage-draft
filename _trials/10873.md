abstract: "The quality of education remains a stumbling block for Indian schoolchildren. According to the 2018 Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), which assesses a representative sample of students in every district in India, only 27% of children in grade 3 and 50% of children in grade 5 can read at the grade 2-level. 72% of children in grade 5 are unable to complete a subtraction problem from the grade 2 curriculum.

Educate Girls seeks to address educational quality and inequities by recruiting and managing a large staff of field coordinators and a network of community-based volunteers to deliver their programming to tens of thousands of the poorest and most remote villages in India. Educate Girls’ core program involves in-school remedial instruction in reading, math, and English to students in grades 3 to 5 in government primary schools. From 2015 to 2018, Educate Girls participated in a clustered randomized controlled trial of their in-school program across 332 schools, which found that Educate Girls’ program had large positive effects on learning outcomes.

Educate Girls has received funding to scale up their program to 35,000 villages over five years. This evaluation will assess whether Educate Girls can maintain high levels of impact at a much larger scale than was previously assessed. We will conduct a clustered randomized controlled trial from 2022 to 2024 in a sample of 267 expansion villages. Children will be sampled at baseline and assessed after one-year and two-years in basic literacy and math skills.

As of this registration, randomization and baseline data collection have been completed. No outcome data has been collected."
