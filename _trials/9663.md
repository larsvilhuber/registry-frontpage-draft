abstract: "This study explores human perceptions of algorithms in HR context. This study follows our previous experiments on people's perception of efficiency vs. fairness tradeoff in personnel selection (AEARCTR-0008804). Here, we modify the scenario and focus on female dominated occupation to investigate how the degree of efficiency vs. fairness tradeoff affects people' choices of the algorithms and their fairness perceptions.
