abstract: "When we ask someone to predict their future choices or behavior, we are implicitly asking them to predict the likelihood of future states of the world, to predict their behavior (based off their preferences) in each of these states, and then to aggregate all this information into a final prediction. Each "step" in this mental process could be prone to biases or error, leading to misprediction of future behavior. In this study, we seek to decompose and quantify how much of a role each of these "steps" plays in misprediction and explore mechanisms for why people make mistakes in each "step." We also seek to document whether this decomposition changes over time, as we give people opportunities to learn. 

Specifically, we will run a 5-session modification of the survey-based experiment from Augenblick and Rabin (2019), adding uncertainty about the sentence length of a Greek transcription task (i.e., how much time/effort a task takes). We give respondents information about the sentence length distribution and ask them to predict this distribution. We also ask them to predict their future work choices both unconditionally and conditional on being assigned specific sentence lengths. We explore several misprediction mechanisms: present-focus, motivated beliefs, non-Bayesian updating, and cognitive mistakes due to complexity."
