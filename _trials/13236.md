abstract: "This entry covers the evaluation of the impact of Livelihood (LH) interventions in the context of Ethiopiaâ€™s rural Productive Safety Net Project (PSNP) using a nationwide clustered randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate. This economic inclusion (EI) program provides livelihood services to a subset of PSNP public work households. It complements the transfers received as remuneration for the participation in public works by a sequenced package of training and coaching as well as a livelihood grant or facilitated access to subsidized credit. This evaluation will estimate the direct impact of the interventions on beneficiaries and will examine who benefits the most from them. It will investigate the value-added of additional government implemented life-skills training. Finally, it will study the indirect (spillover) effects of these interventions on the local economy."
