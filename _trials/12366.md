abstract: "Purpose: Caregivers of individuals diagnosed with dementia frequently report elevated levels of anxiety, depression, burdens associated with caregiving, and existential suffering. However, individuals who receive adequate support and employ effective coping strategies tend to experience lower levels of distress and caregiving burden. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is designed to promote increased acceptance of internal experiences while encouraging actions aligned with one's personal values to enhance psychological flexibility. The primary objective of this single-arm pilot study was to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of an online ACT intervention (OACTICs) on various aspects of well-being among caregivers dealing with dementia.
Methods: The caregiver must be ≥ 21 years of age (i.e., a parent, spouse, partner, sibling, or adult child), or they must be the primary caregiver of the person with dementia for ≥12 months and have scores that indicate moderate or higher on the scale of anxiety, depression, and poor quality of life. Participants received an online-based ACT over six weekly 1-hour sessions. The following outcome measures were administered at baseline (T1), immediately post-intervention (T2), and 3 months follow-up (T3): Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Zarit Burden Interview, The Experience of Suffering Measure, and Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II
Finding: All 45 participants completed the study, and 93.3% rated their overall satisfaction with their OACTICs experience as “completely satisfied”.
Originality: OACTICs is a cost-effective and time-efficient treatment approach that enhances the psychological well-being of caregivers of dementia. Furthermore, this is a novel study conducted in Pakistan for this population.
