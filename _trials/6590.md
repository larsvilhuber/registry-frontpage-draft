abstract: "We investigate the effect of a pension app on voluntary savings for retirement. Individuals insured in two pension funds in Switzerland will receive a letter nudging them to register to the pension funds' digital information application. We aim to learn what factors determine the demand for pension-related information and what are the barriers to voluntary savings for retirement. The pension funds will send out three versions of the invitation letter to individuals who are not yet registered in the pension app: a baseline version with generic information about the application, a version highlighting that the pension app alllows to calculate tax benefits, and a version stressing the simplified application process for voluntary savings with the application. A fourth group will not receive an invitation letter and acts as the control group. We evaluate first, whether the letters have an effect on the probability to register within the application and, second, whether using the application impacts voluntary saving decisions of the insured individuals.
