abstract: "This study aims to provide new causal evidence on the prejudices faced by immigrant students and solutions to mitigate them. Segregation and discriminatory attitudes represent a major barrier to immigrant children integration. While teachers’ negative stereotypes can have permanent adverse consequences on children’s human capital accumulation, relatively little is known about how to reduce and prevent such biases. We focus on Ecuador, a country that has received unprecedented large inflows of Venezuelan immigrants over the past five years. Using administrative data of end-of-term exam grades as well as objective performance measures from standardized test scores, we evaluate the impact of two interventions directed to school teachers: first, a short video that reveals information on equal performance and ambitions of natives and immigrant students, second, we provide personalized feedback on own implicit biases using an Implicit Association Test. The study will constitute one of the first interventions in the region to reduce bias against immigrant students."
