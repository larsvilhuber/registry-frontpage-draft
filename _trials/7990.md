abstract: "Mortgage rates have decreased considerably in Chile over the past decade, but mortgage holders rarely refinance their loans.  The Chilean National Consumer Service (SERNAC) is the agency of the State of Chile in charge of ensuring the protection of the rights of consumers. SERNAC has been considering using informational treatments to encourage consumers to refinance.  However, the type of informational treatment that would be most effective would depend on the nature of the friction preventing consumers from refinancing.  First, search may be costly: it may take substantial effort for a consumer to go from bank to bank soliciting offers.  Second, switching may be costly: not only might it take mental effort to even start the process of searching for a loan (perhaps because the consumer is unaware even how to) but changing banks from one's home bank could require substantial effort.  Third, consumers may have incorrect beliefs over the benefits of refinancing: they may be unaware of the prevailing interest rate in the market, for instance.  Broadly, this project asks whether informational treatments can increase the prevalence of refinancing, and if so, what the behavioral frictions are that led to the low likelihood of refinancing.

To answer this question, we partner with a major national bank in Chile.  We conduct three pieces of analysis.  First, we conduct a survey of bank clients to solicit information about clients' understanding of the refinancing process, how they evaluate loans, and their beliefs over market rates.  Second, we conduct a field experiment in which we distribute information about their current loan, the refinancing process, and the market rates to all mortgage holders with the Bank.  This consists of approximately 250,000 clients.  We randomize the clients into five treatment arms, each giving information about a different part of the process.  Finally, we analyze the behavior post-treatment through the lens of a structural model to quantify the behavioral frictions."
