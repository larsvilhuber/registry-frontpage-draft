abstract: "This project studies the effects of the provision of information on degree-specific costs and labor market outcomes on college choice, college persistence, and labor market outcomes.  Collaborating with the Chilean Ministry of Education, we conduct a large-scale informational intervention in which we provide institution and major- (henceforth degree-) specific data on tuition costs and labor market outcomes for past graduates of degree programs to applicants for federal student aid who are considering applying to those programs. We track students' enrollment decisions to determine how the intervention affected matriculation choices. Over the long run, we will consider the effects of our intervention on college persistence and labor market success as well. We frame our results using a simple model of choice under uncertainty, and pay special attention to differential effects by student socioeconomic status, preferences and beliefs elicited in our short baseline survey, and loan access.
