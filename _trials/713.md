abstract: "The success of interventions aiming to encourage pro-social behavior is often measured by how the interventions affect behavior rather than how they affect welfare. We implement a natural field experiment to measure the welfare effects of one especially policy-relevant intervention, home energy conservation reports. We measure consumer surplus by sending consumers introductory reports and using an incentive compatible multiple price list survey to elicit willingness-to-pay to continue the program. The experimental design also allows us to estimate negative willingness-to-pay and address non-response bias. The results underscore that the welfare effects of non-price "nudge" interventions can be measured, and policy makers should strongly consider the welfare effects of such interventions, not just their effects on behavior."
