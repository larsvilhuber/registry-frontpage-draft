abstract: "We design a field experiment to evaluate the role of matching frictions in the labour market integration of refugees. During CV writing sessions with refugees in Munich, we collect information from around 500 refugees that recently arrived in Munich and have a work permit. All of our participants receive a complete CV in German. We then randomly allocate half of the refugees to the treatment group, which is added to the database of an NGO that matches job candidates to suitable employers. This treatment can isolate the effect of matching and information frictions, while it has no effect on the underlying skill set of refugees. The experimental setting allows to track both control and treatment groups over time. Our survey data includes new information on the background characteristics of refugees, their existing job-search strategies, and perceptions of integration.
