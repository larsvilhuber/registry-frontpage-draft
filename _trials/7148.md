abstract: "It is commonly claimed that naturalization has positive impacts for immigrants, but it has been challenging to empirically measure these effects  due to issues of self-selection. We will quantify the effects of access to naturalization through an experimental study of a public-private program organized by the New York State Office for New Americans (ONA) that helped low-income immigrants to naturalize. Eligible immigrants in New York could register to enter a lottery to win a voucher that would pay their naturalization fee. We will use follow-up surveys to measure the effect that access to citizenship has had on integration and health. The results will be disseminated in studies focusing on the various outcomes specified below. "
