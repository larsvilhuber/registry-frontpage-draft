abstract: "Results-based financing (RBF) programs for health in low and middle-income countries often offer financial incentives to health care providers or workers to increase the quantity of a selected set of health care services and/or quality measures.  PBF programs can induce behavioral responses in several ways, e.g., by communicating what services are considered “priority” and/or by the financial incentives attached to the included measures.

We survey health workers in Nigeria to examine whether they know about and understand an ongoing RBF program.  We use an incentivized experiment to examine health workers’ response to the information and the financial incentives (rewards or penalties) implicit in RBF programs.  Specifically, health workers are asked to read several partograph cases and to determine the correct actions to be taken based on this information.  Within a clinic, we randomize workers into three study arms: (a) information-only; (b) information with rewards for specific activities; and (c) information with penalties for not doing specific activities.  We compare health worker performance in each of these three study arms.  We also examine whether performance is better for items that are included in the list, carry any financial incentive, and the value of the reward or penalty."
