abstract: "Women continue to struggle to have strong job market attachment in many countries in the developing world due to challenges in managing the transitions related to major events in their life cycle. Women are more likely than men to exit the labor market due to their domestic and caregiving responsibilities. 

We postulate that the most persistent barriers preventing women to re-enter the workforce after being away for a period of time are in the forms of: 1) skills mismatch, 2) information and search frictions, and 3) childcare duties. 

The proposed pilot interventions include a treatment arm providing face-to-face motivational session coupled with job search training using online job portal and provision of online training vouchers, which are expected to enhance womenâ€™s labor potential and work readiness. In our second treatment arm, we bundle the intervention with information on cost of childcare options in the surrounding neighborhood, for the women to make informed decisions on the cost associated with their decision to return to the workforce."
