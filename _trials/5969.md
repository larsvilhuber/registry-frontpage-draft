abstract: "We investigate whether free provision of drinking water treatment solution through an approach designed to incorporate insights from behavioral economics can cost effectively improve child survival. While few households in low-income countries purchase water treatment solution, Kremer et al. (2011) find that approximately half of households use a free point-of-collection water treatment dispenser designed to be convenient, salient, and public. However, Ashraf et al (2009) argue that free provision may lead to waste; Schmidt and Cairncross (2009) argue that positive impacts of water treatment on caregiver reports of child diarrhea may be subject to reporting bias and call for data on objective outcomes; and recent studies yield little evidence of child development outcomes (Stewart et al. 2018. Our study exploits the random variation in chlorine solution availability induced by the Kenya WASH Benefits study (Null et al., 2018), and uses supplementary survey data recently collected from the study areas (Haushofer et al., 2018). We study the impact of free community-wide provision of dilute chlorine solution on all-cause under 5 mortality over a 4-year period and across a sample of children over twice as large as previously analyzed (Null et al., 2018)."
