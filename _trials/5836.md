abstract: "Research indicates that recalling previous successes cause an increase in motivation and job satisfaction. However, little is known about the specific character of these successes. Drawing on different streams of theories from the field of motivation research, the study examines how recalling different types of success stories from one's work life can affect one's job satisfaction and turnover intention. 

The study is designed as a randomized survey experiment using different vignettes asking the respondents to recall different types of success stories. The respondents comprise a sample of Danish case workers. "
