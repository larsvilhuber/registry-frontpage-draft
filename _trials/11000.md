abstract: "We study an intervention against sexual harassment that provides information on attitudes and job performance. We randomize the intervention across small rooms with military recruits in the boot camp of the Norwegian military. Outcome variables include sexual harassment prevalence and attitudes toward voicing disagreement with harassment when it occurs. An extended analysis studies attrition from the training to understand if our interventions can prevent occupational exit among women.

Contribution: Sexual harassment is a severe and prevalent workplace hazard. It is discrimination by law and a form of violence against women. Previous evaluations of the most common prevention policies have shown a lack of efficiency or even counterproductive results. We suggest a new prevention method and test its efficiency with randomized control trials. This produces new actionable knowledge for sexual harassment prevention.
