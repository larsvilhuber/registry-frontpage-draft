abstract: "Quotas are often discussed as an engineering tool to combat discrimination in hiring decisions. Their effects within competitive labor markets, however, are not well understood yet. Indeed if quotas for promotions are enforced, a promotion can be a signal of lower ability
for those who are discriminated and can lead to lower wage offers on the labor market. On the one side this might harm those who have high ability and who would have received higher wage offers without quotas. On the other side this might also harm those with low ability, since not having been promoted even though the quota was in place is a very bad signal. We aim to investigate the behavioral effects of these mechanisms. We experimentally investigate the effect of quotas in a competitive labor market. Our setting is based on a model by Waldman (1984) which has been extended to explain discrimination and study quotas by G端rtler and G端rtler (2019). Three employers compete for six employees after promotion signals have been revealed to the market. In a baseline treatment employers and employees belong to the same group. In this setting no discrimination regarding promotions is expected. In a second treatment two groups are induced and endogenous statistical discrimination should occur, i.e., different equilibria should be selected. In a third treatment quotas are added."
