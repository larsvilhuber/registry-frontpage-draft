abstract: "We develop an experiment designed to shed light on the role of meditation in influencing the role of four behavioural biases often studied in economics: identity priming; self-control problems; heuristic biases; and egocentric biases (distorted beliefs about self/others). However, different types of meditation may affect behaviour in different ways through a differential impact on issues like attention; body awareness; emotion regulation; and self-perspective. We formulated an RCT design with interventions that target these biases, with a particular focus on attention and self-perspective. Our RCT design will make use of two treatments (sessions that promote mindfulness) and an active control (sessions devoted to general stress management) to analyse the differential effects of attention/insight meditations on the four domains of decision-making (measured using experimental methods in seperate laboratory sessions)."
