abstract: "This study explores whether the existence of opportunities to extract personal rents in a job affects the number and type of individuals who are attracted to it. This question is especially relevant for recruitment and personnel policies in sectors where positions have -or are perceived to have- some discretion to obtain personal rents (i.e. public sector in developing countries). The central concern we address is that the availability of such rents may affect the pool of applicants to such positions towards the more dishonest."
