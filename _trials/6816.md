abstract: "Over the past decade, Nigeria have been terrorised by Boko Haram whose activities according to the UNHCR (2020) has led to the displacement of approximately 2.4 million people in the Lake Chad Basin and over 2 million internally displaced persons in Nigeria. The religious and politically driven ideologies of Boko Haram have also served to exacerbate the conflict especially among the Christians and Muslims. Central to these concerns is the fact that most of the terrorist convicted in Nigeria under the Terrorism Prevention Amendment Act 2013 are been released following the completion of their sentence. A recent systematic review suggest that the Nigerian communities are sceptical of existing reintegration interventions and the acceptance of repentant terrorist combatants back into society (Ike, et al, 2020).  The effect of which might have an impact on the repentant combatantsâ€™ recidivism. We aim to test randomisation procedure concerning whether the use of faith-based intervention drawn from the Christian and Muslim communities in Abuja, Plateau and Delta States may help improve community attitudes towards reintegration. We also aim to determine the acceptability of the procedure and to select the most appropriate primary outcome measure(s)."
