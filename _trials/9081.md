abstract: "This study examines how reference points influence the value for hybrid maize seed and whether such valuing could (partly) explain the disparity between the market price and the willingness to pay for the seed pack. We assess how expectation-based and endowment-based reference points influence willingness to pay for seed. We test how price and ownership expectations affect the monetary value of seed through (modified) BDM auctions. We vary the probability of ownership and price by creating a high and a low probability version. We test the endowment effect by comparing willingness to pay for the seed pack and willingness to accept for giving up the seed pack."
