abstract: "In this trial, we investigate the mechanism that drive public opinion on university tuition fees. Specifically, we examine how perceptions about unequal access to university education and perceptions about a fair burden sharing of study costs drive public support for university tuition fees.  To examine our research question, we designed a survey experiment where randomly selected subgroups of the German population receive an information treatment, relative to university tuition fees, to update their knowledge and subsequent preferences for policy changes.
The first information treatment informs respondents that a student’s likelihood of going to university highly depends on his or her parents’ education.  The second information treatment confronts respondents with the argument that tax-financed university education paired with a skewed distribution of students’ parental background towards better-educated families leads to an unjust burden sharing of study costs. The goal of our survey experiment is to examine if learning about unequal access to university education or undesired redistributive impacts of current university financing changes public opinion on university tuition fees. We are particularly interested in examining the interaction effect of these two information treatments."
