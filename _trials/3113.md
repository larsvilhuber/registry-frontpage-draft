abstract: "Drawing inference about incumbent quality or effort from incumbent performance underpins electoral accountability. However, interpreting a performance signal is often complicated by the myriad of unit-specific and period-specific factors beyond the incumbent's control that also influence observable outcomes. Providing voters with benchmarks has the potential to help them to filter the signal from the noise. This project experimentally compares and combines spatial and temporal benchmarks in the context of providing information about recent or longer-term municipal homicide rates across Mexico. Specifically, I assess spatial benchmarks, temporal benchmarks, and a difference-in-differences combination of the two. Leveraging a panel of voters from large municipalities holding municipal elections on July 1, 2018, I examine which benchmarks are most relevant to voters by comparing the effects of different types and combinations of benchmarks on voters' beliefs and self-reported municipal and presidential vote choices, as well as the extent to which voters are able to process benchmarked information---a likely necessary condition for observing any effect."
