abstract: "This randomized control trial will measure the effectiveness of the Tamil Nadu Governmentâ€™s policy intervention to improve early childhood education standards in government schools and shift student enrollment from private to public schools. The policy will implement LKG/UKG (lower and upper kindergarten) classes in Anganwadi Centers (AWCs) that are co-located in middle schools by assigning surplus government teachers to teach the LKG/UKG programs. By changing the provision of public education in these AWCs/schools, the intervention changes the menu of educational options in the entire market. Thus, the experiment and sampling are designed to measure market-level treatment effects along two main dimensions: 1)	Learning outcomes of students at the end of kindergarten and through early primary grades, and 2) changes in enrolment shares across public/private/out-of-schooling sectors at the pre-primary and primary levels.
