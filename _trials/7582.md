abstract: "Elderly individuals across the world are increasingly living alone. However, little is known about the effects of loneliness on economic and health outcomes. The elderly living alone (i.e., in a household of size 1) will be randomized into one of two cross-randomized intervention arms or a control condition to improve older individuals' mental wellbeing as well as ability to cover basic needs, particularly in times of COVID (including health). The first intervention will focus on improving the elderly's outlook on life and relationships through problem-solving therapy (PST) delivered over the phone. The second will deliver to them a one-time cash transfer of Rs.1000, equivalent to the emergency help amount distributed to ration card holder by the government of Tamil Nadu. Each intervention will be offered on its own in each of two treatment arms, and in combination in a third. A control group will receive no intervention. Investigators will track outcomes of the elderly at 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year after the intervention."
