abstract: "Using a randomized control trial in Recife, a big city located at the Northeast in Brazil, this work collected data that will allow us evaluate the impact of a building block program on the development of cognitive and socio-emotional skills, and the mechanism behind this impact. We investigate the impact of the program at 3rd and 5th grade student (If the students are at correct school-age, they should be 9 years old at the 3rd grade, and 11 years old at the 5th grade.) in 30 public elementary schools. Half of the schools were allocate to treated group, and the other 15 were allocated to the control group. Since Recife is a big city with lots of geografic heterogeneity, we did a pairwise randomization based on the geographic location of the schools. We collected two rounds of data in 2014 of third and fifth graders enrolled in 30 elementary public schools (15 participants and 15 control-group schools). In both baseline (prior to the program) and follow-up (by the end school year) rounds, we collected data on the students' socio-emotional components (Big Five and Locus of Control) and five cognitive abilities: verbal-logical reasoning, abstract reasoning, spatial reasoning, numerical reasoning and logical reasoning.
