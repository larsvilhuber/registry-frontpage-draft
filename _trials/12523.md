abstract: "In a recent paper, Acemoglu et al. (2023) show that democracies breed their own support, but only when they are successful along key dimensions, including economic growth, provision of public goods, limited inequality. With this background, recent decades present a somewhat puzzling combination of relative economic success with declining support for democracy at a global scale. However, there is no contradiction. One important consideration is that support for democracy is likely influenced by perceptions of economic success, which may or may not be accurate. Democracies today have to deal new patterns of political communication brought about by the spread of social media. Misinformation and echo chambers may break the link between economic success in democracies and support for democracy.

Understanding how information about the economic performance of democracies and autocracies shapes support for democracy is a key challenge for the present day, as the declining support for democracy is plausibly related to episodes of democratic backsliding and rise in right-wing populist movements. Information itself, and the medium through which it is delivered, may both be key for the formation of democratic attitudes. In this study, we propose a survey experiment with different information treatments to test how information on the performance of democracies and autocracies, coming from different sources, affect the beliefs about the economic performance of political regimes and to test how changes in these beliefs affect support for democracy."
