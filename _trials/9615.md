abstract: "What is the impact of a food aid program? We conduct a randomized controlled trial in the Mankhurd settlement in Mumbai, India. 

By randomly assigning urban settlement dwellers into a food subsidy program or to a control benchmark, we examine outcomes related to:

i) nutritional purchases
ii) food preferences, insecurity and dietary diversity 
iii) substitution towards other commodities and overall expenditures
iv) well-being.
