abstract: "Online interactions anchor on the creation and maintenance of individuals’ virtual profiles. As a critical component of virtual profiles, digital photos are subject to artificial enhancements and may deviate from individuals’ actual physical appearances. The ubiquitous adoption of digital photo enhancement applications may influence how individuals behave in online interactions. We study, with a controlled online experiment, how individuals’ trust and trustworthiness change after digitally enhancing their profile photos in an online experiment. Participants play the trust game (Berg et al. 1995) with players’ profile photos shown saliently on the game interface. Participants in the treatment group enhance their profile photos and use enhanced profile photos, which participants in the control group use original profile photos during the game. We ask the participants to complete a comprehensive posttest after the game. We compare the levels of trust and trustworthiness between treatment and control groups to show the main effect of digital photo enhancement. We intend to further analyze the potential gender difference, beauty premium, and mechanism in such effect."
