abstract: "The Colombian school system is divided into private and public schools, with the latter showing a significantly worse performance in terms of high-school exit exams and university enrolment. Moreover, the school system has been criticized for an unequal distribution of resources, disadvantaging public schools. These imbalances have far-reaching consequences for educational equity, as students in public schools tend to come from a lower socioeconomic background. In addition to differences in school quality, these children are also less likely to have parents who completed higher education. Their social networks thus often lack role models that could inspire and help them escape poverty through educational success, good choices with respect to tertiary education or help with getting a foot in the door of the formal sector, for example through a job or internship referral. To help overcome these obstacles to social mobility and educational equity, we have developed and piloted a mentoring program for disadvantaged youths in Bogota in 2018, called Más allá de 11 (beyond 11th grade). This intervention changes the participating high-school student's social network by adding a young adult with a different socio-economic background: a university student who takes over the role as a mentor. The aim is thereby not to provide educational tutoring but to establish a relationship of trust and offer support in broadening their perspectives and aspirations, setting goals for their life beyond high school, and defining necessary steps to achieve those goals. For this purpose, mentors and mentees meet regularly on a one-to-one basis for 8-10 months during a crucial phase of the mentee's life: the year before the centralized achievement test that all Colombian high-school students take at the end of grade 11, the Saber 11 test. The goal of the registered study is to thoroughly evaluate the program's effects on the Saber 11 test scores and other outcomes."
