abstract: "The study evaluates the behavioural intervention that leads to  amnesty uptake and subsequent settlement of arrears through a natural field experiment. In addition, it examines  the role of message sequencing in influencing compliance with the amnesty. Using email messages, 34,886 delinquents are randomly assigned to four groups. In the first phase,we use a between subject design where subjects receive benefit-oriented , deterrence, and dynamic social norms.The sequence continues for non-takers until they receive each of the three treatments. Those who do not take up the amnesty  receive another messages on social norms or benefits different from the first receipt. contrary, the control and deterrence group receives the same message inform of reminders in each round .Outcomes of interest are amnesty uptake and subsequent payments. We extend behavioural intervention literature by focusing on delinquents in an amnesty  context when  policy is silent on enforcement measures post amnesty. Similarly, we introduce sequencing in a within subject design and evaluate its effectiveness in enhancing compliance behaviour. "
