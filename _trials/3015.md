abstract: "This study describes the randomized control trial (RCT) conducted by the World Bank’s Africa Gender Innovation Lab (GIL) to evaluate the Feed the Future Nigeria Livelihoods Project (FNLP). This impact evaluation, beyond providing an estimation of the impact of the FNLP bundled support package (the combination of nutrition, livelihood and agriculture extension programs provided at the village level), focused on evaluating two key interventions: 1) a household mentoring program to deliver livelihood planning and training (caseworker model), and 2) unconditional cash transfers for the extremely vulnerable households.

FNLP is a multi-component development project based on the ultra-poor graduation model that intends to help 42,000 very poor households across rural communities of northern Nigeria’s Sokoto and Kebbi states, and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). FNLP is a 5-year program implemented by Catholic Relief Services (CRS). Both the program and the impact evaluation are funded by United States Agency for International Development (USAID). 

This program approach is founded on an agriculture-led growth strategy that is expected to help vulnerable families diversify their income and grow assets while the community is strengthened by improving nutrition, water sanitation, and hygiene. The most vulnerable families receive cash transfers. A caseworker led livelihood mentoring scheme also matches households with the resources they need to engage effectively in the local economy and break free from the cycle of poverty and malnutrition.
