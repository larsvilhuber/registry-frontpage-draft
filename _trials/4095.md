abstract: "A growing literature suggests that the lack of quality management keeps many developing country firms at a low level of productivity. Why donâ€™t firms invest in the general management skills of their workers? A possible reason is that employers may capture only part of the benefits of training because trained managers get recruited by other firms. In this project, we test whether turnover risk contributes to low firm investment in managerial training through an RCT with a sample of firms in and around Addis Ababa. This work is done in conjunction with the collection of a longitudinal dataset."
