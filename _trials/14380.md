abstract: "Do parents process information about their child’s performance or decisions in an optimistic manner?

I exogenously manipulate the ego-relevance of signals parents receive regarding their child’s relative performance or choices. Additionally, I examine whether parents engage in ex-post rationalization when confronted with negative signals about their child’s relative performance or decisions."
