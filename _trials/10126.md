abstract: "European welfare states are being challenged by persisting health inequalities. Against this background, this study will examine the relation between health attribution and health policy preferences. The purpose is twofold. First, we aim to unravel how citizens attribute health inequalities and what the individual-level predictors of health inequality attribution are. Second, we aim to gain a better understanding of how health attribution shapes health policy preferences. To this end, the study draws on a survey experiment and observational data, to be fielded among the German population. The module is part of a large-N opinion survey on inequality and social mobility conducted by the University of Konstanz. "
