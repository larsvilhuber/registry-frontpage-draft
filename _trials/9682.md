abstract: "In February 2022, millions of Ukrainians fled their country after Russia’s invasion producing the fastest mass migration to Europe in decades. The European Council responded by adopting extraordinary temporary protection measures to assist the incoming people (“refugees”). But what are the Europeans’ attitudes towards temporary protection in general and for specific demographic groups? We evaluate how these attitudes vary with the demographic traits of the people displaced, reasons why they had to leave their country, and the rights covered under temporary protection (e.g., housing, labor market). We also evaluate the extent to which individuals can be persuaded to adopt more inclusionary attitudes towards refugees by being stimulated to take the perspective of a refugee (i.e., consider how he or she may think or feel about the situation) or by considering narratives that give a refugee’s perspective. Results may contribute to better social marketing communication to ease tensions associated with immigration. They may also inform preparedness programs for future refugee crises, especially in terms of preferable returns, integration, and relocation policies and how to activate these policy levers during a crisis."
