abstract: "The goal of this project is to reduce effluent violations under the Clean Water Act (CWA) National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed an automated, facility-targeted messaging system to encourage compliance with NPDES permit limits and reduce overall effluent levels. This study will examine how effective early forms of notifications or warnings could be in inducing facilities to self-correct problems before they become chronic violators. We will evaluate the impact of this notification system on compliance through a randomized controlled trial (RCT), which will generate evidence on both the overall effectiveness of the system at changing effluent violation rates and which configurations of messaging duration and recipient have the greatest impact on facility effluent discharges."
