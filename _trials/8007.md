abstract: "This research project would use a 2x2 factorial experiment to analyze how norms of similarity can decrease perceived threat and increase support for policing reforms. Drawing inspiration from previous experiments (Smith et al, 2012), the treatments will consist of the presentation of a summary or news article discussing results from an ostensible study assessing ingroup and outgroup attitudes and behaviors. The content of the treatments will be customized based on the findings of stage one."
