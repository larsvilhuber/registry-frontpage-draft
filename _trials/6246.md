abstract: "Pursuing optimal design and user experience of digital products is key for companies to stay competitive in the market. User-centered design techniques inspired by design thinking, such as the “Design Sprint”, have the potential of improving the quality of digital products design. Yet, many SMEs are not aware of the added value of these techniques and are not equipped to adopt them. The 200SMEchallenge project aims at building evidence on the effectiveness of a two-day Design Sprint initiative coming in the format of a “UX Challenge” (User eXperience Challenge) on SMEs’ awareness and readiness to adopt user-centered design. More precisely, the project addresses the following evaluation question: for SMEs operating in the digital industry sector or other SMEs that develop products bearing digital interfaces, does participating in the UX Challenge, rather than not participating, enhance knowledge, awareness and intention to adopt the innovative approaches in the design of digital products? The evaluation features a randomized controlled trial that will be conducted in Winter-Spring 2021 and will involve 200 SMEs based in seven EU regions. The impact of the UX Challenge will be assessed on SMEs’ Digital Design Readiness and Awareness, measured with a set of survey-collected indices on knowledge, attitudes and planned actions related to digital design approaches. The project is funded by the European Commission (Grant Agreement number 824212 — 200SMEchallenge — H2020-INNOSUP-2018-2020)."
