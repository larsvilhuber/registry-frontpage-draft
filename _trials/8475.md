abstract: "The Japanese government suspended the Go To Travel campaign that it had launched in 2020 because of the spread of COVID-19. However, the number of new cases of infection nationwide continues to decrease in Japan. In this study, we examine the effects of the Go To Travel campaign on the Oita-prefecture tourist decision making. Oita-prefecture is a famous tourist spot in Japan. 
To investigate this, we will conduct an online survey experiment on tourist decision making, under certain conditions including the nudge-based text, lack of COVID-19 vaccination certificate, reduced business hours of bars, and declaration of a state of emergency. Based on the theoretical framework in Allcott and Kessler (2019, American Economic Journal: Applied Economics), we estimate the social welfare effect in each situation, using the collected data. We also make the simulation, using synthesized data of the entire Japanese population , to estimate the welfare changes caused by the spread of COVID-19."
