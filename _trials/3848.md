abstract: "Promotion of Orange-Flesh Sweet Potato (OFSP) has been found to be an effective intervention to reduce vitamin A deficiency and symptoms thereof in women and children in East African communities. However, there is no such study testing the potential of OFSP as an effective intervention to reduce vitamin A deficiency of diet and associated negative health symptoms in the Indian context. Further, evidence is mixed as to the benefits of promoting OFSP using nutrition-behavior change strategies. This is a three-arm randomized trial testing the effectiveness of orange sweet potato promotion through agricultural and nutrition interventions in 15 villages in Northern Uttar Pradesh, India. The study has enrolled 1,532 consenting households to be surveyed for demographic, socioeconomic, agricultural, and dietary indicators three times over one and a half years. Five villages served as control villages and received no intervention. All ten intervention villages received 6 months of agricultural promotion of OFSP via monthly Farmer Field Schools (FSS), including one distribution of planting material at the start of the study. Five of these ten villages were randomly selected to receive 5 months of monthly nutrition information events focusing on the importance of vitamin A, the uses of OFSP in the diet, and beneficial infant and young child feeding practices. Primary outcomes are the adoption of orange sweet potato, consumption of orange sweet potato and likelihood of vitamin A adequacy of diet. This study has been approved by Cornell University IRB (Protocol Number 1708007352).
