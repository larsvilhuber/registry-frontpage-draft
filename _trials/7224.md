abstract: "Digitization has lead to large changes in the way that people look for and decide between jobs.  We use a randomized controlled trial to study the effects of company reviews and ratings on jobseeker behavior.  We conduct a field experiment on a large jobs website in the USA, which hosts job postings as well as collecting reviews and ratings of companies from current and former employees.  We display ratings and review information at the bottom of job adverts, and test for the effects of this treatment on a user's decision whether or not to apply.
