abstract: "Can a financial service be used to improve educational outcomes? To answer this question, Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) partnered with the Private Education Development Network (PEDN) to design and implement the Super Savers Program. A school based savings program, the Super Savers Program aimed to connect savings and education in Uganda. Along with program implementation, IPA directed a research study to assess the program’s impact. 

The study used a randomized control design to measure the impact of different variations of the Super Savers Program. In one variation, students who participated received their savings in cash at school, with some encouragement to invest their savings towards school expenditures. In the second variation, the savings payout was provided in a more restrictive form: vouchers requiring an education-related purchase. Students at a third group of schools served as a comparison. 

The program variation which included a savings payout in the form of cash generated higher savings in the program accounts. When combined with a parent outreach program, the program led to an increase in the percentage of children in the classroom with basic scholastic materials and an 8% increase in test scores on an exam covering language and math skills. We find no effect for the fully-committed account, and we find no effect for either account on attendance, enrollment, or non-cognitive skills. 

The results from this study contribute to existing research in two ways: First, while we know that savings programs are particularly effective when tied to a specific goal—such as education—putting too many restrictions on payouts can be counteractive. Second, reaching out to parents and households can be an important way to improve primary education.
