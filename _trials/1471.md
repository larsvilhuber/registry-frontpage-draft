abstract: "Low adoption of agricultural technologies holds large productivity consequences for developing countries.
Agricultural extension services counter information failures by deploying external agents to communicate
with farmers. However, social networks are recognized as the most credible source of information
about new technologies. We incorporate social learning in extension policy using a large-scale field
experiment in which we communicate to farmers using different members of social networks. We
show that communicator effort is susceptible to small performance incentives, and the social identity
of the communicator influences learning and adoption. Farmers find communicators who face agricultural
conditions and constraints most comparable to themselves to be the most persuasive. Incorporating
communication dynamics can take the influential social learning literature in a more policy-relevant
direction."
