abstract: "Using a sample of over 200 carpools randomized on gender and race, I find that race, in addition to gender, is a significant factor in competitive behavior. Competition-averse preferences, often attributed to females generally, may actually be concentrated among white females. On the aggregate, female drivers do indeed drive slower than male drivers in carpools. Disaggregating the effect by race, however, reveals that white females are responsible for the result, as there are no differences in driving speeds between male drivers and non-white female drivers. These results suggest that competition and gender research may be incomplete without accounting for race."
