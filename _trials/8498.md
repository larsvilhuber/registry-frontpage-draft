abstract: "We study how Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) affect assets prices under two distinct environments: (1) when all three assets are included in the index, and (2) when one of the two identical assets is excluded from the index and replaced by an equivalent identical asset. The authorized participants (APs) are modeled via bots that create and redeem ETF shares by scanning the order book of the underlying assets. We ask whether inclusion of an asset in the ETF index results in an index premium and whether this persists even after short-selling is allowed.
