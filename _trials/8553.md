abstract: "Consumer credit markets feature large amounts of price dispersion, and different banks can offer the same consumer substantially different interest rates. Nevertheless, consumers do not search much across banks: in Chile, only 3% of consumers searched at another bank after receiving a loan offer. Consumers may not search because they have inaccurate expectations about price dispersion or the benefits of search. We built an interactive loan price comparison tool using administrative data on the universe of consumer loans from Chile's financial regulator (CMF). The tool provides just-in-time, personalized information by showing potential consumers the distribution of interest rates that similar consumers received for similar loans in the past six months. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) among Chilean consumers searching for a loan to measure the impact of the loan price comparison tool on beliefs about prices and price dispersion, planned and actual search behavior, loan characteristics, and financial health and well-being."
