abstract: "We investigate whether moral nudges influence behavior of bank employees in financial credence goods situations. Usually, bank customers seek financial advice because they do not have sufficient information about complex financial products. This asymmetric information makes the market for financial advice a credence good market (Darby and Karni, 1973) – i.e., even after consumption customers cannot judge whether the “treatment” of the service was appropriate or not. Although there is vast literature focusing on asymmetric information and especially its relevance for advisers’ incentives, there is only little research on how the credence goods properties affect financial advisers’ behavior.  Therefore, in this study, we analyze whether and how nudging employees with questions about the moral dimension of financial advice and/or ethical reminders influence their ethical behavior in their financial advice to clients.
