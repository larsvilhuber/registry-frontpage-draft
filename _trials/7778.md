abstract: "In the developing world, mental health problems go largely untreated: four out of every five people with a mental health problem in the developing world do not receive any form of help (Jordans, 2019).  In this study, we first aim to document the extent of mental health problems and what barriers stand in the way of help seeking behavior in four districts of Nepal amongst adolescents (aged 10-16) and their parents. Second, we provide information treatments in order to determine ways to increase the up take of mental health services such as counseling and to reduce personal and anticipated stigma around receiving help for a mental health issue. We provide two types of information treatments. The first is aimed at reducing personal and anticipated stigma through the use of information on the prevalence of mental health issues and the efficacy of treatments such as counseling. The second treatment is aimed at increasing take up through the use of story telling and role models. We also introduce a third non-information treatment: matching the gender of some enumerators to household respondents. Using this treatment, we test levels of comfort and willingness to share about mental health issues by gender-match. Ultimately, this study is aimed at identifying barriers to help-seeking for those with mental health issues and breaking down those barriers through easily scalable, low-cost treatments that reduce stigma and encourage use of services.
