abstract: "This paper documents how quickly immigrants adopt the cultural behaviors of natives and studies if growing up in an ethnic enclave slows down or speeds up the dynamics of convergence. To measure cultural behavior, I use administrative data on prescription of contraceptives to women. To identify neighborhood effects, I use the random assignment of asylum seekers to welcome centers in the Netherlands in the 1990s and 2000s. To capture social interactions and isolate peer effects, I merge the information on prescriptions with administrative data on schools attended by teenage women. "
