abstract: "Large gender differences in earnings prevail worldwide in almost all occupations, and entrepreneurship is no exception. Women’s businesses are typically less productive, but also smaller and less capital-intensive than men’s. Despite the vast literature reporting the gender gap in profitability, its causes are not well understood. Our study examines the role of business characteristics and discrimination on gender disparities in profitability. We study small-scale produce businesses in India. We first conduct a survey to establish that women’s businesses are both less profitable and smaller than men’s in this context. Using a large-scale field experiment, we test whether giving men and women the same business closes the gap in profitability. We set up our own market stalls, to which we randomly assign male and female vendors. We thus exogenously vary gender, holding the business constant. The evidence from this experiment shows how much of the gender gap in this context is due to business characteristics alone. To examine the role of client discrimination more specifically, we conduct a second experiment with packaged goods instead of vegetables. "
