abstract: "We study the effects of carbon pricing expectations on the willingness to adopt electric vehicles (EV) in China. We randomly alter the individual expectation on carbon prices by assigning them to different expert estimates. Individuals are randomly assigned to one of the three expert estimates of carbon prices in 2050: (i) a high price, (ii) a low price, (iii) a low price but a high variation. We would like to measure the impact of expectations of carbon pricing on the interest in receiving a report on EV, the willingness to adopt an EV, and the general willingness to reduce carbon footprints.
