abstract: "	We analyze the effects of providing STEM education on career aspirations and gender attitudes of elementary and secondary school students in Tabora region of Tanzania. The STEM education was provided by a local social enterprise e3empower for 5 days as a form of bootcamp. The bootcamp consists of an introduction to computer and programming sessions to use basic coding to create robots and a simple app. The purpose of STEM bootcamp is to increase the exposure of new technologies so that students can improve their creativity, computational thinking, and problem solving skills, and they can enhance their motivation to learn, especially STEM fields. The STEM bootcamp program may have an impact beyond just the knowledge on STEM subjects. For instance, it may affect students’ non-cognitive outcomes such as confidence, long-term career aspirations in STEM fields, and gender attitudes. Given under representativeness of women in STEM fields, we investigate the impact of STEM bootcamp by gender.
