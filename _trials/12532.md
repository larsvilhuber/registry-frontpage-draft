abstract: ""The latest tax reform (Law 2277 of 2022) included changes in criminal offenses (sanctions) against tax evasion in the country. These modifications are outlined in Article 60 of the aforementioned law. It is the first time in Colombia that penalties for income and wealth tax evasion may lead to imprisonment.
This change can be used to identify shifts in taxpayers' behavior when filing their tax returns."
