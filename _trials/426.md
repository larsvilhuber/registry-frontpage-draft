abstract: "People’s decisions to make donations – be they of money of time – have been shown by previous research to be heavily influenced by the behaviour of others, particularly their friends and family. Such research is typically limited to the quasi-experimental realm, as the number of ‘voices’ with which charities and experimenters can speak is typically limited. In this paper, we investigate the impact of a ‘network nudge’ on tendency to donate time, as part of one of the British government’s largest volunteering campaigns. "
