abstract: "In this project, we replicate the four main treatments in Angerer et al. (2022) using a neutral frame (instead of a healthcare frame). 

We experimentally investigate the effect of public consumer ratings on market outcomes in credence goods markets. Contrary to search or experience goods, consumers cannot evaluate all dimensions of trade for credence goods, which may inhibit the information and reputation-building value of public rating systems. We implement a expert market in which experts have an informational advantage over consumers with respect to the apppropriate treatment. The rating system takes the form of a five-star rating system as is common on online rating websites. The value of this rating system is compared in two different expert market settings: First, one in which consumers cannot rely on information from personal experience with the expert, reflecting markets in which consumer-expert interactions are often first-time and infrequent. Second, one in which consumers have personal experience with the expert, reflecting markets in which consumer-expert interactions are frequent and repeated.
