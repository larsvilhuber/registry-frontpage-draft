abstract: "The research assesses the socio-economic impact of a training program for youth from Boroko district in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. The impact of the training program will be made on the basis of primary data collected before and then after the training through a purpose-designed survey. The study aims to contribute to existing knowledge by providing a detailed analysis of how targeted training programs can lift socio-economic outcomes, namely employment, income, and access to public services. The research is expected to generate insights into the effectiveness of enhancing access to education for employment that, in turn, has flow-on benefits to the family and the broader community. The lessons emanating from the study have implications for scalable and sustainable interventions of a similar nature. The research design, survey tools and data analysis here are aligned with the Multi-Indicator Cluster Sample (MICS- version 6) and Randomized Controlled Trials in World Bank guidelines. These guidelines offer a comprehensive framework for designing surveys, including questionnaire development, sampling techniques, and data collection strategies. The impact of the training program will be assessed using a difference-in-difference quantitative method."
