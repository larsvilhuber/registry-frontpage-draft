abstract: " Research suggests that spending time with a child has a direct and causal effect on childrenâ€™s cognitive test scores and socioemotional development, and it is the most productive input for cognitive and socioemotional skill development. For children from low socioeconomic backgrounds in particular, efforts to promote their holistic development during adversities hinge on parent-child engagement and parental investments in children. Using a Randomized Control Trial design, this research project will implement a phone-nudges program to spark changes in parent motivation and behavior. "
