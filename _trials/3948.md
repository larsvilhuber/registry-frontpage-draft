abstract: "This aim of this research is to assess the impact of anchoring in Becker-deGroot-Marschak experiments. The research will create an incentive-compatible experiment to elicit the willingness-to-accept (WTA) smart meters for a representative panel of UK households. 

The incentive-compatible Becker-deGroot-Marschak (BDM) method of non-market valuation is an improvement upon many stated preference methods that environmental economists use to elicit preferences for environmental goods using hypothetical payouts. The method works by allowing individuals who do not want a free smart meter to select a value that they would accept as compensation for having a smart meter installed in their homes. The researchers then randomly draw a value within a delineated range, and if the value equals or exceeds the stated WTA, then the transaction takes place (i.e. the individual receives the offer in exchange for signing up for the smart meter). If the number drawn is below their WTA, no such transaction takes place. The research team aims to elicit a monetary value for consumersâ€™ WTA smart meter installations in their homes conditional on various treatments designed to reduce barriers to energy-related technology adoption (as per Gillingham and Palmer, 2014).  

This initial pilot intended to understand the implications of various features of the methodology, households will receive the 'control' condition from above (i.e. without information aimed at increasing adoption) but we will randomly vary or withhold the delineated range of our potential offer in order to assess the impact of this information on the elicited willingness-to-accept. This pilot will inform the structure of the BDM in the main survey."
