abstract: "Could well-being and engagement of employees in organisations increase if they adopted healthier behaviours and lifestyles? The goal of this study is to address this question by testing to what extent certain psychological barriers limit the ability of employees to invest in healthy behaviours and increase employee well-being and engagement. The findings of this project are expected to be relevant for organisational stakeholders, who are interested in innovative approaches to enhance efficiency of organisations and need satisfaction of their employees."
