abstract: "The main question we address is why donâ€™t more SMEs use the market for professional business services like accounting, marketing and HR? Such marketplaces form a crucial institution that can support private sector growth and innovation, yet they are inefficient in developing economies. We hypothesize that two key reasons are firms (i) lack information about the availability of these services, and (ii) cannot distinguish the quality of good versus bad providers. We conduct a randomized experiment to test a) the extent to which firms react to different forms of quality information given to them about business service providers; and b) whether information about the existence and quality of providers in turn is sufficient to get SMEs to purchase services from these providers."
