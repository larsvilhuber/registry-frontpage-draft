abstract: "Our study presents a novel design to test the effectiveness of nonmonetary incentives and peer pressure
to enforce a health policy. We will ask students and parents to sign an agreement that commits parents to
monitor their children at home and penalizes the students for smoking at school. The penalty is nonmonetary
in nature, thereby making it more sustainable and more easily scalable. In a subset of schools, we also
introduce group competition to test the effectiveness of peer support and pressure for improving health
behavior."
