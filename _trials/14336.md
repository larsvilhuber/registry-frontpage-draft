abstract: "This trial, which is called "Carrot and a Stick", evaluating ways of using punishment and rewards to encourage pro-social behavior. You have been invited because we would like to see how individuals react to different combinations of reward and punishment and show which works best for encouraging people to contribute to a public good.
