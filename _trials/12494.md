abstract: "This study aims to understand if women internalize "the limited commitment problem" — that is, the risk of divorce and the consequences of household specialization in the event of divorce — when considering their future financial situation and making decisions about household specialization. To do this, we randomize exposure to a (real) divorce experience through a brief testimonial video that highlights women's experiences and decision-making regarding divorce-associated financial risks and household specialization. We measure whether exposure to a divorce experience can shift women’s perception of divorce risk and divorce-related financial risks. Additionally, we measure whether this exposure may change women’s willingness to take preventive measures to mitigate these risks."
