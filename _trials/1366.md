abstract: "This study addresses two questions: 1) How to promote demand for male circumcision in the context of secondary schools in Malawi and 2) What is the role of peer eﬀects in the demand for male circumcision. We randomly provided free male circumcision and transportation vouchers to male students across 33 public secondary schools near Lilongwe, Malawi. Using a two-step randomized design, we ﬁrst assigned classrooms into three groups (100% Treatment, 50% Treatment, or No Treatment classrooms) and then also randomly selected half of male students in 50% Treatment classrooms for treatment.
