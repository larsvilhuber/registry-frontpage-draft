abstract: "GreenState Credit Union (GSCU) and Washington University’s Social Policy Institute (SPI) are engaged in a research partnership to test and evaluate several different interventions to promote financial wellness among GSCU members. The purpose of this project is to identify interventions that “move the needle” in helping members (1) resolve delinquency on GSCU loans, (2) prevent delinquency on loans, or (3) utilize holistic financial counseling to bolster their financial capabilities, helping with (1) & (2). The research flow divides GSCU members into three sub-populations labeled A, B,and C, which correspond, respectively, to the three objectives above. At the start of the study, GSCU will randomly assign all members into these three populations, and members within each population will then be randomly assigned to either a “control” or “treatment” sub-group. If the latter, the member will receive the appropriate treatment if pre-determined (e.g. experiencing delinquency) criteria are met."
