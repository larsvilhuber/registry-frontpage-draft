abstract: "In this study, we try to understand the relationship between inflation expectations and wage expectations. Using a novel and large-scale survey of inflation expectations for the US, we treat respondents with information regarding wage growth and inflation to investigate the causal relationship between inflation expectations and wage expectations. We want to evaluate how changes in inflation expectation changes wage expectations from consumers."
