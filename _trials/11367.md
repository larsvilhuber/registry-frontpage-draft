abstract: "Mary’s Place is a nonprofit organization in Seattle that provides services to women and families with current and previous experience of homelessness with the goal of ensuring that no child sleeps outside. They are launching a new homelessness prevention service informed by Santa Clara County’s homelessness prevention program. Because the past policy focus has primarily been on treatment, there is little evidence about which prevention programs work best and for whom. Our research project attempts to address this gap in the research by comparing the efficacy and cost effectiveness of prevention as a whole as well as comparing two different prevention strategies within the sample population. First, when services are oversubscribed due to budget and staffing limits, Mary’s Place will use random assignment to determine who is served first. Comparing people higher and lower on the waitlist will measure the effectiveness of receiving assistance. Second, we will use a lottery among program participants to measure the effectiveness of (1) intensive homelessness prevention services with a large cap on financial assistance and access to repeat assistance relative to (2) a traditional model of a smaller-capped, one-time financial assistance. Thus, the primary difference between the services provided to the two groups will be the intensity of financial assistance.

The results of this study will be informative to policymakers and service providers in other communities that are interested in the most effective means of homelessness prevention. Enrollment began in May of 2023 and will continue until we have enrolled approximately 3,708 households.  Researchers had not received data on outcomes at the time of filing of this pre-analysis plan. Given the potentially wide-ranging effect of homelessness prevention, we identified three outcome domains for study: (a) receipt of services, (b) housing stability, and (c) family and child well-being."
