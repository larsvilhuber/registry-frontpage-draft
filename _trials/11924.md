abstract: "People are known to egocentrically discount instrumentally valuable information acquired through social interactions. In this paper, I explore whether this is driven by preferences over the identity of information sources using online experiments where the identity of information sources and the value of information are exogenously assigned. The study focuses on caste identity in India, and asks whether people have preferences for information that are based on the caste identity of the information source. "
