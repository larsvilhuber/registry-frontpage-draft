abstract: "Many small firms lack the managerial capital (e.g., business skills in marketing, finance, etc.) needed for firm growth. One approach in many development programs has been to provide small firms with more prescriptive consulting services focused on implementation of a defined set of management practices, then examine the impact on financial performance (e.g., profitability, productivity). However, there has been limited research on understanding the role of more progressive consulting services aimed at dynamic business changes and the effect on marketplace performance (e.g., sales, sales growth). Consequently, there has not yet been a study investigating the impact of marketing-linked consulting interventions on the top-line of small firms – including measuring main effect outcomes such as sales and understanding how different mechanism channels might drive this growth. For instance, we know little about how to stimulate intermediate outcomes more aligned with marketplace performance such as generating demand via greater customer closeness, expanding customer reach via new geographies, channels or segments, and changing the customer offering to better meet needs and preferences – in other words the Customer Centricity of a firm. We therefore test the impact of more progressive, dynamic consulting services on firm sales and marketplace-related metrics through a randomized experiment with Nigerian entrepreneurs. The sample of small and medium firms will be randomized into three groups: a control group, a group given business training for the owner and a group given consulting services. Impacts on business practices, firm sales and employment growth, market growth and change in customer centricity will then be measured to determine the most effective way of building skills in SMEs."
