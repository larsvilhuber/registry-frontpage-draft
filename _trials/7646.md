abstract: "Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in England adopt productivity improving software at far lower rates than those in other comparable economies; this trial is evaluating whether a website that provides guidance and information to SMEs on how to purchase and implement the best software for their needs can improve adoption rates of software systems. The population being studied is SME banking clients of a high street bank in England. 

This trial will compare outcomes for SMEs receiving differing levels of support from a Relationship Manager (RM) at their bank to use the website. In Arm 1 (the control arm), SMEs will not be given any information about the website. In arm 2, SMEs are provided only simple signposting to the website by their RM. In Arm 3, SMEs will be signposted to the website and will additionally have their RM walk through the website with them in a regularly scheduled meeting. 

This is a cluster randomised trial; relationship managers will be randomly assigned to trial arms.

The primary outcome for this trial is steps taken towards adoption of software systems. The secondary outcomes are: a) adoption of software systems across five categories; b) intention to adopt software systems across five categories; and c) product engagement rates (self-reported use of the website)
