abstract: "Women are underrepresented in many technical and scientific subjects at university including Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) and Economics. In the United Kingdom, women account for only 32% of Economics undergraduate students. Preferences for fields of study are largely formed before university and, among many others, stereotypes formed or reinforced before enrolment are important. One factor that likely influences subject choices is recommendations that students receive from career advisers about university subjects. However, we know little about to what extent career advice is potentially (gender) biased. If such biases exist, one way to reduce them is through training and informing career advisers about those pitfalls. This project aims to fill this gap in knowledge by shedding light on the university subject recommendations made by career advisers to secondary school students leading up to their decision of what subject to study at university. 

This project seeks to understand to what extent career advisers are potentially (gender) biased in their recommendations, such that they might be more likely to recommend gender-stereotypical subjects to students. We intend to have a better understanding of the subject recommendations that career advisers make to secondary school students and explore if information provision about gender bias in Economics can reduce gender-stereotypical recommendations. To this end, we will first collect recommendations from career advisers and ask them to complete an Implicit Association Test (IAT) focusing on bias related to subjects through an online survey. Next, we will run an online workshop for career advisers and inform them about (gender bias in) Economics and reveal their IAT results. We aim to evaluate the effects of this workshop on recommendations in a follow-up survey.
