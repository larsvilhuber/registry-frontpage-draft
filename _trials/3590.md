abstract: "Several lines of reasoning support the notion to reduce the consumption of meat in developed countries. We conduct a field experiment with a representative sample of the German population to test whether exposure to health (private good), animal welfare (public good, inter-species altruism) or climate change (public good, intra-species altruism) based reasons to reduce meat consumption are (more) effective in inducing dietary changes relative to a control group.
Furthermore, the experiment allows to gain further insights on the preferences-intention-behavior gap by observing all three components in a controlled setting."
