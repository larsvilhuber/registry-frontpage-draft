abstract: "On the e-commerce platform, there are many products listed for sale online. We can search for the products we want to buy and we click on the product thumbnails and be taken to a detailed online product page where the purchase decisions can be made. For a given product, we can create 3 parallel online product pages. People are randomised into one of them upon clicking on the product and randomisation is at individual-customer level using their unique customer IDs. In this field experiment we use the elements of suspense and surprise to persuade online customers to make favourable purchase decisions. We randomise customers into one control and two treatment groups. We explore how suspense influences customer behaviour."
