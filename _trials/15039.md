abstract: "The main objective of this study is to explore whether fostering socio-emotional skills in preschool children (ages 3-6) can promote social cohesion. Conducted in preschools in Germany, the key component of the intervention among treatment preschools constists of an 8-week, teacher-led comprehensive curriculum that addresses different aspects of social cohesion each week and offers practical advice for handling daily situations. The overarching theme of the program emphasizes that, despite individual differences, we share commonalities, fostering a sense of unity among the children.
