abstract: "Recent studies examine the impact of exposure to mass media—such as the TV programs that incorporate educational elements into an entertainment program (i.e., edutainment)—on individuals’ attitudes to and awareness of social issues in their country, such as gender issues. In this study, we conduct a field experiment in India to evaluate the impact of providing/delivering Japanese comics with pro-social messages on the attitude to the issues of gender, discrimination against people with disabilities, and public health."
