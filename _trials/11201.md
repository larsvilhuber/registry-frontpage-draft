abstract: "There is evidence that labor market outcomes correlate with individuals’ health. We contribute to the literature by asking whether individuals with particular health conditions face different odds in applying for job positions. We use field experiments (correspondence tests) to investigate whether employers’ decision to invite a job candidate for a first interview is affected by the candidate’s health conditions."
