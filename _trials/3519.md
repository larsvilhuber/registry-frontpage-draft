abstract: "The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the effectiveness of Medha’s Career Advancement Bootcamp in increasing the employability of students in India, with a focus on college students. Medha’s goal is to provide critical additional training allowing underprivileged students – particularly women and students from marginalized groups (OBC/SC/ST) –  to build on the skills they are learning in school to be able to launch careers in the private sector. Outcomes of interest include labor market outcomes such as employment status, salary, any promotions, and sector of employment; intermediate outcomes such as the job search process, confidence, and skills development will also be measured."
