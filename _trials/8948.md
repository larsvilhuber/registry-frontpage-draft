abstract: "Several studies point to the presence of a correlation between digital skills and individual characteristics, behavior, attitudes and family context. In the school context, evidence suggests a positive relationship between the use of digital devices in the classroom and students' digital literacy, as well as, in general, documenting that digital skills would be associated with better learning outcomes for children and adolescents. However, most of these studies only present results for developed countries and are limited to establishing correlations. In this sense, the present study seeks to make a relevant contribution to the literature by proposing a long-term evaluation of a large-scale intervention randomly implemented in a Brazilian state, which will allow us to investigate results both on digital knowledge and on habits and behaviors of students towards technology and pedagogical practices of teachers. The intervention involves the offer of electives of digital technologies - focused on Digital Culture - throughout the 3 years of High School in public schools of the state of Goiás-Brazil. The strategy consists of using the school teachers to implement the program, who will receive training focused on technical and pedagogical knowledge."
