abstract: "Despite the reductions in maternal and child mortality ratios in Zambia, the current rates stand at 252 deaths per 100,000 live births for maternal mortality ratio (MMR) and 61.4 deaths per 1,000 live births for child mortality ratio (CMR). These rates are much higher than the global estimates of 152 deaths per 100,000 live births for MMR and 32 deaths per 1,000 live births for CMR. The key barriers to reductions in mortality in this region include poverty, malnutrition, inadequate infrastructure, access to services and gender inequality. 

Gender inequality especially in access to education can have severe health impacts on girls and women including teen pregnancy, early marriages, HIV/AIDS, and poor sexual and reproductive health outcomes. The original randomized control trial (RCT) study “Wheels of Change: Transforming Girls’ Lives with Bicycles” studied if an intervention that provides a bicycle to an adolescent girl translates into higher measures of empowerment and increases her educational outcomes. Many researchers show that women’ empowerment is positively related to greater use of maternal and child health (MCH) services, ability to seek services, improve child nutrition, increase uptake of immunization and contraceptive use, and reduce fertility rates. Therefore, in the current study we want to examine whether receiving a bicycle can lead to positive maternal and child health outcomes among girls who were a part of the Wheels of Change study in 2017.

To examine the mitigating impact of the bicycle, we will conduct a quantitative survey with adolescent girls between 15 and 19 years old by comparing a group of girls that had received a bicycle with a group of girls that did not. We will collect data in communities around the 100 schools (3km or more) that were previously selected under the Wheels of Change RCT study. Under the original study 45 schools were assigned to the treatment group and 55 schools were assigned to the control group. This proposed study will be set up as an independent new study and will be conducted without drawing on any personally identifying information and data from the previous RCT study."
