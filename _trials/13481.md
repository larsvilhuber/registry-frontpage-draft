abstract: "This study addresses how unethical behavior in scientific research impacts trust in science, contributing to a literature on the consequences of corruption and unethical behavior. We propose an informational delivery experiment with high school students in Brazil, where we present them with a summary of a suspected fraud scandal in behavioral science. We divide treated subjects into a "fraud" arm, where they only learn about the fraud accusations, and an "accountability'' arm, where they learn about the investigation and punishment processes involved; this allows us to tell apart the effects of learning about cheating from catching cheaters. We measure the effect on beliefs in science, the use of scientific evidence to update world views, real life attitudes towards science, and spillovers to other fields of research. The results of this experiment can enlighten academic institutions about the consequences of fraud, and guide public communication with respect to informing about accountability."
