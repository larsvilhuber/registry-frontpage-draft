abstract: "The aim of the study is to gain insights into prosocial preference and chances for coordination within an intercultural context. For this, German and Egyptian participants are put into different decision context.

We investigate how the behavior is affected by the identity of the interacting partner. We vary this information by country background (Egypt/Germany) as well as gender (male/female). With this, our study contributes to the literature on gender discrimination in a unique cross-cultural context. Gender-based discrimination within one culture may or may not carry over when interacting with individuals from a different culture or ethnicity. As a novel feature, our experiment allows to also investigate the degree to which discrimination is accepted by the individuals subject to this discrimination. While the treatments vary the identity of the partner of the decision maker, we also investigate how behavior and treatment effects depend on the identity of the decision maker itself.

The experiment combines in a within design several pro-sociality games (dictator, ultimatum game) with a coordination game (battle of sexes) which allows for an ex post punishment conditional on the choice of the partner. We expect that discrimination as identified in the pro-sociality games and its acceptance can facilitate coordination.

Each participant will play the following order of games:
1. Standard dictator Games, varying the costs of transfers
2. Standard Ultimatum Game
3. The coordination game with asymmetric punishment option

Depending on the treatment, for each of the games, the participant will be matched with:
EM: Matched with Egyptian male
EF: Matched with Egyptian female
GM: Matched with German male
GF: Matched with German female
