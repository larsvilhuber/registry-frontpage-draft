abstract: "We use a laboratory experiment to investigate whether statements from a governmental
institution expressing concerns about price increases trigger such increases by facilitating
tacit collusion. Such statements on market conduct are disclosed after an exogenous
and unexpected upward cost shock. The two potential channels affecting tacit collusion
work through (i) a reduction of strategic uncertainty and (ii) an inducement of
correlated beliefs. We find that issued statements of concern become a self-fulfilling
prophecy triggering price increases and that a reduction in strategic uncertainty drives
this adverse effect. Our results suggest that institutions should refrain from publishing
such statements of concern."
