abstract: "The adverse impacts of ambient air pollution and its associated costs have received substantial policy and academic attention. However, the issue of indoor air pollution is often overlooked in academic research and policy discussions, which is surprising given the fact that
individuals in the developed world spend almost 90 percent of their time indoors. Therefore, the potential welfare implications from exposure to indoor air pollution could be very large.

We have designed a field experiment that will explore how access to personalized, real-time indoor air pollution monitoring and information affects individualsâ€™ behavior in reducing their indoor air pollution levels. To investigate this, we will implement the field experiment in London. 

We will also ascertain people's demand and welfare benefits from such monitoring, information, education, and clean indoor air. If the provision of monitoring and information is found to reduce exposure to air pollution and deliver positive health outcomes, indoor air pollution monitoring could be scaled up and combined with other targeted public health campaigns to reduce exposure to harmful pollutants."
