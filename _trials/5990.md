abstract: "This project examines individuals' preferences for receiving feedback on their performance on a male-typed aptitude test. We will explore how preferences for feedback depend on beliefs of absolute and relative performance, degree of uncertainty about own performance, level of difficulty of the task, and gender. We will also elicit unincentivized data on how individuals interpret and generalize both positive and negative feedback."
