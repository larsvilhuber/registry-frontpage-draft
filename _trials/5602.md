abstract: "Studies show that CVs with typically black names receive fewer callbacks than otherwise identical CVs with typically white names (Zschirnt and Ruedin, 2016). However, studies in a more experimental setting have failed to replicate a penalty for black CVs (Kessler et al., 2019). One hypothesis for this discrepancy is that subjects hide their prejudice when they are being monitored. We test this hypothesis by measuring discrimination towards black CVs in the United States under conditions in which the subjects are either aware or unaware that they are being monitored. 
(For Data after 23.06.2020 we extend the analysis to investigate which groups of people discriminate, and which groups react to their being monitored.)"
