abstract: "We conduct a randomized control after-school tutoring experiment in rural China where many children are left-behind by both parents and cared by grandparents. These left-behind children are disadvantaged in after-school learning support received at home and also academically lagging behind compared to their counterparts living with parents. We implement the intervention as an after-school peer tutoring program in which high-achieving senior primary school students are recruited to provide high-dosage, one-on-one tutoring to low-achieving junior primary school students. Our aims are to assess the treatment effects of access to this after-school tutoring intervention on household inputs and student achievements, as well as the potential heterogeneity in the treatment effects between children living with and without parents."
