abstract: "Quality education fosters both academic achievement and social-emotional learning for each child. Social-emotional learning, in particular, helps adolescents better handle the challenges and expectations they will have to face, making them more robust in terms of the challenges in life. Currently, Norway's middle school curriculum and teacher practices do not reflect the international research literature stressing social-emotional learning as a key component of quality education (NOU 2014:7). We will empirically investigate if middle schools can improve adolescents' social-emotional learning, thereby enhancing their social relationship skills, mindfulness, problem-solving skills, emotional regulation, growth mindset, and academic achievement. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial in which ninth-grade classes (14-year-olds) are randomly assigned to treatment or control within schools. Twenty-seven schools participate in the project, comprising 84 classes in the ninth grade in the school year 2021/2022, totaling 2,146 students, of whom we received parental consent forms from 1,968 students. The treated classes participate in a social-emotional learning intervention called ``Robust.'' Robust is a learning program that supports students' social-emotional learning in secondary school and includes teacher training prior to the intervention. We will investigate the effects of Robust on social-emotional learning (i.e., social relationships, mindfulness, problem-solving skills, emotion regulation, and growth mindset) and academic achievement (i.e., test scores) post-intervention and one-year follow-up. We also conduct a comprehensive implementation and process evaluation during the implementation year to understand why or why the intervention is not effective."
