abstract: "The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) is responsible for the delivery of the Census of Population and Housing (the Census) every five years. Historically, a single ‘night of enumeration’ has been highlighted as the point in time to complete the Census. However, the ABS has always permitted early and late completion of the Census. To provide responders with greater flexibility and encourage greater participation, ABS/BETA conducted a test to advise responders they have a number of days to complete the Census, giving them a ‘response window’. We will deliver a two-arm cluster randomised trial to evaluate differences in the framing of a ‘response window’."
