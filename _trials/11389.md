abstract: "Parental involvement and self-regulated learning skills (motivation, self-control, and metacognitive skills) are fundamental for children’s development and their success at school. However, socially disadvantaged parents may underestimate their potential contribution to their children’s success. Their parenting skills may also differ in terms of how well they manage to improve self-regulated learning skills. Therefore, in this study, researchers investigate the impact of an intervention for first graders’ parents in Priority Education schools to help them support their child in her schooling. Parents will receive text messages with links to videos providing parents with information and guidance on how they can foster their child’s self-regulated learning skills. The goal of this study is to provide empirical evidence on how parental attitudes may affect children’s academic learning through improvement in self-regulated learning skills."
