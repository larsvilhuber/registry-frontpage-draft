abstract: "Stereotypes about economics (and economists) profoundly shape who chooses to study the subject both in school (at age 16) and at university (at age 18) and are a key factor in explaining the lack of diversity in who studies the subject. Our assumption is that, in the absence of these stereotypes, more young people would be interested in studying economics. This project will deliver in-school outreach sessions to people who have never studied economics with the aim of challenging prevailing stereotypes.

The outreach sessions (the treatment) will provide information on what economics is about, and what types of jobs you can do with an economics degree. They will emphasize the subject’s breadth and real-world relevance. The treatment also involves a role model in the form of a current economics student (an economics “champion”) who will deliver the information. The role model will have a direct effect of challenging the stereotype of economists and a reinforcement effect on the information treatment by making the session more engaging. We will test the effect of the sessions on perceptions and intentions and, later, on subject choices.
