abstract: "This study addresses the potential impact of an Educational Robotics (ER) workshop on the development of executive functions and socioemotional skills, as well as neurobiological correlates, in children from vulnerable environments. Based on the premise that these skills are crucial for academic and social success, longitudinal research is proposed with 94 fourth-grade children, divided into intervention and control groups. Through pre- and post-intervention evaluations over the course of a school year, we seek not only to examine the immediate effects, but also to better understand their sustainability over time. In addition, the analysis will be complemented with administrative data to obtain a more complete perspective of the results. It is expected that this study will provide solid evidence on the effectiveness of RE interventions in vulnerable contexts, as well as relevant insights for the design of public policies and educational programs aimed at improving the comprehensive development of children at risk.
