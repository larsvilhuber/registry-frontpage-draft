abstract: "Entities devote substantial energy to pressured sales of merit goods with the conviction that purchase stimulates usage. This method backfires if marketing pressure screens in individuals with a low propensity for usage. Through a field experiment in India promoting chlorine water treatment tablets as the merit good, we show that selling a second good alongside the merit good doubles usage by alleviating pressure and introducing a positive framing effect. We also show that the price of this second good matters, as a promotion can reintroduce pressure and undo nearly all of the usage gains induced by framing."
