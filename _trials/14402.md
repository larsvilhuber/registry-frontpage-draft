abstract: "Background: Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder effecting up-to 8-13% of women during their reproductive age. Along with health-related concerns, PCOS impacts the emotional and psychological well-being of individuals, leading to symptoms such as body image concerns, low self-esteem, and psychological distress related to physical symptoms (Azizi & Elyasi, 2017; Dewani et al., 2023). In addressing these challenges, the effectiveness of coping skills emerges as a crucial factor. Effective strategies, such as problem-focused coping, can mitigate stress and enhances quality of life (Morshedi et al., 2021), whereas maladaptive strategies, like escape-avoidance are linked to increased psychological distress, greater interpersonal sensitivity and social difficulties (Ding et al., 2021). Despite incredible advancements in treatment of endocrine disorders, little is known about causes and consequences of PCOS, which limits our understanding of its psychological management. To address this gap, the present study will provide insights into CBT-based intervention for PCOS and examine its effectiveness.
Objectives: The study will focus on managing psychological distress and developing effective coping skills (primary outcomes); and improving body image, self-esteem, interpersonal sensitivity and PCOS related quality of life (secondary outcomes). 
Research Design: Young women diagnosed with PCOS (N= 46) aged 20-39 years will be recruited for the study. The study will be a randomized controlled trial, therefore, the participants will be divided equally into an experimental group (N=23) and a waiting list group (N=23). The study will be divided into three phases; pretest, intervention, and post-test. Participants in both groups will be administered in the pretest and post-test. However, the intervention will be given only to the experimental group. The participants (N=46) will be asked to fill Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995), Brief-Coping Orientation to Problems Experiences Inventory (Carver, 1997), Body Self-Image Questionnaire Short-Form (Rowe, 2005), Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1997), Interpersonal Sensitivity Measure (Boyce & Parker, 1989) and Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome Quality of Life Scale (Williams et al., 2018) during pretest and post-test. The intervention phase will comprise of 12 sessions which will be divided across 6-weeks,and will be a CBT-based intervention plan. 
Statistical analysis: IBM-SPSS-26 will be utilized to assess the efficacy of a CBT-based intervention plan for both primary and secondary outcomes. The study will employ t-test to confirm the study hypotheses.  
Anticipated Results & Significance: The study is expected to show significant improvement in psychological distress and coping skills among women with PCOS after CBT-based intervention, with positive effects on secondary variables. These results will provide empirical evidence supporting role of CBT in managing PCOS, promoting holistic treatment approaches that address both the psychological and physical aspects of PCOS"
