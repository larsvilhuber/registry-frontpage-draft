abstract: "Female labor force participation (LFP) rates are far below male LFP rates worldwide, and this gap is especially wide in India. There is much policy interest in promoting womenâ€™s employment, both worldwide and in India in particular. Intra-household bargaining has been hypothesized to be an important determinant of women's employment. This project will use a randomized control trial to test how improving communication skills for women impacts intra-household communication, bargaining, and female labor force participation. "
