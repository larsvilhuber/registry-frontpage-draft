abstract: "Together with a large chemical company, we survey the majority of employees in the majority of countries the company is operating. We ask employees about their current job situation (whether they work from home or not) and questions regarding e.g. their satisfaction, their current relation to their supervisor/employees/co-workers and their evaluation of working from home. Our main aim is to study how employees’ satisfaction, engagement, commitment, self-reported productivity, and supervisor-reported team productivity correlates with the intensity of working from home. If possible, we will exploit exogenous variations in the intensity of working from home (e.g. through policy measures). We plan to investigate heterogeneity in the response to working from home. Furthermore, we are interested in the connection between the intensity of working from home and stress levels, relationships with colleagues, and relationships with supervisors. We also survey supervisors’ ability to manage direct reports, and which work aspects employees perceive to be better at home versus at the office."
