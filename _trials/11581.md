abstract: "The main objective of the survey is to elicited preferences for policies that will reduce noise levels from traffic and improve air quality with a positive effect on people’s health. A minor objective is to elicit preferences for travel time and traffic safety using the same survey format. Discrete choice experiments (DCE) using hypothetical scenario will be used for the elicitation of preferences. Hence, it is a stated-preference survey where no real decisions are made. To complement the DCE, questions about respondents’ living situations, for instance if he/she is living close to major roads, etc., and travel habits will be asked. The findings from the survey have the potential to be used for policy purposes, like cost-benefit analyses of transport investments."
