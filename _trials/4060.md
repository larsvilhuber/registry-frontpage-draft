abstract: "In this trial we plan to investigate the sharing of fake news. We address the following questions. (1) does fact-checking (i.e., providing corrective information) limit the sharing of fake news? (2) if so, what drives the decrease in sharing, image concerns or moral costs? (3) do characteristics of the sharer affect the sharing decision  of the recipient? This will be done using a randomized survey experiment where participants will be randomly exposed to fake news with and without fact checking. The experiment will be conducted in the context of the European elections in May 2019."
