abstract: "In urban areas, traditional retail markets are essential for food accessibility, yet the sector remains largely informal with individual sellers sourcing goods independently. This study explores the barriers to cooperative behavior among retailers in Bouaké, Cote d'Ivoire, and investigates how a new organizational structure could improve cost efficiency and profit margins. A survey of 750 retailers across Bouaké's 12 neighborhood markets revealed that individual sourcing leads to high transportation costs, constituting 50% of total expenses. While consolidating orders could reduce these costs through shared transport and bulk discounts, misconceptions about cooperation and the social costs of forming new links hinder collective action. Pilot tests indicated that external monitoring facilitated cooperation, but retailers were reluctant to maintain these practices independently. This research intends to test the frictions that prevent organizational reform, through a randomized-control trial by testing an informational treatment and meeting and monitored purchases. This approach could also improve labor opportunities for women, who dominate the retail workforce, thereby contributing to broader socio-economic development."
