abstract: "We conducted a 6-week intervention in a Principles of Economics course at a leading Chinese university with first-year undergraduate students. The findings suggest some differences in responses between male and female students. Female students appear to show increased engagement with economics, including heightened communication with peers, while male students exhibit a more moderate change in similar aspects. "
