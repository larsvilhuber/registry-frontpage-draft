abstract: "We study the production decisions of managers in an experimental Cournot market as a function of the ownership structure of the experimental firms. In this trial, we focus on the role of communication between the shareholders and the managers. This trial is related to previous trials (AEARCTR-0006817 and AEARCTR-0008810).
In our experiment, there are two firms, managed by two managers and owned by two shareholders. Managers choose production quantities. The price in the market depends on the total production of both firms. Subjects play the experiment for multiple rounds. Each shareholder owns either 100% of a single firm and 0% of the other firm (separate ownership) or 50% of each firm (common ownership). Different ownership structures lead to different incentives for the shareholders. With separate ownership, shareholders get the highest payoff if managers maximise their firms profit whereas with common ownership, they get the highest payoff if managers maximise industry wide profit. We want to observe if communication can help shareholders to influence managers to produce the optimal quantity, given the ownership structure, in the absence of financial incentives for managers to do so.
