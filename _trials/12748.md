abstract: "This study presents a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the impact of a business training program implemented by Balloon Latam in rural communities of the Araucanía region in Chile. The program aims to strengthen entrepreneurial skills among excluded populations from the formal labor market, with a focus on women-led micro and small businesses.

The RCT will evaluate the effectiveness of the program’s training, which combines the transmission of proven business practices and soft skills such as personal initiative, self-confidence, self-control, team leadership, and negotiation skills. The program also includes a motivational component, aiming to find the purpose and impacts of the business, and a social linking component, serving as a tool for networking, motivation, support, and even social pressure toward fulfilling each business’s goals. In this component, participants are incentivized to pitch their businesses to other entrepreneurs in the program and build business relationships with them.
The initial sample will be randomly divided into three groups: a control group, which will not receive any intervention, and two treatment groups. The first treatment group (T1) will participate in both stages of the training (learning basic and advanced topics), while the second treatment group (T2) will only participate in the first stage of the training. Both groups will enjoy networking events, which will be further reinforced during the second stage of the program.

The study aims to expand current knowledge by generating evidence about the role of strengthening the soft skills of entrepreneurs when these skills are trained in conjunction with the teaching of practical application tools for business development and they are given opportunities to make use of these soft skills to make and maintain relationships with other entrepreneurs. The study also seeks to identify high-potential businesses (gazelles) and determine whether the interventions work better or worse with them. The results of this RCT will contribute to the understanding of what works to empower women entrepreneurs, especially in a rural context.
