abstract: "This research project is focusing on understanding information frictions in Ethiopiaâ€™s urban labor markets. We work with the Government of Ethiopia and a private employment service provider to field two interventions that aim to provide jobseekers with information about (i) job vacancies in their labor market and (ii) job search behavior of other jobseekers in their labor market."
