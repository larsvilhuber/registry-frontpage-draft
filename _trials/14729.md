abstract: "In this trial, we hope to study the impact of human AI collaboration modes on worker experiences and work quality. The research context is individual workers collaborating with a generative AI agent such as ChatGPT to perform professional writing tasks. The study will be posted as a survey on online platforms such as Prolific. We will study three collaboration modes of no AI, AI first, and human first, as well as the nature of the task (e.g., writing a report to a client vs. writing an email to co-workers) and the sentiment of the task (e.g., positive vs. negative). We will observe how these factors interact with one another to affect worker experiences and work quality. We will also examine heterogeneity among workers and how workers with different backgrounds react similarly or differently to the various task scenarios. "
