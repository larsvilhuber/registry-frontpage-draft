abstract: "Military conscription is a common national policy worldwide. It has direct consequences for its participants but could also cause externalities to participants’ relatives. Given the detrimental effects of traumatic experiences and the potential for intergenerational transmission, it is important to understand the unintended consequences of military conscription. I exploit the random variation in military service created by Argentina’s conscription to understand its effects on the mental health of conscripts and their children. Conscripts are called to serve at 18 years old, leaving their homes, separating themselves from their community, and involving in physically and mentally demanding training. This happens at an age when people are more susceptible to the effects of trauma, which has been associated with poorer mental health. Using survey data, I will estimate the effect of military conscription on mental health, specifically anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. I will also study the effect of having a father who was military conscripted on children’s mental health. "
