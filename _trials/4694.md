abstract: "The share of fathers taking parental leave in Germany has been steadily increasing since the introduction of the so-called “daddy-months” in 2007. However, the vast majority of fathers who take parental leave only takes two months, whereas most mothers take 12 months. There is some evidence from qualitative studies suggesting that fathers fear disadvantages in the labor market if they take leaves longer than two months. These disadvantages may arise due to the violation of social norms regarding the gendered division of work and due to the signaling of lower productivity due to family orientation. We study the impact of parental leave-taking on employment opportunities of fathers and mothers using a field experiment."
