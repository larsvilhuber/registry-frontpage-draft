abstract: "Our study will provide the first estimates of elasticity of climate concerns with respect to beliefs about the near-term impacts of climate change. In addition, it will provide important evidence on the socio-economic determinants of environmental preferences in Germany. The results will help design efficient measures to mitigate climate change."
