abstract: "Despite the importance of high-stake judicial decisions on litigants' wellbeing and economic development, there is little evidence on how to improve judicial performance. In this paper, we use a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of teacher monitoring and social-emotional exercises on the performance of judges and prosecutors in Peru's Judicial Academy. We test the impact of our interventions on both soft and hard skills that aim to improve not only educational attainment and social-emotional skills, but also contribute to fairer and more efficient judicial decision-making.
