abstract: "The main goal of this study is to understand whether individuals might prefer to avoid situations where they have to engage in sabotage, both as a saboteur and as a possible victim of sabotage. Specifically, this study looks at whether individuals might be willing to give up some expected payment to avoid engaging with sabotage and whether this willingness might differ across individual demographics (gender) and characteristics (altruism). This study will also look at whether the willingness to sabotage, and preferences for competition (with or without sabotage) differ across these same characteristics (i.e., gender and altruism) in its ancillary analysis."
