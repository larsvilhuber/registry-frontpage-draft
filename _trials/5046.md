abstract: "We test a theoretical model by Gennaioli and Tabellini (2019) on identity and polarization: when a new political dimension becomes salient, individuals choose new identities along this dimension and, due to a postulated tendency to stereotype both in- and out-groups, individuals shift their beliefs and attitudes in the direction of new stereotypes. This mechanism yields a clear prediction for polarization: an increase in the salience of one political dimension should lead to more polarized beliefs and attitudes along this dimension, while at the same time leading to less identification and reduced polarization along non-collinear, now relatively less salient, political dimensions. To test this prediction, we conduct an incentivized online survey experiment in which we randomly split participants into three groups: 1) control (C), 2) redistribution (R), and 3) openness (O). To vary the salience of a particular policy dimension, we expose each group to a different simulated news feed based on recent real-world news items from online media outlets. As outcomes we measure stated as well as revealed attitudes and beliefs about redistribution and openness (immigration, globalization, and climate change) to capture ideological as well as affective polarization.
