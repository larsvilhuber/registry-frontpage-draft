abstract: "The goal of this paper is to estimate the implicit price of carbon that people apply in their consumption decisions, which we call the Moral Cost of Carbon (MCC). We use an artefactual field experiment to recover a distribution of the MCC among a target population. We also investigate whether particular information treatment could impact the MCC. In this study, our focus is to identify sources of heterogeneity across domains, specifically food versus transport, in the distribution of the MCC. "
