abstract: "Remittances, i.e., money sent by migrants to family and friends, are a key pillar of economic development.  Organizations such as the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the World Bank have thus argued for increased transparency and reduced transaction fees via remittance-comparison platforms, i.e., sites like kayak.com but for sending money.  This project assesses to what extent (1) information provided through such platforms impacts remittance choices, e.g., by breaking habits; (2) information affects the alignment between choices and stated preferences, potentially impacting welfare; and (3) migrants' visual attention (measured through eye-tracking) moderates the relationship between choices, information, and possibly, welfare.  In so doing, this project (i) sheds light on potential reasons for why take-up of comparison platforms has remained low and (ii) contributes to a growing literature on behavioral development.  While the data for this project have been collected, they have not been analyzed.  So, the purpose of this registration is to discuss (1) how the study was designed/implemented and (2) what analysis will be done (see enclosed pre-analysis plan).  Departures from the planned analysis will be identified as part of the research paper and/or a populated pre-analysis plan (Duflo et al. 2020)."
