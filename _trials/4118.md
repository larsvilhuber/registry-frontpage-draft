abstract: "We mailed brochures to 10,000 randomly chosen employed German workers in small and medium-sized firms eligible for a subsidized occupational training program called WeGebAU. We informed them about the importance of skill-upgrading occupational training in general and about WeGebAU in particular. Using survey and register data, we estimate effects of the information treatment brochure on awareness of the program, on take-up of WeGebAU and other training, and on subsequent employment.
