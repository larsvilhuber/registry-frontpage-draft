abstract: "Low fertilizer use in sub-Saharan Africa contributes to low crop yields and poverty. Extension services advise the use of fertilizers but may not recommend fertilizer types that address prevailing soil deficiencies, potentially resulting in the perception that fertilizer is not profitable. This randomized control trial tests how fertilizer recommendations based on farm-level soil tests interact with the ability to finance fertilizer to influence fertilizer application and crop yields."
