abstract: "Many social scientists and policy makers express concern over low levels of college completion and poor overall academic performance. One explanation, drawing on recent insights from behavioral science, suggests that youth often overemphasize the present or rely too much on routine.  Another, drawing on social-psychology, suggests incoming students with weak academic identities (perhaps due to being a first generational or international student) struggle in transitioning to their new environment.  This study explores ways to counter these tendencies using online exercises and electronic messaging.  Randomly selected students at a 4-year college are randomized into three treatment groups and a control.  The first group is given an online goal-setting exercise to think about their future and what steps to take now to help them achieve their goals.  The second group is offered additional electronic messages containing advice, information, motivation, and reminders, with the aim of improving performance, experience, and completion. The third group's online exercise involves reading through past 'testimonials' how previous students struggled with their college transition yet persevered and were successful.  "
