abstract: "Public preferences for charging tuition are crucial for determining higher education finance. To test whether public support for tuition depends on available information and design features, we devise several survey experiments in representative samples of the German electorate (N>19,500). The electorate is divided, with a slight plurality against charging tuition. Providing information on the university earnings premium raises support for tuition by 7 percentage points. The opposition-reducing effect persists two weeks after treatment. Information on fiscal costs and unequal access does not affect public preferences. Designing tuition as deferred income-contingent payments raises support by 16 percentage points, creating a strong majority favoring tuition. The same effect emerges when framed as loan payments. Support for tuition decreases with higher levels and increases when targeted at non-EU students."
