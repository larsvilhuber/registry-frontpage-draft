abstract: "Recent work posits that poverty lowers cognitive function (Mani et al. 2013), but evidence for behaviors in the field is lacking.  If true, this has the potential to lower labor productivity among the poor, providing a channel through which poverty could directly reinforce itself.  We design an experiment with piece rate manufacturing workers to examine a link between financial constraints and worker productivity.  We induce variation in both the extent of financial constraints as well as their salience among workers.  "
