abstract: "We partnered with Locales Conectados, a Chilean NGO, to conduct a cash transfer experiment in Bogotá, Colombia. The main treatment consists of direct cash transfers via SMS to low-income households, who can use these digital funds to purchase goods at local mom-and-pop stores that are onboarded by the NGO. The research design comprises two treatment arms that affect both sides of the market: 1) on the demand side, random qualifying neighborhoods will receive the SMS texts while the control neighborhoods will not, and 2) on the supply side, some treatment neighborhoods will have many onboarded stores, as opposed to only a few in the other treatment arm. The idea is not only to measure the impacts that direct cash transfers have on the welfare of households (using surveys), but also to understand how firms adjust their prices upon this highly-localized liquidity inflow, and how competition might attenuate the latter adjustment."
