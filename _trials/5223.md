abstract: "VDSSâ€™ commitment to triumphing over poverty extends beyond the direct anti-poverty programs we administer with our local partners to include free tax prep sites and performing outreach for the federal and state Earned Income Tax Credits (EITC). The EITC has been shown to a very effective policy tool for lifting people out of poverty, and promoting it is directly aligned with our mission. VDSS is statutorily mandated to conduct annual EITC outreach to our customers who are likely eligible. In a 2006 finding by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission that only 13 percent of VDSS customers who were eligible for the EITC in 2003 claimed it. The impact of VDSS' current outreach is unclear. The proposed study intends to conduct a randomized control trial to test the effectiveness of different types of texts on tax filing outcomes. Our theory of change states that providing customers relevant, needed information (i.e. location/access to tax preparation services, amount of estimated refund) through communications channels they regularly use (i.e. text messaging) will directly influence their decision to file and claim the EITC. Therefore, we hypothesize that sending our customers text messages related to the EITC will have a statistically significant impact on the number of people who file taxes and claim the EITC. After contacting all identified customers we plan to compile responses, use those responses to understand which method of communication is most effective in getting our customers to file their taxes and claim the EITC, and improve our outreach plans.
