abstract: "This study investigates the prevalence and dynamics of vote-buying in Mongolia’s 2024 elections using a list experiment to address social desirability bias, a common challenge in measuring sensitive behaviors. Vote-buying, a form of electoral corruption and a criminal offense in many countries, undermines democratic processes by distorting voter choices and perpetuating inequality. The primary objective is to estimate the prevalence of vote-buying, while secondary outcomes focus on identifying demographic and behavioral patterns among voters. The study employs stratified random sampling, targeting 1,200 respondents aged 18 and above. By exploring these dynamics, this study offers recommendations for democratic governance and social equity.  "
