abstract: "Residential battery storage is a relatively new technology and little is known about the motivations of potential adopters. This study analyzes the effects of messaging used in community battery storage campaigns (PowerSmart campaigns) in Connecticut. Town governments in Connecticut who have agreed to participate in a PowerSmart program are randomly assigned to “self-sufficiency” or “fossil-fuel-free” messaging as a part of a PowerSmart campaign in their town or to serve as a control.
