abstract: "Evidence from different disciplines, including behavioral economics, psychology, and political science, suggests that conversation-based interventions could reduce prejudice against out-groups at least in the short term. In this study, we compare the effects of two conversation-based interventions, perspective taking, and value consistency, on reducing anti-Muslim bias in a randomized control trial. We implement this trial in the metro Detroit area â€“ home to one of the largest Muslim population in the United States. We measure the impact of the interventions and two to three months afterward. Particularly, we measure whether these interventions increase trust beliefs and behaviors towards two groups, Muslims, and non-Muslims using the investment game as an instrument. Measurements taken immediately after the intervention suggest that (1) value consistency increases trust beliefs and behaviors in both Muslims and non-Muslims; (2) perspective taking marginally increases trust behaviors in Muslims compared to non-Muslims and improves beliefs about the trustworthiness of Muslims; and (3) the combination of a hijab-wearing canvasser and a Muslim partner increases behaviors indicative of trust in Muslims. While not as strong, our results are in line with Broockman and Kalla (2016) results that suggest perspective taking reduces prejudice against transgender."
