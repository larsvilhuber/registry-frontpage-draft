abstract: "In this paper, we implement behavioral interventions to reduce teacher sorting (e.g., good teachers choosing the best schools). We test, in the context of teachers' school choice, the effect of two behavioral theories/effects well-established in the literature of psychology: the name-order effect and cognitive dissonance. In a large-scale countrywide intervention put in place in Ecuador we use the online platform that teachers use to select the schools to which they would like to apply to teach to implement two low-cost experiments. In the first arm, we prime altruism by asking if they would like to work in a school in which they think they could have a bigger social impact. We then label those schools and let them choose. A positive response to the treatment question would be inconsistent with choosing a less-impactful school. In a second arm, we order the schools to show first the schools in which they could have a bigger social impact to test a name-order effect on their choices. Our main outcome is the likelihood of choosing disadvantaged schools.
