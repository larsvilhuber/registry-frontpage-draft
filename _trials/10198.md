abstract: "The adoption of new agricultural technologies and improved farming practices are key elements of structural transformation and drivers of increased productivity in agriculture (Bustos, Caprettini and Ponticelli, 2016). Yet agricultural productivity remains far below its potential in many Sub-Saharan African countries. Our project investigates whether an innovative approach to provide technical information, consisting of agri-edutainment (educational entertainment) programs broadcasted on national television, can help to meet the informational needs of farmers. Two key distinguishing features of TV programs are that (i) they can easily convey information also to populations with relatively low literacy levels, and (ii) they are easy to distribute at scale at low marginal cost compared to traditional extension services. TV may also be a particularly useful medium to mitigate gender gaps in access and effectiveness of traditional extension services, to the extent that TV viewership is less gender-imbalanced than access to other services. Prior market research in Kenya indicates that a “makeover style” reality television show focused on farming as business helped to boost farmer incomes at a cost of only $0.50 per viewer. We leverage the planned rollout of this television program to Uganda (in 2022/23) to measure the causal impact and cost-effectiveness of the show in diffusing recommended techniques, and to better understand the process of information transmission and learning in agriculture.
