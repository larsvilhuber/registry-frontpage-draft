abstract: "We conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment in Colombia to study how non-monetary incentives may influence worker productivity in a dynamic setting when they work for an employer with Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Workers work on a real-effort task. We introduce CSR by informing the workers that the employer will donate to a local charity five percent of their variable earnings in the task. In addition, we vary across treatments the degree to which the workers could voice their opinion on CSR. We examine how the introduction of CSR and workers' choices affect their productivity and its changes over time. "
