abstract: "While downsizing in firms may be necessary for growth in a dynamic economy, layoffs are often discussed controversially in the general public and in the media. A significant amount of psychological literature suggests that downsizing creates costs associated with a decrease in work morale and motivation of those who remain employed in the company. This phenomenon is called “survivor syndrome.” To analyze the survivor syndrome, we conduct a field experiment in which subjects work in a natural work environment, and in which layoffs can be implemented in randomized manner. Subjects perform a telephone survey at a call center, which we rent for several weeks. The main output variable is the number of calls made. Between our treatments we vary the information that we provide to the non-fired subjects about the layoffs of their co-workers. To study heterogeneity in subjects’ reactions to layoffs, the field experiment will be followed by an online experiment that produces a measure of subjects’ direct and indirect negative reciprocity.
