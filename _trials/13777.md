abstract: "In various contexts, such as shopping, experimentation, and problem-solving, agents engage in dynamic trial-and-error search processes. They decide both where to search and when to stop before choosing from a set of available options. We investigate how behavior changes with the complexity of the search problem. To this end, we design a controlled lab experiment where participants uncover positions with unknown prizes, paying a search cost for each revealed position. We vary the complexity by restricting the possible prizes at different positions and telling participants about these restrictions."
