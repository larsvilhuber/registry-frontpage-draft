abstract: "Recent advances in the economic literature find that people don’t consider opportunity costs when making decisions. This is in contrast to economic theory, which assumes people consider the costs of missing the benefit of the next best alternative when making a decision. However, the literature also points out that explicitly showing opportunity costs helps individuals to take them into consideration. While the positive effect of making opportunity costs explicit has been shown in consumer market research, there is no literature in the field of higher education. Against this background, we will test two different information treatments with students from 21 different study programs. One informs them about future earnings and the other one points out the opportunity costs of long study durations. "
