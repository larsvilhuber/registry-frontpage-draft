abstract: "For a country to survive a conflict, more is needed than just military and financial resources. Amongst other things, individual citizens needs to undertake a variety of behaviours that involve helping others. These may range from helping vulnerable individuals evacuate to picking up groceries for neighbours who cannot leave their home. While it has been found that prosociality typically increases amongst citizens in conflict zones (Voors et al. 2012; Guriev Melnikov 2016; Bauer et al. 2016), an unsurprising lack of data means that there is little causal evidence on the determinants of prosociality in a conflict zone. We conduct an online survey experiment during the 2022-2023 Russian full-scale invasion in Ukraine to provide such evidence for one particular determinant of prosociality, the salience of ally support in a conflict."
