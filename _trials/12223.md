abstract: "This experiment will test whether people can be taught a better way to negotiate. In the experiment, two parties will be tasked with allocating a nominal amount of cash between themselves. The two parties have an opportunity to invest together and thereby earn a greater amount of interest than if they each invest separately. The question is: how will they split the proceeds? There is a typical default solution where parties agree to a proportional split of value created (based on the relative amounts invested). Instead, we believe an equal split of the extra value created better represents a fair solution and one that aligns with the equal contributions of the two parties--even though they may be different in size. The basic idea is explained in this video (https://tinyurl.com/BNYALEIRB) At the big picture level, we want to test the extent to which a new framework for negotiation leads to a different outcome. At the more granular level, we want to see how much coaching is required to achieve this result. This leads us to consider four potential interventions: (1) No coaching . (2) General introduction to the pie framework (similar to the video) but no specific information to the case at hand. (3) General introduction to the pie framework (similar to the video) along with a specific application to the case at hand. (4) General introduction to the pie framework (similar to the video) along with a specific application to the case at hand and an example where proportional division hurts the larger player. "
