abstract: "In this project, we develop a novel revealed preference approach to test for and quantify labor rationing. In addition, we provide evidence on the two components of rationing: involuntary unemployment and disguised unemployment (also referred to as "forced entrepreneurship"). The setting for our test is rural labor markets in Odisha, India, which mirrors other poor rural settings: seasonality from subsistence agriculture leading to low employment levels for much of the year."
