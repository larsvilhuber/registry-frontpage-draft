abstract: "Educational attainment is a key determinant of health and economic outcomes. The period of late adolescence is a critical period of development when changes in educational processes can have dramatic consequences over the life course. However, despite major progress made in primary education, only around 40% of adolescents reach the last grade of lower secondary school in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) today. Average educational attainment remains lowest among women in SSA, particularly in central and western SSA.

The primary objective of this project is to identify the most effective strategies to reduce these disparities and to improve secondary school attendance. Building on the key insights and recommendations of the 2020 Global Education Evidence Advisory Panel, we will conduct a pilot study with at least about 15 (out of 25+) secondary schools in Nouna, rural Burkina Faso, which has one of the lowest secondary schooling completion rates globally. The study setting is representative of many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where secondary school enrollment is persistently low, and increasing access to secondary schooling is a major national policy objective.

Through a randomized pilot study, we will assess the feasibility and potential impact of three interventions, including:

(i) economic support and incentives;
(ii) tailored tutoring to support learning;
(iii) providing information on the economic and health benefits of secondary education;

We expect that the findings of our pilot study can guide the development of future schooling interventions to reduce the wide existing disparities in education and health outcomes often originating from adolescence. In addition to that, we hope that the findings can be translated into practical guidance for governments and other stakeholders seeking to promote schooling in LMICs.
