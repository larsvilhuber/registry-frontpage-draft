abstract: "Women-only options in digital marketplaces have emerged as a response to an amplified need for safety in the interaction between men and women. These designs remove the uncertainty about the identity of the user's counterparts, and by doing so, they limit the possibility of undesired events. As such, women-only options aim to improve female users' experience and encourage their participation. In one of the largest digital platforms for long-distance carpooling, this project will study the effects of rolling out a women-only option on the participation and usage decisions of female drivers and passengers. The study is planned to consist of three independent interventions that randomize (i) the possibility of choosing the women-only feature for female drivers, (ii) the awareness of the availability of the women-only feature, and (iii) the display of the women-only badge to female passengers.

The first intervention aims to answer three questions. What are the characteristics of women drivers who value the women-only mode the most? How does the availability of this feature change other trip characteristics (asked seat price, automatic booking)? Approximately, how does the introduction of the women-only mode affect the participation decision of female passengers in the presence/absence of alternative transportation means (i.e. buses)?

The second intervention analyzes the intensive and extensive margins of female user participation: how many more trips are posted/booked when the user is aware of the mode? How many more users become active on the platform? 

The third intervention aims to quantify the value that female passengers have for the women-only feature. As such, it answers the question: how much is a female passenger willing to pay for a women-only trip? How are the participation and welfare of female users affected when the women-only feature is available?"
