abstract: "We examine how to nudge administrators in local governments to evaluate grant applications from nonprofit organizations from long-term perspectives, not short-term ones. Prior studies show that there are two effective ways for nonprofits to win grants: A) providing information about outcomes of service programs such as short-term and long-term outcomes, and B) providing information on service efforts such as accounting efficiency. However, evaluators are more likely to highly evaluate short-term outcomes than long-term outcomes because of their high time-discounting rate in behavioral economics.

We conduct a field-based survey experiment toward 1,916 local governments in Japan. We randomly divide the local governments into four groups. We set in the survey a hypothetical question, where the survey respondents are asked to evaluate the contents and quality of grant applications from two non-profit organizations: one with good short-term outcomes and the other with good long-term outcomes. The four groups consist of three treatment groups and one control group. The three treatment groups add to the latter nonprofit organization the information on A) accounting efficiency, B) social comparison nudge, and C) both. After the hypothetical question, we ask administrators in the local governments to rate the grant applications from the two nonprofit organizations and make a decision on which application is more suitable for acceptance. We also investigate whether the effects are heterogeneous by local governments’ and administrators’ characteristics."
