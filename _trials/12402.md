abstract: "We study the extent author’s affiliation can bias reviewers in grading papers submitted to international conferences. We exploit a PhD Workshop in Economics arranged by local PhD candidates. Our objective is to investigate the extent to which author affiliation can introduce bias in the evaluation of research. Affiliation is often used as a signal to form beliefs about research quality (Blank 1991). We test whether signals can potentially be misinterpreted and exacerbate inequalities across researchers from differently ranked institutions.

We define affiliation bias as any difference between blind and non-blind assessments for each submission. This conference welcomes extended abstracts only. We remove from all submissions information on title, authorship, acknowledgments, and indications of preliminary work. For each submission we prepare a blind and non-blind version. Abstracts prepared for blind grading also have authors’ affiliations removed. Submissions prepared for non-blind grading keep the affiliation of the submitter visible. Every submission gets read by at least one blind and one non-blind reviewer. Grading is based on peer-reviews, with applicants to the conference rating submissions and providing grades. We will randomly assign reviewers to either the blind or non-blind assessment groups. The assignment of reviewers and submissions will follow a multiple stage randomization procedure.
