abstract: "We evaluate the impact of a safe spaces program (MAS) for married adolescent girls in Northern Nigeria using a village-level cluster randomized trial. The program uses biweekly meetings with trained and supervised mentors to directly educate girls, as well as to provide support on interacting with institutions and encourage the use of birth spacing methods. We will assess the program's effects on a variety of health and empowerment-related outcomes."
