abstract: "Common-pool resources (CPR) such as fish stocks, hunt and aquifers are not necessarily spatially restricted to one country or management area. In many cases the resource is mobile and can freely move between areas. As a consequence the extraction of a resource in one area can affect the abundance of the resource in other areas. This spatial externality can cause inefficient management and create tensions over use rights, in particular when centralized management is not feasible and several owners manage the resource unilaterally. Here we outline a theory informed lab experiment, with the aim of improving our understanding of the behaviors and biases of decision makers in these mobile common pool resource dilemmas (Mobile-CPR). 

In this project we have two general research questions. First, to what extent does extraction behavior in the lab differ from the derived theoretical predictions, and second, what mechanisms cause these potential differences. More specifically we aim to disentangle the role of other-regarding behavior, the spatial strategic interaction and confusion on the extraction levels of decision makers and their divergence from the equilibrium strategies."
