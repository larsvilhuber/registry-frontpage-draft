abstract: "Green electricity contracts, where electricity is produced through renewable sources or where emissions are compensated, are becoming widespread. Utilities often offer this type of contract as a default for new customers. However, customers are not always fully aware of this characteristic. We aim to investigate whether disclosing or recalling customers the green component of their contract has a rebound effect on their electricity usage. Customers may react to such information by increasing consumption levels, as the moral cost of consuming a resource that produces little negative environmental externalities may drop. We also investigate a way to counteract a possible boomerang effect. In particular, we leverage the salience of the current energy crisis and the importance of energy transition. For the sample of customers with non-green contracts, we instead investigate how leveraging salient topics contribute to increasing energy conservation. We collaborate with an Italian utility which adopted a social information program for electricity. We randomly modify the contents of the Home Energy Report that customers regularly receive, adding a treatment that discloses the benefits of green energy and /or a treatment that emphasizes the importance of energy independence and the ecologic transition."
