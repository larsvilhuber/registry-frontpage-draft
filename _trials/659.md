abstract: "In order to increase quality of care, all regions in Sweden have during the last decade implemented systems where users can choose their primary health care provider, and where there is freedom of establishment for providers. All primary health care units are financed by public means and pre-set user fees, but may be privately or publicly run. For user choice systems to improve the functioning of health care, users must choose health care units that deliver care of relatively high-quality. Previous studies indicate that a very large share of users in Sweden do not compare the quality of providers before making their choice of provider. The transaction costs related to information retrieval and switching present a possible obstacle to the functioning of this market: the gathering of information about and comparison of providers is costly in terms of time, and there are also (small) process costs related to notifying providers of the change. In this study, we provide three randomly drawn samples of the population in the region of Skåne with information about the quality of primary care providers, to see whether this freely available information affects their propensity to change provider, and the type of provider they choose. The first sample is representative of the whole population in the region (above 18 years of age),  the second consists of individuals that have recently moved to the region, and the third sample consists of families that are expecting children. We also examine if lowering the process costs on top of providing free information affects the choice frequency, and whether the effects differ for groups defined by for example socioeconomic background and health status."
