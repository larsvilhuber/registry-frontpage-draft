abstract: "Economic decisions and productivity suffer when cognitive resources are limited. Recent papers have shown, for example, that productivity is reduced when poverty consumes mental resources (Kaur et al. 2023). We test whether political constraints impact economic outcomes through similar channels. In particular, we experimentally examine whether a minority’s uncertainty about their status within a nation generates psychological effects comparable to those generated by financial concerns. We test this with a labour market experiment in West Benga and online throughout India. Workers complete data-processing tasks and we randomize incidental exposure to two types of exclusionary policies—policies that pose a direct, material threat and policies that pose a more symbolic threat. We test whether exposure to both types of policy affects productivity and cognitive outcomes."
