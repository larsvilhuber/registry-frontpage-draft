abstract: "The Ultra Poor Graduation Pilot in Ethiopia is a part of the CGAP/Ford Foundation global initiative, currently being implemented in eight countries, that combines safety net programs with entrepreneurial activities to develop a graduation model for the poorest households. In 2010, we conducted a baseline survey on 1000 ultra-poor households in 10 villages in Tigray, Ethiopia. The households were identified by a community level Food Security Task Force. Public lotteries were held in each village in order to randomly select 500 households (50 per village) to receive the intervention. The treatment households received an intensive support package including: livelihood trainings, productive asset transfer, consumption support, savings plans, and healthcare. By investing in this multifaceted approach, the program strives to eliminate the need for long-term safety net services. Two follow-up surveys were conducted in July 2012 and 2013."
