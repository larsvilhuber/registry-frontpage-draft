abstract: "The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the lives of people around the world: governments have imposed lock-downs, many people have already lost their main source of income and millions face the risk to fall sick to the virus. We use a survey experiment to investigate how personal experiences during the corona pandemic affect beliefs about the determinants of economic success and preferences for redistribution. "
