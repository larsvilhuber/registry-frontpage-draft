abstract: ""Nudges" have increasingly shown to be cost-effective tools for promoting a wide range of behaviors, from medication adherence to saving to energy efficiency. But most research evaluates one intervention in isolation on target outcomes. As such, we have little understanding of how campaigns might interact with one another, or whether they generate spillovers in unanticipated domains. This paper explores the hypothesis that such campaigns might interfere with one another due to limited attention. I propose a simple framework, motivated by a taxonomy of attention from the psychology literature that distinguishes between “internal” and “external” attention. I test the predictions of the framework using an experiment in which individuals receive combinations of messages and incentives for two healthy behaviors. "
