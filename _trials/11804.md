abstract: "Sample surveys are an effective tool for collecting microeconomic data on the population. Despite the many advantages of such data collection, it is often the case that selected groups of respondents systematically refuse to complete questionnaires. Previous research shows that this is particularly true for high-income groups and individuals with high social status. Such non-participation of important groups of individuals may lead to underestimates of income or wealth inequality. In the experiment, we aim to test whether the pre-announced provision of monetary gifts (such as a voucher and a silver collector's coin) can motivate otherwise hard-to-reach household groups to participate in the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS). The experiment will be conducted as part of the fifth wave of the HFCS survey, which the National Bank of Slovakia and the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic plan to conduct in autumn 2023. The results of the experiment should be useful for the design of representative surveys, which should not miss high-income and wealthy household groups in their samples."
