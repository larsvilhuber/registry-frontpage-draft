abstract: "Prior research has suggested gender differences in negotiation outcomes, particularly when parties are advocating for themselves in a distributive negotiation context. On average, male negotiators walk away with significantly more value than female negotiators. Two possible explanations for this phenomenon have been suggested. On the one hand, women may behave differently (e.g., less assertively) in negotiations and thus obtain inferior outcomes. On the other hand, negotiators may behave differently (e.g., more assertively) towards women, leading to inferior outcomes for them. To parse out these explanations we conduct an experiment in virtual reality. Participants are assigned avatars of their true or the other gender, while assuming that they and their negotiation partner are in fact represented by an avatar of their true gender. This allows exploring gender differences in own behavior and in the other party’s behavior towards each gender. Behavioral differences will be tracked all along the negotiation process (initial offers, concession rate, negotiation outcomes)."
