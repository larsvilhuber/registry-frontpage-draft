abstract: "Economic studies often use years of schooling or average enrolment rates as measures of education, even though these readily available measures tend to be very noisy and aggregate a variety of distinct elements. However, recently, the focus has shifted towards the direct measurement of cognitive skills â€“ one of the main skills that we aim to teach students in school and university (Finn et al. 2014; Hanushek and Woessman 2008). 

Our research project aims to tackle these aforementioned problems in a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). First, we plan to induce random variation in improvements to cognitive and non-cognitive skills by teaching a specifically designed course to university students as part of their education. Our focus will be whether the intervention affects students' health behavior. We plan to offer undergraduate students a mandatory semester-long course to improve their cognitive skills. We will randomly assign students to one of three experimental groups: (i) a treatment group receiving a cognitive (analytical) skills course, (ii) a second treatment group receiving a non-cognitive (soft) skills course, and (iii) a pure control group. We will measure health behavior using surveys and lab-in-the-field experiments. "
