abstract: "This project capitalizes on an opportunity to redesign a centralized labor market match to address questions related to improving personnel management in bureaucracies and improving national unity. The program, Greatness United (G-United), places Kenyan university graduates in primary schools around the country to improve student learning and boost national cohesion, but the program suffers from high levels of volunteer attrition. This evaluation aims to understand how the range of individuals’ geographic preferences can be used in civil servants’ assignments, and if incorporating these preferences can lead to better performance and increase retention. By incorporating participants’ idiosyncratic preferences into placements for a random subset of participants and schools, the evaluation will explore how such a system helps or hinders the various goals of the program, including improving learning outcomes and strengthening national unity (as measured by inter-ethnic prejudice, the relative strength of ethnic vs. national identity, and national pride)."
