abstract: "This project investigates how preference misperceptions confound the identification of time preferences from state-varying choices. To this end, I run an online longitudinal experiment with multiple sessions in a stylized environment with unpleasant effort tasks, where participants at different stages of mandatory work can forgo payoffs to avoid (or equivalently, require compensation for) additional work at a different point in time."
