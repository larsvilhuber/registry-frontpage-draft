abstract: "What people perceive as the norms or attitudes in society affects important behavior. The authors document misperceptions about gender norms with nationally representative data, covering 80% of the world population. In this study, we are additionally interested in studying beliefs about more direct peer groups, such as fellow citizens at the state level or coworkers. Do individuals also hold incorrect beliefs about their more direct peer groups? Is information about national support levels relevant for how individuals form beliefs about their peers?"
