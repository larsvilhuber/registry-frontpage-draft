abstract: "Theory predicts that exponential-growth bias, the tendency to neglect compounding interest, will lead to suboptimal saving decisions.  In previous work, we show that this bias is prevalent and explains a meaningful amount of heterogeneity in retirement wealth accumulation.  In this project, we aim to investigate an intervention meant to target this bias via a field experiment at a large employer.  Our results will provide evidence as to whether this intervention affects retirement savings through the hypothesized mechanism by analyzing the heterogeneity in responses with respect to underlying measures of exponential-growth bias.  These interventions could serve as an important proof of concept for future interventions that lead individuals to make better-informed retirement saving decisions."
