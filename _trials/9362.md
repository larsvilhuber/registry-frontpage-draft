abstract: "We partner with an Earned Wage Access (EWA) fintech company to run a survey-based experiment through their app. EWA technology gives workers access to their wages as they are earned, rather than having to wait until payday. EWA serves as an alternative to high-interest forms of short-term credit (e.g., payday loans) and predominantly caters to lower-wage, hourly workers.

Our experiment seeks to answer three questions: (1) Can workers accurately predict how many hours they will work in the future? (2) Can workers accurately predict how much pay they will advance in the future? (3) How much of a role, if any, does misprediction of work hours play in misprediction of pay advanced? Our survey collects workers’ beliefs about work hours and pay advances. Using workers’ actual hours and pay advances, we can answer the first two questions. We develop and employ two treatments in order to answer the third.
