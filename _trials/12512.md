abstract: "We conducted a lab-in-the-field experiment in Colombia to study how climate change may influence gender differences in the negotiation of wages.  Workers negotiate their wages before working on a real-effort task. We introduce climate change by taking advantage of the presence of El Nino from 2023 to 2025, which harms agriculture in the Altiplano region of Los Andes, Colombia. In addition, we vary the degree of employability in the area: workers negotiate wages during high and low seasons for tourism (employability). We introduce two negotiation treatments by varying who offers the initial wage offer, the worker (forced negotiation) or the employer (choice negotiation). We examine how introducing different types of negotiation and using the negative impacts of El Nino affect the gender gap and workersâ€™ productivity and its changes over different times of employability."
