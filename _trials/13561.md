abstract: "There is a culture of silence around sexual harassment. Victims usually refrain from speaking out about their experiences and bystanders generally do not intervene or voice concern. We study how traits of stories about sexual harassment affect people’s attitudes about victims' and bystanders' silence. We test our predictions in survey experiments within the Norwegian Crime Survey.  "
