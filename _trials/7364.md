abstract: "We conduct a large-scale randomized field experiment to study whether providing information about the costs of a high-stake real decision can improve the quality of the choices made. Besides simply providing relevant cost information at face value, we conduct two additional treatments, where we either present the same information in terms of real opportunity costs, or by administering the information via a quiz to ignite deliberation. We find that providing cost information substantially affects the choices made, and reduces the decision mistakes, in particular in the two additional treatments."
