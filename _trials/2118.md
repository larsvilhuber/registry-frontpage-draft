abstract: "Supporting labor market participation is crucial to improving economic outcomes for the millions of Americans trapped in poverty, yet existing job-readiness training programs focused on developing job-search skills have failed to substantially improve labor market outcomes for the chronically unemployed. We evaluate the impact of a new workforce development program, Transforming Impossible into Possible (TIP), a promising alternative modeled on group social work practice. TIP empowers workforce development clients with the necessary psychological capital – self-awareness, confidence, hope, goal-orientation, leadership, accountability, conscientiousness, grit – for overcoming stubborn employment barriers and achieving long-term success. Through a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) implemented across three workforce development agencies serving unemployed Chicagoans facing multiple employment barriers, we measure the impact on employment outcomes of the new TIP program as compared to existing skills-based job-readiness training  programs currently offered at the agencies.
