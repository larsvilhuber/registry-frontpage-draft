abstract: "Reading skills are an important predictor of educational attainment and, consequently, of other long-term outcomes. School curriculum often follows the “one size fits all” rule, which means that every student within a classroom is assigned the same reading materials, regardless of their reading skills. This practice potentially leads to adverse effects for students in the extremes of the reading abilities’ distribution, which is particularly negative for those falling behind. In this project, we test an alternative system to select reading material for early grade readers: we build a web-based platform that gives book recommendations tailored to readers’ abilities and interests; participants can borrow books for free at the community library. We also test whether parental involvement could complement this strategy. We implement a randomized control trial to assess the potential benefits of this intervention on students’ reading proficiency and habits.  "
