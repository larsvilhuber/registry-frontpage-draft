abstract: "Given the high prevalence of mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, in pretrial detainees, the Swiss Federal Justice Department (SFJD) approved a model trial. The model trial will be carried out in 11 pretrial detention facilities in the cantons of Zurich and Bern and aims to improve the wellbeing and social reintegration of individuals in pretrial detention. 

As part of the model trial we are evaluating the impact of two interventions using a randomized controlled trial. The first intervention, “Prison Stress Management” (PRISMA), addresses the issue of poor mental health of inmates during pretrial detention and after release. The second intervention (SOCIAL) uses proactive social services to address potential disruptions (e.g., in employment, social relations, and housing situation) incarceration might cause in detainees’ social and economic lives.
