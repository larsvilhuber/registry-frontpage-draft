abstract: "This research is designed to understand whether monetary incentives can be used to create a habit of savings.  The study population consists of 600 market women in Tamale, Northern Ghana.  Several recent studies suggest that women similar to those in the study population are willing and able to save, but that they face challenges in reaching their savings goals.  Studies have also shown surprisingly large impacts from programs that facilitate savings.  The psychological literature suggests that habits guide the behaviour of many people, and that there is potential for habit formation to help people to reach goals that they find difficult, for example, because of self control problems.  While there are many ways to think about forming habits, most are information and time intensive.  Providing incentives for the repetitive performance of particular behaviours is among the cheapest and least information intensive options.  This work will explore three main issues:  first, can an experiment be designed that can discriminate between the two key possibility --  that incentives are sufficient to create a habit, or that incentives alone cannot create a habit; second, are incentive complementary to other potential avenues for promoting habits; third, what is the role of consistency and repetition in habit formation; and fourth, what population characteristics determine whether or not it is possible to form a habit?  The study will also consider the welfare impacts of habit formation, if indeed it is possible to form a habit in the study population."
