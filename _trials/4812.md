abstract: "We develop an experiment designed to shed light on the role of meditation in influencing the role of two behavioural biases often studied in economics: heuristic biases and self-control problems. For newcomers to meditation, we conjecture that it may influence these two types of bias through its effects on attention and presence. Our RCT design makes use of one treatment that targets these dimensions and one active control (sessions devoted to general stress-management) to analyse the effects of meditation on these two domains of decision-making (measured using experimental methods on an online platform)."
