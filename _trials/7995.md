abstract: "The public transport system is responsible for a third of daily trips in Bogotá, on par with the other most common travel mode: non-motorized mobility. Traditionally, the system's fare policy aims to cover its operational costs. Nonetheless, targeted subsidies to low-income and elderly users and the city administration's decisions to halt planned fare increases have produced a financial deficit of approximately US $ 220.2 million in 2017. These decisions aim to improve the user's welfare since transportation costs account for a significant share of most people's income in Bogotá. Nonetheless, limited evidence exists on how this translates into mobility increases, overall reductions in transportation costs, or if any gains in income or other welfare aspects are produced. This study aims to provide better evidence in this regard by randomly selecting a group of 1,600 personalized-card users of the BRT system that do not already have a subsidy and subsidizing half of them with 30 to 40 trips for four months. During this period, their BRT system usage is recorded. Additional information on their transport use and welfare decisions is recorded using a baseline and an end-of-intervention survey."
