abstract: "In three sections of a large undergraduate course, we will collect data on online homework completion and visits to TA help sessions. In two treated sections, students will be required to visit TA help sessions at certain points of the semester. We will study how the treatment increases students' visits to TA sessions, number of assignments turned in on time, and course grade outcomes."
