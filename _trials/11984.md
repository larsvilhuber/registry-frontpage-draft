abstract: "The first step from a position without team responsibility to a managerial position is a key bottleneck in women’s career progression. Evidence reveals that women are reluctant to apply to first-level leadership positions which come with the responsibility to lead a team. This experimental study investigates i) the potential gender gap in the preference for becoming a leader whose main task is to communicate with the team and ii) whether exogenously exposing subjects to the leadership experience reduces this potential gender gap. Furthermore, it is investigated how different stereotypes related to the leadership role as well as how positive and negative experiences shape the effect of the leadership experience on the future application behavior for such a role. The results of this experiment can help to understand whether and why exogenously exposing employees to leadership experience can increase the number of (female) applicants for leadership roles and thus decrease the gender representation gap in these kinds of positions."
