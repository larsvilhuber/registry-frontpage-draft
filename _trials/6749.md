abstract: "Many households lack the liquidity to cover unexpected expenses, periods of unemployment, and other financial shocks. We are interested in learning more about ways to help households set money aside for these scenarios. By building up savings to weather negative shocks, households could achieve not only increased short-term financial security but also increased retirement security. However, many behavioral biases make it difficult to save. Employers can help workers overcome these biases by offering emergency savings accounts alongside traditional retirement accounts. 

We are planning a two-arm trial to evaluate take-up, participation, and utilization of an after-tax 401(k) account -- framed as an emergency savings account -- among employees of a large US-based employer. Employees will be randomized into passive and active choice arms. The employer's 401(k) plans, including the after-tax option, are managed by Voya Financial."
