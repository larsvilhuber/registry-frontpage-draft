abstract: "Information and narratives have been suggested as drivers of public opinion and triggers for major economic events. Opinion-based and factual information impact public opinions differently, with literature suggesting that echo chambers exist on various issues. We aim to explore three main questions: 1) whether individuals informed that their opinions will be shared are more expressive of their views; 2) whether beliefs differ when individuals receive factual information versus different types of opinion-based information; and 3) how identity interacts with individuals’ belief-updating processes. This experiment investigates whether reality aligns with theory in the decision-making of real agricultural producers.

We will conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment at the 2024 Canada’s Outdoor Farm Show (COFS) in Ontario, Canada. Subjects will be asked several belief-related questions regarding weather and soil changes, followed by a charitable giving question and preference elicitation for a soil test using a Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) mechanism (Becker et al., 1964). The outcome variables of interest will be farmers’ beliefs, charitable giving, and bids on the examined products under various between-subjects treatments.
