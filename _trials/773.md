abstract: "In India alone, it is estimated that 3.5 million people suffer from Tuberculosis. The under-detection of TB represents a key challenge for health officials in developing countries because the success of any treatment program rests crucially on identifying those who have the disease. We propose to evaluate an approach with the potential to augment and strengthen the WHO’s global strategy for community engagement in the fight against TB. We will explore the use of financial incentives to encourage referrals, and we will focus on a specific community group with unique potential to generate referrals; current patients under treatment for TB. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare the effects of different types of financial incentives to encourage TB patients to refer people from within their social networks for TB screening and testing. We will vary the conditionality of the incentives (“unconditional” and “conditional” incentives), the method of outreach ("peer-to-peer outreach" or "provider promotional visits") and whether the new suspects know who named them (“known referrer” and “anonymous referrer” conditions).
