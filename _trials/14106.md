abstract: "Child marriage is prevalent in many developing countries. One of the most adverse and irreversible effects of child marriage is teenage pregnancy, which poses detrimental effects on girls’ health and educational achievement. Given the prisoner’s dilemma situation of child marriage in South Asian countries, helping girls prevent teenage pregnancy is likely to be the best pragmatic support to enhance their welfare. In this context, with the aim of preventing teenage pregnancies, we implement an intervention under a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that provides reproductive health education by community health workers to adolescent girls aged 13–17. We target rural Bangladesh, where 71% of girls aged 20–24 marry before the age of 18, with these marriages typically arranged by parents, and 49% give birth during their teenage years. In addition to delaying the first pregnancy, we expect the following outcomes from the intervention: (1) minimizing the school dropout rate and helping girls continue education at the secondary and higher levels, (2) improving the level of knowledge regarding reproductive health, and (3) enhancing the decision-making capacity and autonomy of the girls within the household. This study will contribute to global efforts to decrease teenage pregnancy and improve reproductive health knowledge and practices."
