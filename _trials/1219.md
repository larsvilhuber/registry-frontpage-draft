abstract: "Climate change threatens the livelihoods of millions of households in arid and semi-arid lands in developing countries. Rain-fed agriculture and mixed farming systems are the dominant form of crop production in semi-arid and dry regions the world over. However, as the planet warms, monsoon rains have become less reliable. Small farmers in dry areas are left vulnerable to unpredictable rainfall, reduced soil fertility, and depleted water tables. Their response is to draw more heavily on streams and groundwater, rapidly depleting these natural resources. As evidence mounts for the effect of climate change on social and ecological systems, policymakers need tested methods of effective water management to help communities adapt and manage their natural resources.  
	
Building off a prior funded baseline data collection effort, the proposed IGC research project represents the midline data collection and analysis for a rigorous and innovative impact evaluation to meet this need. The study uses a randomized control trial (RCT) to measure the impact of an intervention that creates village institutions to manage water use across seasons and leverage government programs to improve irrigation infrastructure. The intervention is implemented by the Foundation for Ecological Security (FES), an Indian nongovernmental organization, in the semi-arid regions of the Indian states of Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh.

The study is the joint effort of research investigators at the University of California (Santa Cruz), the Cloudburst Group and FES. In Indian villages, water is a communal resource that requires collective management. The intervention creates quasi-governmental village institutions to manage surface and ground water by setting and enforcing rules to protect the resources. Members of these institutions are trained in how individual and group decisions can either conserve or deplete water. By strengthening governance, the intervention aims to overcome the collective action problem of making farmers choose crops and growing practices that, though more difficult, will conserve water. The intervention also trains members of these committees to design and manage projects to build irrigation infrastructure using labor paid for by India's National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGA).

An RCT is used to assess the impact of the intervention. FES randomized its intervention across 132 villages, 82 of which are treated and 50 of which are untreated. Baseline household data were collected in late 2014 and early 2015. The treatment began in each village following baseline household data collection. IGC funds would be used to (1) run a midline panel household survey in October – December 2016, (2) conduct a village survey, and (3) measure the short-term impact of the intervention and identify the channels of impact for the following outcomes of interest: 
o	Improved natural resource governance
o	Greater availability of water 
o	Differential impacts on women
o	Resilience to climate change
o	Food security 
o	Women’s empowerment 
o	Income

The evaluation results from the study will be:
(1)	used by FES to inform and improve the program as it is rolled out to hundreds more villages; 
(2)	shared with regional government stakeholders in Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh;
(3)	published in academic journals."
