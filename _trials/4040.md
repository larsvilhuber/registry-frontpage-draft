abstract: "The broad research agenda which includes this pilot RCT aims to examine the behavioral explanations for why women are underrepresented in highly competitive and male-dominated fields of study and subsequent careers like finance, economics, and technology.  The pilot will inform us on how best to design the full RCT aimed at helping capable and interested female students persist in their major and career tracks.  Using experimental methodology, we will investigate the way in which gender differences in perceptions of and reactions to information can lead to differences in persistence in competitive environments. The RCT will be conducted at an undergraduate institution and will gauge the effects of feedback combined with targeted information about past outcomes on the subsequent decision to pursue one's proposed major or career, particularly in STEM fields where women tend to be underrepresented.  Building upon our previous results from a controlled online experiment, the field experiments will shed light on how behavioral traits and short-term decisions can drive long-term real-world educational and other economic outcomes."
