abstract: "We run a large randomized eld experiment with a major news outlet in Germany to study the economics
of articial intelligence in the case of online news. We ask whether automated recommendation can
outperform a human editor in terms of user engagement, and how this relationship depends on the amount
of personal data that is available to the algorithm. In particular, we want to assess the economic returns to data for an algorithm.
 We then investigate the unintended consequences of personalized recommendation, including potential changes in the distribution of news consumption across
article categories."
