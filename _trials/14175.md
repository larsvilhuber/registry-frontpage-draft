abstract: "In this study, we investigate the spillover mechanisms of cheating by conducting an incentivized online experiment. In this experiment, the participants worked in pairs on tasks that benefited from cheating. We investigate the extent to which one of these participants becomes more likely to behave honestly as the other participant becomes more likely to behave honestly. We focus on introducing commitment devices that can eliminate the option of cheating in advance. The introduction of commitment devices curbs tempting behavior–in this case, cheating. By randomly dividing participants into a treatment group with a commitment device and a control group without it, we estimate the effect of introducing commitment devices on curbing the chain of cheating. Furthermore, we estimate the extent to which participants’ beliefs about their partner’s dishonesty while performing the cheating task influences the creation of a cheating chain."
