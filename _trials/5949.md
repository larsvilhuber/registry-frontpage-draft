abstract: "We measure physical activity, time use, and well-being in a sample of college students that we have been following since February 2020. Participants received wearable trackers that monitored their physical activity and sleep before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. Participants also filled out surveys aimed at capturing their time use and mental health. We find substantially higher rates of depression and anxiety following the onset of the pandemic. The rise in depression is greater among students with larger changes in lifestyle during the pandemic, especially among those with greater declines in physical activity. In this study, we will attempt to increase physical activity by randomly assigning students to receive incentives to walk, and test the effect of this intervention on mental health. "
