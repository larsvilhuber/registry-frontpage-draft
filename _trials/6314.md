abstract: "Early stage investors often evaluate startup candidates for investment in highly uncertain environments, where decision outcomes are non-obvious and the majority of startups will fail. Most scholarship has examined how investors work with startups post investment, rather than how investors select startups. Yet this selection process is important as evidence suggests that equity investors concentrate their investments on startups led by white, male founders in California. This is problematic not only for talented diverse founders from elsewhere, but also for any investor concerned with missing promising investment opportunities. Scholars suggest that differences in context can shape which startups are considered or valued, but little is known about the process by which early stage investors evaluate the investment worthiness of deals and the ramifications of these processes on investment decisions. Without this understanding, it is difficult to assess how evaluation processes can be changed to include consideration of more diverse types of founders. How do investment organizations source, evaluate and value early-stage investments? How does this shape the diversity of the founders they consider? We will conduct field experiments with professional and trainee investors to assess the effect of changing two evaluation practices on investment decisions.
