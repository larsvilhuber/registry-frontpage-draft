abstract: "This trial measures the impact of the delivery of information about accidentability to SMEs in their implementation of labor security practices, participation in trainings and their accidentability rates. Four different treatments were applied which differ in the kind of information given, the way it is delivered and to whom it is directed (entrepreneurs, security managers or directly to the workers). The enterprises in the experiment are part of the SME Program of the Chilean Security Association (ACHS) and they had all been visited by the ACHS´s expert the month before de intervention.
