abstract: "Social norms about who is deserving may help target public benefits, by making sure people in need receive benefits or by excluding people with lesser need to reduce program costs. The Government of India launched a campaign to use norms to improve the targeting of a cooking gas subsidy used by 220 million beneficiary households. The campaign, called Give It Up, asks beneficiary households to voluntarily forfeit cooking gas subsidies so the money can be used to subsidize the poor instead. We propose a field experiment to test the efficacy of self-targeting as a policy instrument and to measure whether the campaign induces spillovers in giving across households. The main policy outcome, usage of the cooking gas subsidy, is measured with high-quality administrative data in a sample of 1.2 million gas-using households. The cluster-randomized design will provide the first experimental estimates of the strength of spillover effects in charitable giving.
