abstract: "I study the effects of implementing a management routine at randomly chosen sewing lines within garment factories in Bangladesh, to obtain evidence on the sources of observed productivity spill-over within factories. Bangladeshi garment factories are organized into several sewing lines which produce independently from another for different orders and buyers. Sewing lines producing garments that have already been produced by other lines in the factory before, are significantly more productive in the first days producing the new garment. Initial analysis by the author shows that these `spill-over' effects are stronger when the supervisors on the first and later lines to produce the garment report social ties in surveys. This intervention is designed to obtain additional evidence on the sources of the observed spill-over. Several garment factories agreed to implement a new management routine among randomly selected sewing lines. If a selected line start producing a garment that has already been produced on another line in the factory, the line supervisor from the first line producing the garment is actively involved in setting up the new line for the garment. If this intervention magnifies observed productivity spill-over, this would be indicative for spill-over being caused by sharing of knowledge between supervisors from the lines, as opposed to superiors or other persons (engineers, planners) applying their knowledge obtained on earlier lines producing the garment to later lines producing it, or other possible confounding sources.
