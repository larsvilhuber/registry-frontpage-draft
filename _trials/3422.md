abstract: "Loss aversion is widely studied in the monetary domain as well as with respect to material goods. However, little is known about its relevance in the non-material domain. We plan to conduct a laboratory experiment to explore whether the concept of loss aversion applies to social image concerns, a non-material good. Social image concerns are important in an individual decision-making since people typically care about their reputation. We plan to analyze whether an exogenous improvement or harm to one's reputation follows the same pattern as gaining and losing money or material goods. Our experimental design attempts to quantify the effect of loss aversion in social image concerns via the scope of lying."
