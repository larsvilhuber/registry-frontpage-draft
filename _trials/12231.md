abstract: "We explore the role of emotions such as guilt-aversion and shame-aversion, and of social/workplace norms in the determining effort choices of team members. We build a rigorous beliefs-based model to derive predictions in four different treatments that isolate the effects of various emotions and social norms. Participants will be asked to choose the amount of effort they wish to exert in a team project, while being aware of either their team partner’s effort expectations (private signals), their social group’s effort expectations (social signals with and without sanctions), or a combination of both expectations."
