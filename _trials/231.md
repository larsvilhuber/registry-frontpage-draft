abstract: "In South Africa, the lack of parental involvement in their child’s education is largely due to the significant barriers to participation that parents face, which include: linguistic and literacy barriers, logistical constraints (many parents commute long distances to work), and social barriers (as working-class parents may feel discouraged by the bureaucratic jargon and hierarchical frame of the education system). Increasing parental involvement has been widely touted as a means of overcoming the difficulties of low attendance, and poor quality learning which plagues many classrooms. However, it is still not clear whether parental involvement programs are a direct cause of children’s success, or whether these programs simply selectively attract parents who are already motivated to be engaged in their children’s success. Can parental involvement be used as a lever to improve educational outcomes in underprivileged areas of Port Elizabeth, South Africa?"
