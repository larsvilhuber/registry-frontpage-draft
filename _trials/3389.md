abstract: "How can judicial decision-making and legal processes be improved? Judicial decisions are a public good vulnerable to underinvestment by judges, thus eroding the rule of law and delegitimizing the state’s enforcement institutions. Evidence of such problems exists in Kenyan magistrates’ courts, an ideal context for understanding the malfunctioning of judicial processes.  We propose two interventions, creating public scrutiny of magistrates via courtroom monitors and providing administrative support for magistrates via case clerks, designed to improve the quality and efficiency of Kenyan magistrates courts.
