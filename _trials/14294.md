abstract: "We conduct a correspondence test in the housing market to determine the effect of premium accounts that affect information salience on ethnic discrimination and the role of visual stereotypes. We send fictitious applications with a randomly assigned Turkish- or German-sounding male name to vacant room ads. We randomly select half of the applications to be send from subscription-based premium accounts, which prioritize applications in the advertiser's inbox. Moreover, a link to a social media profile is randomly added to determine the effect of personal social media information on callback rates. Half of these profiles display visual stereotypes that signal religious beliefs and cultural orientation and were previously utilized in a similar study (AEARCTR-0011322). The aim is to extend the previous study, which already included a (limited) number of premium applications (an opportunity that arose during the course of the previous study), with a second wave to increase statistical power."
