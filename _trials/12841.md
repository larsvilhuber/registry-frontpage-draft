abstract: "The optimal policy in a wide array of areas turns on how one weighs benefits to earlier and later generations or cohorts. Using an incentivized survey experiment, we infer respondents' intergenerational social discount rates and compare them to how respondents make decisions for themselves. Respondents allocate resources over time to people in different age cohorts. Respondents choose how many meals to the homeless and how much clean water will be donated now or in twenty years. We use these choices to estimate a social discount rate consistent with respondents' choices. Using a series of further choices, we study whether respondents' social preferences are consistent with the sort of social welfare functions typically used in economic analysis."
