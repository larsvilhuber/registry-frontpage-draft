abstract: "In the past decade, mindset nudges aiming to instill optimistic beliefs about the role of effort in success and enhance resilience to failure and setbacks have gained prominence in the field of economics. We test the effectiveness of an intensive growth mindset intervention implemented across 18 middle schools in rural China, with over one third of the participants experiencing parental absence. Through a carefully structured 6-week curriculum, drawing on validated materials from past experiments, our aim is to evaluate the effect of the intervention as an additional school input, examining how its impact would differ based on varying levels of parental input. We plan to measure the interventionâ€™s influence on the short-term and medium-term academic achievements of students, along with associated shifts in modes of thinking, disciplinary behavior, socio-emotional skills and future aspirations. Additionally, we will run supplementary experiments post-intervention to check whether the treated students are more likely to exhibit traits related to the concept they have learned.
