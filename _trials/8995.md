abstract: "This study examines how people's perceptions on the governmental roles of providing public goods and providing welfare policies affect their policy preferences for the government size. To this end, we conduct an online survey experiment where either the information regarding the governmental role of providing public goods or the information regarding the governmental role of helping the poor is randomly assigned."
