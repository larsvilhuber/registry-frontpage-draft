abstract: "Over the past twenty years, the gender gap in Bangladesh has substantially shrunk. Nevertheless, Bangladeshi women constitute the majority of the unbanked population, they maintain a low level of agency within the household and are excluded from income-generating activities. Stereotypes that depict women as unfit to work or to manage resources can reinforce social norms and make rules of the law or policies ineffective. If individuals form opinions through gender stereotypes that present women as not capable, then correcting these misbeliefs could reduce gender discrimination and improve women’s agency. 
I conduct an experiment across 42 rural villages in Bangladesh and I study women’s low agency as a result of imperfect information. Specifically, I investigate (i) whether women are discriminated against because they are deemed unskilled; (ii) whether women have a low willingness to be more involved because they believe the stereotypes; (iii) whether updating beliefs alleviates stereotypes and improves women’s agency. 
I test these hypotheses with an innovative incentivized decision-making game played by married couples: during the game, I update individuals' beliefs about women's abilities and I observe whether and how decisions change.  "
