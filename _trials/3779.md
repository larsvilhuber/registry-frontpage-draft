abstract: "Schools are an attractive leverage point for improving diets, thanks to their continuous and intensive contact with children and youngsters whose eating habits can be shaped and the high potential to reach adults through children. In Vietnam, several initiatives to promote healthier diets have taken place, but attempts to increase children’s motivation to eat healthier have been sparse and not been assessed to be successful. In Dong Anh, consumption of fruits and vegetables is suboptimal and overweight and obesity among children a worrying health consequence. This study will assess how school-based nutrition education will increase children’s consumption of healthy foods, and how this helps to increase the parents’ knowledge of healthy food, obesity, and healthy diets. We will implement two interventions: First, this research will provide children with the opportunity to learn about food and nutrition in the school meal setting, contrary to the usually detached nutrition lessons. The design of nutrition lessons incorporates insights from behavioral economic literature. Children will be encouraged to share what they have learned during the nutrition education sessions with their family members. Second, healthy snacks will be provided during the break of the treated children. The activity is designed in collaboration with the National Institute of Nutrition.  

The research employs a clustered randomized control trial. The study population are of 3rd, 4th and 5th graders from all primary schools in the Dong Anh District, out of which 12 schools will be sampled to participate in the research. The unit of intervention planned will be 3th, 4th and 5th grade classes within the schools. In each school (as a block), all the classes in one or two of the three grades (randomly selected from the 3 grades) will be in the treatment group, while all the classes in the remaining grades will be in the control group.
