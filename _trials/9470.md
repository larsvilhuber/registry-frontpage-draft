abstract: "The high prevalence of digital financial fraud makes it difficult for businesses to distinguish between real communications from digital service providers and fraudulent communication. This could lead to a lack of trust and usage in digital financial services. We test two strategies for preventing non-institutional fraud: an anti-fraud campaign and a technical intervention – a unique communications code – which verifies the provenance of messages sent from a digital platform. Using a behavioral laboratory experiment along with survey outcomes, we test whether anti-fraud campaigns increase the ability of MSMEs to distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate communications. Additionally, we test how confidence, trust, and usage of digital financial services respond to anti-fraud campaigns. Finally, we test that the deployment of the unique communications code is suitable for businesses using a follow-up experimental exercise."
