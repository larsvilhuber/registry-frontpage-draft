abstract: "Female labor force participation (henceforth FLPF) is very low in Saudi Arabia and social norms appear to be a constraint to female employment in the country. In the first round of our experiment, we surveyed groups of Saudi Arabian men and found that most men privately support female labor force participation while believing that others hold much more conservative views. At the end of the survey, participants were given a choice between a $5 Amazon gift card and the opportunity to sign-up their wife for an online job matching service. An information treatment showing randomly selected participants the distribution of true beliefs increased the likelihood that participants chose the job matching service sign-up, suggesting that correcting individual beliefs about others may be an effective way to encourage female labor force participation. The additional experiment aims to further examine the impacts of the information treatment on females’ labor supply decisions and their choices to work from or outside the home, when wives are directly given the information instead of the husbands.
