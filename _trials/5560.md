abstract: "The purpose of the proposed project “Social experiments of different kinds of counselling for newly unemployed” is to analyse and evaluate whether different types and intensity of counselling and coaching by Swedish PES caseworkers matter and can improve the employment opportunities of newly registered unemployed workers. This will be tested through a set of social policy experiments implemented within the PES organisation where newly registered unemployed are randomly assigned into treatment (intensive and/or a certain type of counselling) or control (regular counselling). The specific treatments involved are early and intensive individual counselling meetings between a caseworker and an unemployed; early and intensive individual distance meetings, either through telephone and/or online (e-counselling), between a caseworker and an unemployed; and early and frequent group meetings. The average treatment effects are likely to vary across individuals, i.e. they are heterogeneous, which motivates an investigation of differential impacts by gender, age, education etc. The design of the experiments enables us to conduct an evaluation of the different types of ALMP related to counselling. It also enables us to estimate their relative cost-effectiveness and to say something about displacement effects."
