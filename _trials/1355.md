abstract: "In many regulated markets, private, third-party auditors are chosen and
paid by the firms that they audit, potentially creating a conflict of interest. This
article reports on a two-year field experiment in the Indian state of Gujarat
that sought to curb such a conflict by altering the market structure for environmental
audits of industrial plants to incentivize accurate reporting. There
are three main results. First, the status quo system was largely corrupted, with
auditors systematically reporting plant emissions just below the standard, although
true emissions were typically higher. Second, the treatment caused
auditors to report more truthfully and very significantly lowered the fraction
of plants that were falsely reported as compliant with pollution standards.
Third, treatment plants, in turn, reduced their pollution emissions. The results
suggest reformed incentives for third-party auditors can improve their reporting
and make regulation more effective."
