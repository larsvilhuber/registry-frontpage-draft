abstract: "In this paper we study the effect of showing jobseekers information about the subjective well-being of incumbent workers.  We conduct a field experiment on a large jobs website.  We collect information on the happiness of firms' current and former workers, as part of the website's ongoing collection of review and ratings data.  We experimentally display aggregate company-level happiness levels to users on the site, and study the effects of showing this information on application decisions.
