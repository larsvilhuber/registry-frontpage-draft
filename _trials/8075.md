abstract: "As businesses and everyday life slowly return to pre-pandemic activity, one point is becoming clear: The home office isn’t about to shut down. In his research and discussions with hundreds of managers across different industries, Prof.Nicholas Bloom finds that about 70 percent of firms — from tiny companies to massive multinationals like Apple, Google, Citi, and HSBC — plan to implement some form of hybrid working arrangements so their employees can divide their time between collaborating with colleagues on-site and working from home.

Hybrid arrangements balance the benefits of being in the office in person — greater ability to collaborate, innovate and build culture — with the benefits of quiet and the lack of commuting that come from working from home. Firms often suggest that employees work two days at home, focusing on individual tasks or small meetings, and three days a week in the office for larger meetings, training, and social events.

We are conducting a hybrid WFH experiment at Ctrip, a 16,000-employee, NASDAQ-listed Chinese travel agency. Managerial and IT-professional employees who volunteered to WFH every Wednesday and Friday were randomly assigned either to exercise this hybrid working option or in the office for 6 months.
