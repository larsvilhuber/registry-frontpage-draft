abstract: "Many political and philosophical debates over in-kind provision emphasize “rights,” a form of non-welfarist preferences — for instance, “Right to Counsel” for indigent legal defense and “Right to Health Care.” We conduct online experiments that test for and quantify the presence of non-welfarist preferences over allocating legal counsel and health care to tenants facing eviction.
