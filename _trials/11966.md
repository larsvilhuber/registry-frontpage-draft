abstract: "In developing countries, where product labels and standards are particularly weak, dealers play an important role in informing customers about expected performance of durable goods and influence their purchasing decisions. Dealers can choose to promote high performing products to create more value for the customer and increase their repeat purchase probability, but can also choose to increase short term gains by spreading misinformation and promoting products with sub-optimal performance. We study the decision making of dealers through an audit study in the electric three wheeler lead acid battery market in Bangladesh. In a circular economy, as with lead acid batteries, the sale of used batteries by customers at volatile lead market dependent salvage value introduces new trade-offs between durability, information and
price decisions for the dealers that we also study."
