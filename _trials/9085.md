abstract: "In the three-year project "Fokus Arbeit" (Focus on Work) of the Social Welfare Department of the City of Biel, recipients of social assistance will develop professional perspectives together with other recipients in a group intervention, which should have a positive effect on their chances of becoming independent of social assistance.
 
Recipients of assistance will attend group workshops led by coaches for two to three half-days each week over a period of four to six weeks. A total of 12 half-days are required for the implementation of the program. In the workshops, the participants will develop vocational integration plans, which they can pursue independently during the rest of the week.

A total of up to 2640 study participants are expected, of which one in ten is assigned to the control group. The program will target individuals who meet all inclusion criteria without meeting any of the exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria are: Age of majority (18+ years), simple oral communication in DE/FR is possible, availability of at least 2 half-days per week. Exclusion criteria are: no childcare can be organized, working poor (80-100% employed), in education with no other capacity, severe health limitations (physical and/or psychological). No exclusion criteria are: Working on call, mild health limitations.

10-12 people will participate in each implementation group. Three groups will be conducted in parallel. The program will be conducted either in German or in French.
