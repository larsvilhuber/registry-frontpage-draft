abstract: "Incentive schemes are extensively used in firms and often contain various dimensions for a multi-tasking job. While the bonus structure might become more complex in design for an increasingly multifaceted task, recent evidence suggests that complexity leads to inefficient choices. It is important to understand how these complex bonuses can be communicated to ensure that they are effective and do not entail adverse effects. In a setting with a highly complex incentive system, we study two different ways of communicating such incentives and analyze the effects on effort choices and performance.
