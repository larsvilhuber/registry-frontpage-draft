abstract: "The study aims to use experimental evidence to determine whether strategic thinking can be learned from relatively brief information and how potential learning is related to cognitive ability and personality. The treatment group gets to read brief information on game theory and see a picture with text providing basic logic of strategic thinking. The test subjects are Finnish high school students who are at least 18 years old."
