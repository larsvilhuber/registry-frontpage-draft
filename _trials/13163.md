abstract: "In many U.S. states and around the world, regulations that require employers to post pay ranges in job ads are increasingly common. Often the stated motivation for these regulations is to improve labor-market outcomes for women relative to men. The goal of this project is twofold: First, it aims to discover whether differences in the size of pay ranges change the overall likelihood of accepting a job offer and the resulting worker performance. Second, the project aims to investigate whether women and men exhibit different behaviors. We conduct a randomized controlled trial using a large online crowd worker platform to study the potential impact of the size of pay ranges on a) the likelihood of accepting a job, b) the performance on the job, and c) the perceived deservingness and beliefs of the participants. We focus on gender differences in these outcomes. The treatments vary in the size of the pay range and the gender of the participants."
