abstract: "Can new technology be used to improve the quality of democracy by boosting citizen participation? In this paper we report on the VIP:Voice platform, which was constructed to allow South African citizens to engage politically through an ICT platform, to report on political events in their communities, and to monitor their polling places on election day. We sent out over 50 million 'Please Call Me' messages encouraging South Africans to register on the system, and provided a multi-channel platform allowing citizens to engage politically via low-tech mobile phones and high-tech social media. We find starkly different demographic profiles of users across channels, indicating that the success of efforts to overcome marginalization using ICT will be partially determined by the technological channel used. Attrition of users across each step in the engagement process is high, and while thousands of citizens are willing to engage in costly political actions based only on intrinsic motivation, extrinsic incentives induce large increases in participation rates. Using the platform, we were able to recruit citizen volunteers willing to monitor 12 percent of the polling stations in 38 percent of the wards in the country."
