abstract: "Graduation programmes such as BRAC's Targeting the Ultra-Poor (TUP) have traditionally focused on transferring resources and providing health services and training to recipients. The origin of these transfers is from outside the recipient communities: That is, the transfer of resources and skills is made from wealthier parts of the country (in the case of tax-funded programmes) or of the world (in the case of foreign donors) to poor members of relatively deprived communities. This traditional model does not attempt to change the way in which resources are distributed and help is mobilised within recipient communities. At the same time, increasing transfers may have unintended consequences if within-community private transfers and risk-sharing are crowded out. Motivated by these concerns, in 2016, BRAC trialed an intervention which attempts to leverage local knowledge and existing forms of informal social protection to improve outcomes for the recipients of their TUP programmes, or at the very least to off-set any possible crowding-out effects. They did this by instituting informal institutions called "village assistance committees" (VACs) in recipient communities. By exploiting random variation that was built into the programme roll-out (VACs were established in a randomly selected subset of eligible villages), we aim to evaluate the impact that these forms of informal institutions have on distributive outcomes, consumption, social inclusion, and overall living standards among TUP beneficiaries.
