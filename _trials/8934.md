abstract: "The economic inclusion of refugees is a challenge for host economy governments and development partners. While there is evidence that poor mental health can hold back the economic inclusion of refugees, little is known about potential low-cost and scalable interventions to overcome such ‘internal’ constraints, such as the effects of trauma on the ability to imagine the present or future. In this project, we use a survey among refugees in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and a randomized trial of a high-intensity psychological program on “positive visualization” to study the role of these constraints. We hypothesize that learning to vividly and precisely imagine a positive present or future and to contrast negative memories from past traumatic experiences can help refugees take steps towards improving their economic livelihoods in the host economy. To shed light on mechanisms, we use a cross-randomized priming intervention and hypothesize that “positive visualization” improves the economic choices of participants by reducing their perceived background risk of daily economic choices.
