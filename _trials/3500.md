abstract: "In a randomized survey experiment, we investigate how exogenously manipulated information sources affect people's beliefs about ethnic discrimination and their attitudes to ethnic minorities. In addition, our study examines from which sources people prefer to receive discrimination-related information. The experiment will be conducted with a large sample representative of the Czech population, and it has two waves. Subjects will be randomly divided into five subsets. In the first wave, three subsets of participants will receive information from one of three sources about local discrimination against a job seeker with an Asian-sounding name. The fourth subset of subjects (Control group) will see placebo information while remaining participants will be given an opportunity to choose one of three information sources. In the second wave (obfuscated follow-up), which will take place on average seven days after the first wave, we will assess the persistence of potential treatment effects on participants' beliefs and attitudes."
