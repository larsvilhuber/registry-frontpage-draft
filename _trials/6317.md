abstract: "We examine whether different types of frames increase individuals' compliance with cancer screening and vaccination. Making use of a large digital message customer journey held in Israel by Maccabi Healthcare Services, we design 5 treatments that differ in their theme and underlying appeal. The five treatments include: Positive framing (benefits of early detection), negative framing (risks of late detection), empowerment ("your health is in your own hands"), recommendation by physicians, and implementation intention. A control group receives a message that only describes the importance of the screening/vaccination and the fact that they are recommended by the ministry of health. The population includes adults between the ages of 50-74 and the targeted screenings and vaccinations are: Occult blood test, mammography, screening for early detection of abdominal aortic aneurysm, HPV and Pneumococcal vaccine."
