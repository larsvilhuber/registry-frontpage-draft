abstract: "This research project aims to shine light on the constraints hindering women farmers' adoption of technologies, access to markets, and entrepreneurship. We randomly assign 112 villages in Tete province in Mozambique to 3 groups. The first group receives an agriculture extension program. The second group receives both the agriculture program and a psychology-based personal initiative training. The third group receives neither intervention.
