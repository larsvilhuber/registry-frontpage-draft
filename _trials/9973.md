abstract: "Online misinformation is largely financially sustained via advertising revenue from ads placed automatically on misinformation websites by digital platforms. The financial motivation to earn advertising revenue by spreading misinformation has been widely conjectured to be one of the main reasons misinformation continues to be prevalent across various digital platforms. Despite attempts from digital media platforms to reduce ad revenue going to misinformation websites and the existence of tools that companies can adopt to avoid advertising on misinformation websites, ads from multiple well-known companies continue to appear on misinformation websites. We conduct randomized experiments to measure how people react to information about the role played by advertising companies and digital ad platforms in placing ads on misinformation websites. In our first study, we measure how consumption behavior changes when people receive different pieces of information about ads appearing on misinformation websites. Additionally, we measure whether people respond to our information treatments in other ways such as by voicing their concerns as well as by changing their attitudes, beliefs and preferences. Our second study is focused on measuring the beliefs, preferences and choices of employees and decision-makers within companies about ads appearing on misinformation websites. In addition to measuring the stated preferences, revealed preferences and baseline beliefs of employees and decision-makers within companies about ads appearing on misinformation websites, we measure how their behavior changes in response to the information provided."
