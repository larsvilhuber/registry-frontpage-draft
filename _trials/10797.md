abstract: "Our laboratory experiment investigates the influence, direct and indirect, that early movers have over later movers in a sequential move, binary action coordination game played on a network. Each subject is assigned to a particular node in a specified 5 or 10 node network, and chooses In or Out knowing which previous movers who are neighbors have chosen In. We measure potential influence by comparing the number of subsequent In choices following an initial In versus Out choice by a robot. We also measure the extent to which human subjects exploit their potential influence."
