abstract: "The impact evaluation seeks to evaluate the impact of the Farmer Field School (FFS) methodology of agricultural extension service provision and the electronic-voucher (e-Voucher) input subsidy system implemented by FAO in Mozambique. The FFS component seeks to i) understand and test different measures to strengthen the FFS model to disseminate information and empower farmers, and ii) evaluate initiatives to overcome the constraints faced by female community members to become FFS facilitators, as well as study the impact of facilitator gender on FFS outcomes. The e-Voucher component will assess the impact of e-Vouchers on the adoption of improved agricultural technologies and crop productivity, as well exploring which types of farmer benefit most from e-vouchers in the short and long run. In order to maximize program and policy impact, the IE will test varying subsidy levels and technology compositions early on to inform program implementation in subsequent years. The impact evaluation features a cross-randomized community beneficiary selection, enabling the evaluation of the impact of both programs individually and combined."
