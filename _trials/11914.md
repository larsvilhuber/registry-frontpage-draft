abstract: "Portugal experienced one of the largest housing price increases in the EU since 2015. In this study, we analyze the support for housing public policies and regulations in the context of the housing crisis in Portugal. With this objective, we plan to implement a large-scale online experiment conducted to a representative sample of the Portuguese population.
We start by eliciting quantitative beliefs about the evolution of statistic indicators between 2015 and 2022. Then, for half of the sample, randomly drawn, we provide them the comparison between their perceptions and the official numbers provided by Statistics Portugal and the Eurostat.
Our main research question is to study how presenting quantitative reliable information about the severity of the housing crisis and key related events affects public policy preferences. We note that, for all these policy actions, we provide simple trade-off situations so that respondents can easily consider both the benefits and the costs of their choices.
