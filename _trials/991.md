abstract: "This document describes analyses we plan to conduct on the data from a randomized controlled trial in southwestern Kenya conducted in 2015â€“2016. In this trial, we test if either or both of two social psychological interventions can affect psychological and economic outcomes over a two-month period and if the effects of interventions differ if they are delivered individually or in randomly assigned groups.
