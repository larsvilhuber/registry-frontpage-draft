abstract: "This document describes the analysis plan for a pilot studying whether informing husbands about spousal income affects the women's behavior in a willingness to pay elicitation game. The game elicit the willingness to pay for receiving a transfer instead of having the spouse receiving it and was proposed by  Alm\aa s, Armand, Attanasio and Carneiro (2015). For the treatment group, information about earnings from the experiment is revealed to the spouse, whereas for the control group, no information is revealed. The aim is to study if there is any sign of hiding or whether targeted transfers seems to go into the collective household pot. These results will inform us whether the collective model set-up is reasonable or models that assume hiding of money is more appropriate. We also conduct in-depth interviews with the participants after the experiment in order to further search for an understanding of the environment and mechanisms at play.
