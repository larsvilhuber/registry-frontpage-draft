abstract: "Studies of the effects and effectiveness of reminders in economics have documented that reminders can influence behavior in desired ways across a wide variety of settings. However, using a large scale field experiment with a charitable organisation, we document that this may come at a cost because reminders may push some recipients to unsubscribe. We set up a model explaining this finding and test the model's implications using another large scale field experiment."
