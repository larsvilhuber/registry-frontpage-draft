abstract: "We study the role of credit constraints in determining householdsâ€™ willingness to pay for a remedial education program for girls in Tanzania. The program offers tutoring in Math and English, as well as peer-mentoring in life skills to girls via community clubs. Prior to revealing the price of the program, potential participants entered a public lottery for a cash transfer, followed by an incentive-compatible willingness to pay elicitation. "
