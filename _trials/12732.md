abstract: "We test the effectiveness of AI augmentation in crowdfunding campaign preparation. We use a randomized control trial design in which participants are randomly assigned to review various pairs of crowdfunding campaigns.  These campaign info pages differ in their degree of AI augmentation. Analyzing the participants' preferences, we examine whether the crowdfunding campaign augmented by AI positively influences their propensity to contribute financially."
