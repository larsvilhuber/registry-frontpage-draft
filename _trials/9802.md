abstract: "Rejection is psychologically costly. Certain activities, such as searching for a job, come with the potential for experiencing repeated rejection. These experiences may impose a psychological cost high enough to create disincentives to job search, contributing to sub-optimal search effort. In the real world, it is difficult to isolate the role of rejection in determining job search from the roles played by other beliefs about the risks and rewards associated with job search and with the outside options to search. To get around this, I implement a laboratory experiment with a theoretically relevant population (young South African workers and work-seekers) in which I control the risks and pecuniary rewards to a high-rejection activity (search) relative to a low-rejection activity (focusing on a temporary job-in-hand). By varying relevant parameters across treatment conditions in the experiment, I hope to be able to estimate the elasticity of job search to rejection, appropriately bench-marked against the elasticity of job search to pecuniary incentives to search. Other treatment conditions will allow me to investigate the role played by feedback and peer information in exacerbating/mitigating the effect of rejection on job search. "
