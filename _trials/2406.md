abstract: "In the replication study of Camerer et al. (2016), Chen and Chen (2011) did not replicate. In this study, we seek to understand reasons which might have led to the non-replication. One protocol deviation in the replication was that the replication author did not read the instructions for the coordination game aloud, thus removing the common knowledge condition from the minimum effort coordination game. We conjecture that common knowledge is critical to establish efficient coordination with ingroup members. In a series of laboratory experiments, we vary the experimental condition by conducting two treatments with and two without common knowledge."
