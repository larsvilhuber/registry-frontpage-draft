abstract: "Uganda is one of the 35/194 WHO Member States which have not succeeded in reaching the Global Vaccine Action Planâ€™s (GVAP) intermediate goal of reaching 90% national coverage with three doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis containing vaccines by 2015 (WHO, 2015). In the search for novel ways to address low and stagnating vaccination rates and improve access to and utilisation of immunisation services increased attention is being paid to the role of communities, and community engagement (CE) strategies (Sabarwal et al., 2015). Contextual factors and the degree to which community members understand and trust the immunisation process affect vaccination coverage rates (Rainey et al., 2011, Favin et al., 2012, Streefland et al., 1999). The effectiveness of CE strategies in addressing vaccine supply and demand factors and improving vaccine coverage is less well known. Evidence suggests that vaccine interventions that are designed and co-managed with community members are more likely to be successful, however more attention needs to be paid to evaluating and developing current CE practice (Sabarwal et al., 2015).  

The 'Fifth Child' project, implemented by the International Rescue Committee (IRC), is a community engagement strategy which utilizes an immunisation status data management and tracking system with two objectives: 1) To improve access to quality data on immunization status through a user-friendly data platform; and 2) to utilise community engagement to trace defaulters and optimize outreaches through collaboration between Community Health Workers, village leaders and health centre staff.  

The evaluation of this intervention is led by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) Uganda and aims to contribute to the emerging evidence base through a cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) with an embedded process evaluation and cost effectiveness analysis (undertaken by the IRC). Data collection will consist of household and health centre surveys during a baseline and endline, as well as a qualitative process evaluation component.
