abstract: "The proposed evaluation will examine the impact of a psychology-based entrepreneurship training, attended with and without a spouse, and in-kind grants on women-owned micro and small enterprises in the DRC. Treatment arms will include (i) Personal Initiative training for women and (ii) Personal Initiative training for women and their husbands , each cross-randomized with grants. These interventions are designed to relax multiple constraints faced by women entrepreneurs including capital, skills, and household level inefficiencies influenced by gender norms.

The study aims to answer the following questions: 
•	Does a psychology-based business training focused on the entrepreneurial mindset increase the profits of women entrepreneurs in the DRC? 
•	Does inviting the entrepreneur’s husband to the psychology-based training improve outcomes of the training for women’s businesses and household-level economic outcomes? 
•	Does complementing training with a grant help compound the impacts of the training? 
•	Does complementing a grant with a psychology-based business training help compound the impacts of the grant? 

The main outcomes of interest include firm performance, intra-household dynamics, and women’s empowerment. The interventions evaluated are components of the DRC SME Development and Growth Project which is implemented by the Government of the DRC, with support from the World Bank.
