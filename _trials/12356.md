abstract: "The objective of this research is to test the effectiveness various interventions to increase cooperation and trust among Malagasy by exposing participants to a series of framings or questions that promote cooperative behavior. Our work aims to develop a chatbot-based game to achieve this objective of boosting cooperation and feelings of trust. In addition, we aim to understand the factors that drive competitive and corrupt behavior. The success of the intervention will be measured by comparing the performance in an economic trust game between the different interventions."
