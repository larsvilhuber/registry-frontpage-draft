abstract: "Temptations are an ever-present aspect of human life, influencing our decisions and actions in both subtle and overt ways. In this experiment, we aimed to explore how individuals respond to these temptations by engaging in real-effort tasks, which serve as a practical means to reflect on past behaviors. Specifically, we sought to understand the learning process by analyzing how participants adjusted their future actions based on their previous experiences. To achieve this, we compared the actual work completed by participants at different time intervals with their pre-determined work schedules. This comparison allowed us to evaluate the extent to which participants internalized lessons from their past efforts, providing insight into their ability to modify behavior in response to earlier outcomes. By examining these patterns, our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying self-regulation and behavioral adaptation in the face of recurring temptations."
