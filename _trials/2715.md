abstract: "Does cognitive load increase reliance on who we trust when making decisions?  We design a lab in the field experiment to explore factors affecting takeup of a novel agricultural index insurance product.  We randomly prime subjects to experience cognitive load, a state of limited limited mental resources, and also randomly provide endorsement of the product by a trusted individual.  A short experimental game is carried out to measure subjects' risk aversion.  "
