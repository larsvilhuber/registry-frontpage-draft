abstract: "This study is a randomized controlled trial testing a cash transfer and mentorship program for vulnerable Ugandan and refugee microentrepreneurs. The study has multiple treatment arms and a control arm, which will be offered the treatment after conclusion of the study. All treatment arms will receive a cash grant after six weeks and be eligible for an additional lottery every two months, which provides a cash reward for having an open business at the time of the lottery draw. In addition to the cash grant and lottery, some clients will be assigned to a mentorship group, consisting of 3 total microenterprise clients and a mentor. For some groups, the payouts in the lottery will depend on their individual business performance, and for other groups, the payouts will depend on their group members’ business performance. By giving group members a stake in the others’ success, a pay-for-performance structure could encourage the group to invest additional effort in each other and / or disclose valuable information or techniques. Finally, some groups will mix nationalities (2 Ugandans and 2 refugees of the same nationality) and / or mix genders (2 men and 2 women) to evaluate the value of heterogeneous groups compared to homogeneous groups on these dimensions."
