abstract: "We study women’s willingness-to-pay for various partner attributes through a large-scale survey experiment with a representative sample of women aged 18-55 in urban areas of Chile. Our main focus is on violent attributes. We ask women to rate several hypothetical male profiles by their desirability as partners. Using the ratings women give to hypothetical profiles, we estimate women’s willingness-to-pay for various partner attributes."
