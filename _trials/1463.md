The Population Council is evaluating interventions in 4 countries: India, Malawi, Mali and Niger.  In India and Malawi, we are using a cluster randomized design to assign locations as either intervention or comparison.  In Mali and Niger, due to the design of the intervention, we are matching intervention and comparison areas to assess program impact.  In each of the four countries we are conducting baseline, midline and endline surveys with females 12-19 (approximately 5,000 in total; sample sizes vary by country) as well as qualitative data collection to 1) assess program impact; 2) better understand the context in which early marriage occurs, and the process of early marriage; and 3) examine other factors that may influence early marriage in particular settings (e.g., migration in West Africa).
