abstract: "In developing countries where formal institutions are often weak, peer monitoring represents a natural mechanism for the enforcement of agreements. This paper studies the demand for monitoring and its effectiveness in sustaining cooperation across social groups.
Mapping the social networks of 19 Nepali villages, we conduct an experiment to explore the role of the endogenous choice of monitors on cooperation. The paper shows that closely knit groups are 40% points less likely to choose a central monitor, while sparse groups tend to prefer a monitor who is highly central in the network.  The democratic selection of monitoring improves cooperation by up to 22% compared to an exogenous assignment, but only in sparse groups. Further, we observe that in sparse groups the positive effect of endogenous monitoring can spill-over to games played under exogenous assignment."
