abstract: "This project aims at piloting a cash for subsidy reform, replacing fossil fuel subsidies with cash payments. We plan to pilot the intervention in Ghana, within the context of the Premix Fuel Program – a very large “conditional” and digitized program subsidizing a large portion of fuel use among fishermen along the country’s coastal communities. The research design aims to randomize a fraction of beneficiaries across localities that currently receive conditional digital transfers for Premix fuel to receive equivalent “unconditional” digital transfers in a way that allows for clean measurement of relevant outcomes, including public support and aggregate and general equilibrium impacts. The focus will be on three treated landing beaches where 100% of program beneficiaries will be treated for about three months. We plan to survey the treated communities with pre and post surveys as well as more than ten untreated communities to build the control group and to compare response and attrition rates."
