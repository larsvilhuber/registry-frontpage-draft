abstract: "This study will examine how the progressivity of taxes and government transfers impacts people’s willingness to pay tax through a large-scale randomized survey experiment across eight developing countries (Colombia, Ghana, Indonesia, Jordan, Mexico, Sri Lanka, South Africa and Tanzania). Respondents will be randomly allocated to either receive information about the progressivity of taxes and/or government transfers in their country or to receive no information. The treatments are based on a recently released, cross-country database that measures the Sustainable Development Goal target to improve the redistributive impact of fiscal policy. The impact of these treatments on people’s willingness to pay tax will be measured using standardized questions from the existing literature. By examining heterogenous treatment effects based on people’s prior beliefs and preferences as well as differences across countries it will be possible to identify how equity and reciprocity considerations influence people’s willingness to pay tax."
