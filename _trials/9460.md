abstract: "This study investigates the compliance behavior of small businesses in Indonesia by utilizing a large-scale natural field experiment conducted in collaboration with the Indonesian tax authority – Directorate General of Taxation (DGT). We analyze the tax compliance effects of three treatment letters focusing on deterrence, literacy and public goods provision messaging. We find that all treatments significantly increase tax filing and payment. Our results indicate that the deterrence letter has the most significant effect on payment. In contrast, the literacy letter triggers the largest increase in filing rates and timely filing but the lowest increase in payment. Our analysis of heterogeneous treatment effects reveals considerable variation in treatment effects across regions, sectors, and annual turnover.

Our study evaluates the effectiveness of deterrence, literacy, and public goods provision messages on tax filing and tax payment as the proxy of tax compliance. We utilize the data from a natural field experiment that has been implemented in collaboration with the Directorate General of Taxation (DGT). The field experiment is conducted on 18 local tax offices under three Regional Tax Offices (RTO), including North Jakarta RTO, South Sumatera and Bangka Belitung RTO, and Nusa Tenggara RTO. The target population consists of approximately 12,000 small businesses – those with annual turnover less than IDR4.8 billion. The target population covers individuals and small firms categorized as zero-filers and late-filers in at least three months during the previous fiscal year."
