abstract: "We investigate the behavioral impact of reminders to encourage energy savings of consumers in Japan. Our reminders will be sent just before the peak-demand hours, as the marginal cost of electricity is substantially higher at these hours than during the rest of the hours in a month. We use mobile phone app and SMS to send the reminders. In front of the reminders, messages to encourage demand shift (moral suasion) are also sent to both control and treatment groups. "
