abstract: "Rural women worldwide face multiple barriers to quality maternal healthcare, leading to high maternal and infant mortality rates. Demand-side constraints are numerous, but it is believed that fixed costs associated to remoteness -i.e. transportation and accommodation costs- are key. Yet, it is not well understood in the Economics literature the effectiveness of lifting these interlinked constraints. We conducted a randomized controlled experiment to test whether vouchers for transportation to access quality antenatal care and vouchers for transportation and accommodation for institutional delivery and post-natal checks were effective in boosting quality antenatal, post-natal care and institutional delivery among poor, pregnant women, living in remote communities of Nicaragua (at least 4 hours away from skilled health centres and birth centres). All health services were free at the points of use. We randomly allocated 76 community clusters to the treatment and 76 to the control. The intervention was implemented between June 2013 and December 2018. We conducted a census and survey of pregnant women in the 152 community clusters by the end of 2018, and we additionally rely on administrative data. The main research questions are: RQ1 "To what extent releasing transportation and accommodation constraints increase take-up of ante-natal care?" RQ2 "To what extent releasing these constraints increase institutional delivery?" RQ3 "To what extent releasing these constraints improves take-up of post-natal checks for mothers and newborns?"."
