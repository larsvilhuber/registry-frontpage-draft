abstract: "Refugeesâ€™ sense of social integration will be low if discrimination and/or perceived discrimination is widespread. In this study we use unique Norwegian survey data combined with administrative data to examine determinants of perceptions as well as determinants of integration. We will further estimate the causal relationship between perceptions of discrimination and sense of inclusion. In the study, which targets the full population of UN refugees in Norway, we map personal experiences with discrimination and experimentally provide information treatments on the extent of discrimination against minorities, and study how these variables shape sense of belonging and exclusion. This pre-plan describes how we will analyze the data from the information treatments."
