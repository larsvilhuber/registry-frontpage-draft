abstract: "This study investigates the effects of targeted information about public service provision on citizen beliefs about the government, taxation, and their intention to participate politically in Freetown, Sierra Leone. Publicly available data on services provided by the Freetown City Council (FCC) is used to inform citizens about public services in their area. Treated individuals receive both an information call and a short message including information on the type and location of the provided service. To test the importance of individual service preferences, the content of the information calls is randomly varied to match or mismatch individual service preferences elicited at baseline. "
