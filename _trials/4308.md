abstract: "The process of development is uneven, often leaving behind political minorities and marginalized groups. In this paper, we present new evidence of historically marginalized groups using the relatively nascent technology of grievance redressal mechanisms to exercise voice, negotiate conflict and, crucially, attempt to make development more equitable. Our reduced form causal results establish the following: lower-tiered marginalized representatives - who are also members of the state - use grievance redressal mechanisms to lobby upper tiers of the state for improved public good provision. We then show that marginalized representatives are particularly likely to file grievances when there is some pre-existing conflict between them and their upper-tier counterparts. Potential for conflict also worsens public good provision. The objective of this experiment is to understand how, if at all, grievance filing by incumbent lower-tiered representatives from marginalized groups affects provision of water-and-sanitation (WAS) public goods in their jurisdictions. We also intend to measure spillover effects of grievance filing by representatives. "
