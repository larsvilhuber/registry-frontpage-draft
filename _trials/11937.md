abstract: "Farmer experimentation with new technologies is constant and fundamental to adoption, innovation, and climate adaptation. Even so, this experimentation often takes place in semi-private ways that limit the positive externalities of their effort and slows learning by others. We implement a village-level randomized controlled trial to evaluate three strategies to promote farmer experimentation and learning. We vary the proportion of farmers in a village to whom we offer maize seed trial packs, splitting the low concentration treatment arm to an incentive and non-incentive group. In 52 villages, 10% of villagers receiving trial packs of 0.5 kgs of maize. In 52 villages, 10% of the farmers receive packs plus incentives to compensate them for the knowledge that they generate. In a third arm of 52 villages 35% of the farmers receive trial packs. All participant farmers receive a sign to post next to their experimental field to mark their work. We study the relative effects of these treatment arms on effort by disseminating farmer, further experimentation by individual farmers, learning, perceptions and yield expectation, and adoption of new maize varieties. We use our design to test the effects of different levels of saturation within a village against a model where farmers are compensated for their experimental efforts."
