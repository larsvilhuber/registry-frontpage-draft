abstract: "Choosing the best-fit major is a substantial challenge for many students, especially those in education systems with less flexibility in major-switching. This experiment studies how high school students evaluate various characteristics of college majors, and the impact on their academic preparation for college and other socioemotional outcomes. I conduct experiments on grade 10 students (i.e., first-year high school students) in China. First, I examine high school students' expectations for intended college majors. Using an online survey, I ask whether they have intended majors, the primary reasons they consider those majors, their personal tastes for those majors, and their (un)certainty and knowledge about the wage and non-wage aspects of the majors. Second, I use an experiment to provide students with tutorials on their top three majors. Each tutorial covers course requirements, relevant high school subjects, career options, and mini-lectures about key concepts and applications of a college major. I study how students update their expectations for their intended college majors and change their behavior in academic preparation, goal-setting, and the choice of major. The results of the experiment will help us better understand how high school students make college major choices.
