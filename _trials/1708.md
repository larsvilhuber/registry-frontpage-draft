abstract: "The internal armed conflict in Colombia has lasted over 52 years and left over 8 million victims.  In 2011, the Government signed a progressive and comprehensive Victims and Land Restitution Law (Law 1448) that ensures the right of access to truth, justice, reparation, and no repetition to all victims. This impact evaluation estimates the effects of a national government program that serves as a front door for victims to access justice services - the Mobile Victims Unit - which brings together three public entities with different responsibilities within the provision of services to victims. Moving around the country visiting marginalized communities, the unit’s staff provide a range of services including the provision of information on victims’ rights, legal aid to enable victims to file declarations of victimhood and appeals with the State, and the provision of updated and personalized information about where victims’ cases stand in the bureaucratic process of enrollment and implementation of a variety of public reparation, assistance, and attention services.  This trial estimates the short-term effects of access to these services on two levels: the individual victim level and also at the community level, by surveying program participants and a random sample of community members.  The effects will be estimated on reception of reparations, knowledge of rights, access to justice, integration into the community (economic and social), and perceptions of justice and the State. "
