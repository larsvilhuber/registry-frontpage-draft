abstract: "Artificial intelligence (AI) is ubiquitous and affects human behavior in many ways. Some studies have examined the benefits of AI in increasing the accuracy of human decision making, as well as people’s attitudes toward AI. However, experimental evidence on the effect of AI on individual preference is limited. This project investigates people’s risk-taking behavior under AI-based recommendations. In our experiment, subjects make binary choices between two lotteries that differ in consequences and probabilities. We construct a set of choice problems to systematically examine risk-taking behavior, in terms of satisfaction of decision axioms, exhibition of typical paradoxes, fitness of models on decision theory, and so on. The experiment consists of three stages. In Stage 1, subjects make decisions without recommendation. In Stage 2, subjects are randomly divided into five groups. Two baseline groups provide no recommendation or random recommendation. Three treatment groups provide recommendations based on user-based collaborative filtering, random forest, or the popularity of options, which are representative methods used in the field. Subjects make their own decisions after they receive the recommendation if any. After Stage 2, subjects in groups with recommendations are asked to pay to receive/avoid the recommendation for the next stage, whereby they have another 60 choice problems. This experiment allows us to compare risk-taking behavior and attitudes toward AI among groups. "
