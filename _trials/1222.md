abstract: "Abstract
Background: Patent dactus arteriosus (PDA) needs treatment for cases whose ducts are not closed spontaneously. Furosemide reduces preload, but there is still controversy regarding the protocol of its administration between pediatricians and pediatric cardiologists. We aimed to compare renal complications and electrolyte imbalance of three protocols of administering furosemide.
Methods: In this prospective study, 127 preterm neonates with PDA were randomly assigned into three different groups: 2 mg/kg very slow infusion Furosemide was given intravenously to 47 neonates slow infusion every other day (group A), 1 mg/kg very slow infusion to 39 neonates every day (group B), and 0.5 mg/kg per dose bolus doses twice a day to 41 neonates (group C) for about 14 days. Then, all participants underwent kidney ultrasonography. Blood and urine samples were taken from them on day 3 and 17. Data were analyzed by SPSS software. 
Results: Electrolyte imbalance included higher sodium and calcium on the third day in group A (P<0.05) with no difference in serum level of potassium, PH, and HCO3. The serum level of calcium and Ca/Cr ratio was higher in group A (P<0.05) and serum level of BUN was higher in group B (P<0.05). Also, higher serum level of calcium and Ca/Cr ratio was observed on the seventeenth day in group A. Nephrocalcinosis was observed in 8.7% of neonates on the seventeenth day after furosemide with normal level of creatinine (P=0.896).
Conclusion: Administering furosemide in two bolus doses is superior regarding electrolyte imbalance and BUN levels, but nephrocalcinosis was not found to be different in three protocols.
