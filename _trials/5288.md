abstract: "School choice may allow schools to “cream skim,” or impede access, to students perceived as easier to educate or challenging to educate. To test this, we conducted two field experiments, where we sent emails from fictitious parents to charter schools and traditional public schools subject to school choice in 29 states and Washington, D.C. The fictitious parent asked whether any student is eligible to apply to the school and how to apply. Each email signaled a randomly assigned attribute of the child. These randomly assigned attributes signaled the child had one of four conditions about their behavior:  a significant special need, poor behavior, high or low prior achievement, and no indication of a condition. Furthermore, fictitious parents and children were randomly assigned attributes, including ethnic-sounding names, gendered-sounding names, whether the child is raised in a two-parent versus one-parent household, and whether the child is a son or daughter. E-mail responses are monitored to detect any systematic evidence of discriminatory practices."
