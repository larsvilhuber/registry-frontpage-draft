abstract: "With large-scale efforts for COVID-19 vaccine development underway, there is a spotlight on participation in medical research studies in general, and efforts to improve inclusivity and diversity in particular. Research programs often adopt information-based approaches to increase interest in research participation. It is difficult to determine the efficacy of such approaches because of confounds with information comprehension as well as a possible disconnect between information provision and specific concerns that a target population might have. In addition, certain demographic subgroups may have stronger or different barriers to research engagement, which can impact the efficacy of targeted and comprehensive information provision. For example, previous research has found that many marginalized communities are distrustful of research and research organizations, possibly as a result of having endured historical atrocities in the name of research. We evaluate the effectiveness of information provision in a large online experiment where individuals are randomly assigned to different recruitment materials for a genetic research program and give participants the opportunity to sign up to take part. We experimentally test the impact of recruitment materials emphasizing the trustworthiness of genomic research and the organization or perceived benefits of participating for the individual and their community, which previous work suggests are two key barriers to research participation, particularly for ethnic minorities. This is compared against baseline recruitment materials that give only general information about the program. The findings from this study will inform whether different types of information provision are effective for recruitment into a genomic research program, particularly among a socio-demographically diverse population."
