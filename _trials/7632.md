abstract: "Many public organizations use Pay-for-Performance (PfP) schemes as a means for promoting the performance of the public services. Does the widespread use of PfP in the public sector have unintended consequences in terms of job attraction? Does PfP affect the prospects of representative bureaucracies? Using a within-subjects conjoint survey experimental design among a non-probability sample of US residents (n = 1,500), this study examines whether PfP (vs. fixed pay) make individuals of particular race, gender, and age—e.g., people of color, women, and older people—less attracted to a public sector job."
