abstract: "We study the relationship between self-control and performance while working from home. In an online experiment, we randomly assign participants to one of three different self-control strategy treatments. These treatments are expected to increase participants’ self-reported productivity, goal achievement and job satisfaction. We will compute average treatment effects of the respective self-control strategies as well as analyze success of the strategies conditional on subjects’ individual characteristics. This evaluation will reveal whether some self-control strategies are more effective than others for individuals with different attributes, for example different personality traits and socio-demographic characteristics. Subjects will also answer questions about their natural use of self-control strategies apart from their treatment strategy. With pre-intervention data, we conduct a correlational analysis examining the determinants of performance and satisfaction working from home."
