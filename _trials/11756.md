abstract: "Burnout is one of the most important occupational threats today, especially since the increase in job stressors due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Burnout imposes costs for the individual, firms, and society in terms of productivity losses and well-being. Yet, there is little evidence of its causal effects on productivity measures. We will exploit a natural field experiment in the call center of a debt collection agency in Ecuador. To evaluate the effects of burnout on workers' productivity, we will use an instrumental variables design. We exploit random assignment to nudge participation in a six-week intervention that consists in sharing positive professional experiences while reading their peersÂ´ stories through an online platform as an instrument to explore if reciprocal sharing with co-workers could reduce burnout and the effect of these changes in burnout on workers' productivity. Based on empirical evidence and theory, we expect that decreasing burnout leads to meaningful productivity gains."
