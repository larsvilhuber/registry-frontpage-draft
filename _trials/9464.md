abstract: "We study the effect of providing personalized information about the substitutability potential of people’s jobs on their labor market expectations and their likelihood to participate in professional development or retraining. For that purpose, we implement an experiment among a representative survey of adults in Germany (18 years and older) where we provide treatment group members with factual information about the substitutability potential of their own job. By comparing responses between the uninformed control group and the informed treatment group, we evaluate whether this information affects (i) people’s labor market expectations about their own professional future and about the future of their jobs, and (ii) peoples’ likelihood to participate in professional development and retraining as well as their willingness to forgo part of their wage during professional development."
