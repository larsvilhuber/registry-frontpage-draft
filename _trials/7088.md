abstract: "Antenatal care (ANC) is critical for the mother and childâ€™s health. WHO recommends 8 ANC contacts and Indian policy recommends at least 4 ANC contacts, with both pushing for the first contact to be within the first trimester. These requirements are not met in many districts in India due to a variety of reasons. Here, as a Phase I experiment, we plan to remotely test different types of framing of message interventions in order to improve attendance of 4 ANC contacts in two districts in Uttar Pradesh by measuring intentionality to avail ANC contacts and the value perception of ANC services."
