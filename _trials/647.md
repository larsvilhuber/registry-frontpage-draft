abstract: "This paper describes the analysis plan for a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of micro-insurance provision to informal workers in Nairobi, Kenya. In 2011, we worked with the Co-operative Insurance Company (CIC) to provide free health insurance to 300 randomly selected metal workers in Kamukunji Jua Kali. The policy included inpatient and outpatient coverage that applied to the participantâ€™s house- hold. Another randomly selected sample of 300 Jua Kali workers received a one-time unconditional cash transfer equal in value to the insurance policy. This study aims to identify the impact of health micro-insurance vis-`a-vis cash transfers on the economic and psychological well-being of treated individuals. This plan outlines our evaluation questions, outcomes of interest, and a proposed econometric approach."
