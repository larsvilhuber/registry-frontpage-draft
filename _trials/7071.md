abstract: "Governments and non-profits devote substantial resources to increasing take-up of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) through educational outreach. We study a different approach -- policies that encourage tax filing -- to determine whether such policies can be an effective way to increase take-up of tax-administered social benefits. Specifically, we study the effect of IRS letters about free tax preparation on filing and EITC take-up using a large field experiment."
