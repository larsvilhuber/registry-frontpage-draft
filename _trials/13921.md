abstract: "This proposal addresses the challenges of educational heterogeneity and the need for personalized instruction in India. This project provides personalized learning and high quality state aligned content in vernacular language to students through Computer Assisted Learning (CAL) by leveraging Khan Academy, a widely recognized online educational platform to address the foundational gaps and low academic levels among students in government schools in India.

The core strategy involves deploying 'khoaches' to selected government schools in Uttar Pradesh, who will facilitate the integration of Khan Academy into the curriculum, offer training to teachers and students, and ensure effective use of the platform. This intervention aims to improve math scores by allowing students to learn at their own pace, receive immediate feedback, and engage in mastery-based learning. The project will employ a randomized controlled trial to evaluate its impact, focusing on grades 6 to 8 mathematics, with an aim to provide credible evidence on the benefits of CAL when supported by trained personnel. The research will also examine how well teachers adopt the guided approach a year later, after completing their training.
