abstract: "All pupils in Danish public schools undergo evaluations of their readiness to embark on post-compulsory school education during grade 8 and grade 9.
 
One in three pupils are evaluated by teachers to be at risk of lacking the academic, social or personal skills to be ready for post-compulsory school education. 

On behalf of the Danish Ministry of Education, the trial tests whether a 2-week intensive learning camp in grade 8 has positive effects on academic outcomes (such test scores, absenteeism), non-cognitive skills, wellbeing, and readiness for post-compulsory school education. Long run outcomes (such as wages and employment) might be examined at a later point.

The intensive learning camp is targeted at pupils at risk of not being ready for post-compulsory school education and is implemented at schools, by the schoolâ€™s own teachers and pedagogues, as a remedial education program.
