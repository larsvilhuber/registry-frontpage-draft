abstract: "This project examines individuals' preferences for receiving feedback on their performance on a mock job interview. We will explore how preferences for feedback depend on beliefs of relative performance, possibility of gender discrimination by the provider of the feedback, and gender. We will also elicit unincentivized data on how individuals interpret and generalize both positive and negative feedback. "
