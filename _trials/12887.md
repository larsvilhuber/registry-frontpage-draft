abstract: "we collaborate with a transportation company that provides on-demand car rides and self-insures against traffic accidents its drivers incur. Using drivers’ smartphone sensor data, we can accurately identify handheld phone use (“HPU”) behavior. We sent a simple text message to a random subset of drivers with high HPU. The message called attention to their HPU behavior and reminded them that repeated passenger complaints of unsafe driving could lead to suspension. "
