abstract: "Good employee health and wellbeing is of key importance to employers and the economy.  For example in the workplace, 6.5m employees reported musculoskeletal problems in 2008 and this is predicted to rise to 7m employees by 2030. Similarly the impact of mental ill health in the West Midlands is significant; overall mental ill health costs the West Midlands an estimated £12.5bn annually, equivalent to £3,100 per population head, per year. As a setting for health promotion, workplaces enable access to large groups of people to promote health and wellbeing. The increase in the last decade of schemes aimed at changing the health related behaviour of the public has been accompanied by evidence that even small incentives can positively influence choices. The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of a cluster randomised controlled trial offering wellbeing monetary incentives to small-medium enterprises in the West Midlands. This is to establish whether small-medium enterprises will improve their health and wellbeing offer and achieve higher employee awareness and participation in the offer in response to a monetary wellbeing incentive.
