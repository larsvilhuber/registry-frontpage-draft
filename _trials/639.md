abstract: "The National Study of CMO Effectiveness is a longitudinal research effort designed to measure how nonprofit charter school management organizations (CMOs) affect student achievement and to examine the internal structures, practices, and policy contexts that may influence these outcomes. The study examines CMO impacts on student achievement in middle school, high school graduation, and postsecondary enrolment using quasi-experimental methods for a large sample of schools. In a smaller sample of oversubscribed schools, we obtain experimental CMO impacts in elementary, middle and high schools using lottery data."
