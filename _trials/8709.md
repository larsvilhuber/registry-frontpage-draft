abstract: "In several of the path-breaking works of Kahneman and Tversky from the mid-70s to mid-80s, they found evidence of the importance of framing in situations where decisions are made in the presence of risk. They hypothesised that imaginability (visual imagery) may play an important role in the evaluation of risk. Still, to date, the impact of visual imagery skills on risky choices, and how this may interact with decision frames, has not been investigated. This is precisely what we will investigate in this project. "
