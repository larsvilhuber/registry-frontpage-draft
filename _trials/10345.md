abstract: "We aim to investigate how individual-specific tailored advice about expected consumer surplus from index-based livestock insurance (IBLI), combined with incentives for insurance agents aligned with the tailored advice, impact take-up and consumer welfare from IBLI. To do so, we conduct a cluster-randomized controlled trial with 2400 pastoralists in 240 zones in Borena, Ethiopia. Zones were randomly assigned to three treatment arms. In the first arm pastoralists received status quo insurance promotion activities from the insurance company via insurance agents and insurance agents received a status quo sales incentive for their activities. In the second arm pastoralists received tailored financial advice based on elicited risk preferences, actual herd size, and subjective beliefs about herd losses and weather conditions and insurance agents received status quo sales incentives. In the third arm pastoralists received tailored financial advice, and insurance agents received incentives linked to the expected welfare generated by pastoralist's decisions. The interventions were delivered by Oromia Insurance Company (OIC) in collaboration with the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), the Ethiopian Environment and Climate Research Centre (ECRC) at the Policy Studies Institute (PSI), Cornell University, Center for the Economic Analysis of Risk (CEAR) at Georgia State University, and Utrecht University.
