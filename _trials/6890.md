abstract: "As in most of Sub-Saharan Africa, the lack of quality employment among the rural youth is threatening economic development and inclusive growth, with employment search arguably working as an important driver for both internal and international migration. Active labour market policies, such as vocational trainings, are frequently chosen by governments, international institutions and NGOs as a potential solution to these labour market frictions. Nevertheless, the causal evidence determining the impact of these programs on the youth of rural areas is scarce in the sub-region, and inexistent in Guinea-Bissau. In this project, we run a randomized controlled trial within the GOT project implemented by the NGO ENGIM. This project provides vocational training courses on professional skills thought to be particularly relevant in the local context, and facilitates traineeships in local businesses for young men in two northern regions of the country, aiming to prevent their engagement in irregular migration practices. Assessing the impact of the GOT project on the employment rates, income and attitudes towards migrations of its trainees should contribute to a better understanding of the impact of active labour market policies in rural areas of low income countries, facilitating a better design, implementation and evaluation of such programmes in Guinea-Bissau and similar contexts.
