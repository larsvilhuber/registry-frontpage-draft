abstract: "In a lab-in-the-field experiment I investigate to what extent spouses’ relative influence in household decision-making differ across decision domain. The sample consists of couples in rural Vietnam. In the experiment, spouses make individual and joint decisions with respect to an investment decision and a voluntary contribution decision to a local social fund for poor households in the village. I collect a rich set of household and individual characteristics as well as measures of beliefs and knowledge. I use the survey data collected to explore what background characteristic that determine spouses relative influence and to what extent these factors differ across decision domains. Of specific interest are measures of spouses’ responsibility for the household’s social relations constructed by a set of self-reported survey answers.  


Additional results from the study will include an analysis of the association between self-reported measures of relative influence in household decision-making and my experimental measures collected in the experiment. "
