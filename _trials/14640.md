abstract: "The rapid development of AI technologies in recent years is reshaping the labor market. This study investigates how AI skills affect employment outcomes and whether they interact with gender. A large-scale resume field experiment will be conducted in China, sending thousands of fictitious resumes to potential employers. The resumes will vary randomly in terms of applicants’ AI skills and gender. We also explore the potential heterogeneity in outcomes based on applicant characteristics and job attributes."
