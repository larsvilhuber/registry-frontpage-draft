abstract: "Minorities are underrepresented in enterprise ownership and leadership positions in big firms. Why? This paper empirically investigates the role of one potential reason for this: discrimination against minority employers by subordinate workers. I embed a field experiment in the recruitment of entry-level workers by a firm based in India. The field experiment aims to answer two main research questions: 1) Do minority employers face discrimination from below in labor markets? 2) What are the underlying motivations? I specifically test for two potential motives: attention discrimination and social image concerns."
