abstract: "In this study, we develop and extent the real-effort experimental design proposed by Abeler et al. (2011) to test reference-dependent preferences under dynamically changing expectations. To that end, we manipulate expectations via positive earnings shocks and analyze how this affects effort provision. We further shed light heterogeneity among participants with a focus on gender-specific differences and gamification factors influencing the perception of work effort.
Our study helps to reconcile contradicting empirical evidence from the field, specifically in the cab driver market (Camerer et al. (1997), Crawford and Meng (2011) and Farber (2005, 2008, 2015)).
