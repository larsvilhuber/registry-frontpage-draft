abstract: "Poor sanitation is an important cause of childhood diarrhea, which often leads to child mortality. We will study how to increase demand and decrease prices for an improved sanitation technology, mechanical desludging. On the demand side, we will measure the effects of social and behavioral factors (social pressure, learning, and procrastination) on household demand. In a related trial focused on the supply side, we will study the effect of different auction mechanisms on collusion and prices paid by consumers."
