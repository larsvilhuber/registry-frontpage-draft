abstract: "Incarceration results in the disruption of relationships for those in prison, affecting family, work, and community ties. Reestablishing those connections after being released is a complex process. In many cases, recently liberated individuals won't have access to the support system required to reinsert themselves in society after their liberation, resulting in prison recidivism in the short term.
The newly published recidivism statistics for the 2019 Uruguayan liberated cohort suggest that the problem might be more dire. Three of every ten liberated individuals will be re-incarcerated within the first six months after their liberation, 44.1% within the first year, and 65.6% will be reincarcerated within three years.  

This project will assess the effectiveness of "Proyecto de Inclusión Asistida" (PIA, assisted inclusion program), a program jointly run by the Ministry of Social Development (MIDES) and the Ministry of Interior (MI) from Uruguay. 

 The program aims to reduce the recidivism rate among male released inmates who serve a sentence of least two months by providing monthly conditional cash transfers for six months, access to transportation passes (local or inter-state), information about other government programs they may be eligible for, and periodic personalized mentoring from social workers after their liberation.
After an initial evaluation before being released, a specific social worker is assigned to each case, and follow-ups are scheduled outside the prison within the first month, second, and fourth month after being liberated. These visits aim to allow individuals to continue developing their life plans after prison and are a requirement for continuing to receive the program's benefits.  

The primary goal of the program is to reduce the rates of recidivism and involvement in criminal activities, as well as to increase employment rates and the take up of social services after liberation for a more at-risk population. The results of this project will contribute to a better understanding of the short and medium-term impact of conditional cash transfer programs and mentoring for released individuals."
