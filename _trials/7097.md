abstract: "We investigate the demand of AI skills in real job applications with a correspondence experiment. We send fictitious job applications in response to real job postings for entry-level employees with a business administration background on UK-based online job boards, randomly varying whether the CVs include AI skills. First, we study the effect of these skills on the callback rate. Second, we investigate potential differences across three types of business administration jobs (marketing, HR and finance and accounting)."
