abstract: "We investigate the suspected detrimental effect of markets on morals by shedding light on corrupt behavior among individuals of two generations who experienced differing institutional environments. These varying experiences imply a disparate exposure to market conditions, shaping individuals' preferences and beliefs during socialization. We aim to understand whether these experiences affect the inclination toward immoral, here especially corrupt, behavior. Additionally, we explore how adapting institutions to a market-oriented system influences this inclination toward corrupt behavior among different generations. Considering Germany's reunification as a natural experiment for fundamental institutional change in the Eastern part of Germany, we conducted an online study playing an experimental sequential bribery game with East and West Germans (N=168) born distinctly before and after the collapse of the socialist system in East Germany. We find a higher propensity toward corrupt behavior among young Germans who grew up in a market-oriented economy compared to the older generation who experienced either socialist or market-oriented institutional conditions. Disentangling first-round and multiple-round effects, young East Germans even reveal a greater inclination to bribe compared to their West German counterparts. We conclude that there is an aggravation of immoral behavior among young East Germans who grew up under the tense relationship between market opportunities and conveyed cultural traits of a socialist imprint. Identified immoral behavior among young East Germans may be driven by a negative effect of market-oriented institutions on moral values. "
