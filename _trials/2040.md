abstract: "Economic valuation is used as a tool to estimate the value of cultural and natural resources for policy, planning, and marketing purposes, but the calculation and meaning of the resulting numbers is heavily contested.  Part of the conflict arises because natural and cultural resources have significant use value in addition to any non-use value.  This study is designed to contribute to the literature concerning how best to increase public support for the protection of natural resources.  Specifically, this experiment sets out to determine whether or not individuals respond differently to the monetization of use and non-use value, building upon previous work which provided evidence that individuals may be sensitive to the monetization of natural resource value.  

Two studies are used to examine this topic.  In Study 1, a survey-based experiment was conducted using a sample of 1,000 United States residents through participation in the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES).  To isolate differences in reactions to use and non-use valuation, the average willingness to contact a representative, willingness to vote in favor of increased funding, willingness to donate to the National Park Foundation, and additional dollars one would be willing to pay in taxes, is compared across four groups: (i) use only, (ii) use plus monetization of use value, (iii) non-use only, and (iv) non-use plus monetization of non-use value.  Study 2 uses a sample of 500 United States residents recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk.  In this study, outcome variables are similar to those in Study 1.  However, rather than rely on stated willingness to donate, actual donations to the National Park Foundation are solicited.  In addition, participants are asked to spend some time writing a pledge to engage in pro-environmental behavior throughout the coming year.
