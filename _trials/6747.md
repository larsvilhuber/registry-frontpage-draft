abstract: "The aim of this field experiment is to estimate and compare the effects of three different kinds of informational interventions on resource use and consumer surplus: Real-time feedback (RTF), social comparisons (SC) and their combination (DUAL). In a field trial with around 600 participants, we study the effects of these interventions on showering behavior. 
Based on real-time behavioral data and a randomized experiment, we will estimate the causal effect of these interventions on water consumption per shower. Furthermore, there will be additional surveys, providing background information on the subjects and willingness-to-pay (WTP) statements for the different interventions in different points in time. A structural theoretical model will be used to aggregate all these factors to estimate the welfare effects of the interventions.
