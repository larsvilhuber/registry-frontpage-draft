abstract: "The Building Bridges and Bonds study is an evaluation of new program approaches to support low-income fathers in working toward economic stability and improved relationships with their children. The study includes tests of the impacts of the Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Justice Involved Individuals Seeking Employment (CBI-Emp) intervention. CBI-Emp was tested in three fatherhood program settings:  Kanawha Institute for Social Research and Action, Inc. (KISRA), in Dunbar and Beckley, West Virginia; Ohio Department of Job and Family Servicesâ€™ Passages Connecting Fathers and Families, Inc., in Cleveland, Ohio; and The Fortune Society in New York, New York.

The CBI-Emp intervention is designed to improve economic stability by encouraging positive thoughts, attitudes, and behaviors among individuals recently involved with the criminal justice system. The CBI-Emp approach addresses challenges associated with deficits in executive functioning by building skills in impulse control, problem solving, organization, and time management. 

The impacts of the CBI-Emp intervention will be evaluated using an experimental research design. The impact study will address questions about whether the new CBI-Emp approach affected key outcomes of interest, including increased employment."
