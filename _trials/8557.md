abstract: "Government attention to policy issues about social equity and the climate raises questions about public budgeting priorities. In the area of public service delivery, what characterizes citizens’ attitudes to local government spending focused on (a) combating race and gender discrimination and (b) promoting the climate agenda? Do citizens think that the local governments should spend more on these issues than they do today? Are citizens’ willing to accept at trade-off—e.g., less local government investment into promoting the effectiveness and efficiency of the public services? Does “fiscal illusion” mark the citizens’ attitudes to local government spending on issues relating to race and gender discrimination and the climate crisis? This study examines these questions using data from a between-subjects survey experiment among Danish residents (n = 2,000). "
