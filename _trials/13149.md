abstract: "This paper tackles the issue of ongoing food waste in school canteens. We design a case control study for applying nudge in school canteens to curb food waste. Firstly, we write a protocol for a pilot study. Then, we propose an extended protocol for a large scale experiment. Our main contribution to the research field is to provide a nudge that is interactive. It is a revisited "Climate Fresk" between searchers, school canteen staff, teachers and children aged from 11 years old to 15 years old. We expect to reduce significantly the amount of food waste during the one-month experiment."
