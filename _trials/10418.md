abstract: "We explore how to modify institutional designs to provide information needed to give workers equal opportunities in the labor market. For example, performance evaluations often discount efforts on non-promotable tasks (committee service, helping others with their work, etc.) that do not impact the firm's key performance indicators. As women hold a larger share of this unrecognized work, their performance reviews will be worse than men's due to differences in work assignments, not effort. We explore performance evaluation options to lessen the impact of differential work assignments on pay. We use a laboratory experiment to look at how providing managers time usage and productivity measures for both promotable and non-promotable tasks to impacts wages and if managers avoid these disaggregated sources of information as an excuse to better compensate efforts on promotable tasks. This project provides concrete policy recommendations to reduce the gender gap in pay and promotion.
