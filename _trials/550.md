abstract: "This project will investigate the relative importance of hard skills versus soft skills in business success and more broadly in the youth’s school-to-work transition. The project will strengthen, experimentally, the training of these skills among recently graduated Ugandan secondary school students. The goal of the current endeavor is to: (a) leverage insights from the economic and social sciences toward the goal of improving entrepreneurial success in developing countries, and (b) test whether “hard” versus “soft” skills better predict consequential entrepreneurial and business longevity outcomes, and a better performance in the labor market, particularly among young people and women."
