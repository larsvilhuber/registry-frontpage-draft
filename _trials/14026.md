abstract: "According to the UN report on ‘COVID-19 and the Need for Mental Health Action’ the “global economy loses more than US$ 1 trillion per year due to depression and anxiety”. Mental health problems, stress, and distress among women are likely to have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and exacerbated by the conflict in Ethiopia. This study aims to evaluate the impact of the “Doing What Matters in Times of Stress Guided Self-Help Manual” on mental distress, business performance, and experience of intimate partner violence among women entrepreneurs in Ethiopia. The findings of this study will contribute to the emerging literature on the impact of mindset-oriented interventions on business performance of women entrepreneurs. Additionally, it will contribute to the evidence base on the links between mental distress and women’s probability of experiencing or re-experiencing IPV. "
