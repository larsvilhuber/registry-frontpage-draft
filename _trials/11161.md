abstract: "The aim of this field experiment is to test whether study registrants in the German Clinical Trials Register can be nudged to complete their registration. 
The greatest effort for the study registrant, but also for the registry staff, arises during the initial application for registration. Afterwards, usually only a few queries have to be processed in order to complete the registration in the registry. 
In this experiment, these entries are identified and randomised into 3 groups. 2 groups receive emails with a selected nudges. 1 group serves as a control.
The primary objective is whether the study will be registered within 6 weeks of the nudge. 
Secondary objectives are 
- Feedback from the study managers (Mail or Phone)
- Changes to the study entry 
- Deletion of the study entry
- Login from the study managers
