abstract: "Effective tax policy requires understanding behavioral decision-making. We investigate reciprocity and whether misperceptions about how the government allocates funds impacts taxpaying behaviors. In a combined survey and natural experiment with 2,000 self-employed workers, preferences and beliefs on government spending are elicited. In the case when revealing the actual distribution improves beliefs, government support increases (0.30 s.d.), views on taxes improve (0.24 s.d.), and affective polarization decreases (0.40 s.d.). Participants file fewer tax returns and declare less income. When beliefs are worsened, this results in more tax returns and larger declarations. Behavioral changes are consistent with free-riding and feelings of guilt. "
