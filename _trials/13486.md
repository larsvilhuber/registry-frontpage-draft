abstract: "Information on operating costs can enable potential buyers to purchase more fuel-efficient vehicles. We test this hypothesis in a developing country setting using personalised information provision in a randomised controlled trial: we recruit respondents looking to purchase a motorcycle in Kathmandu, Nepal, and provide them information on annual operating cost-savings or five-year operating cost-savings of different models using energy labels on a unique web-based platform. We find that both information treatments were effective in improving the fuel economy of the motorcycles actually purchased by respondents, and the motorcycle that they stated they would like to purchase, with a stronger effect for the five-year operating cost savings. Furthermore, being shown the five-year operating cost savings information also made respondents buy relatively more efficient motorcycles in reality, compared to the model they indicated they would buy in the stated choice setting.  Our treatments were particularly effective with respondents of an impatient nature, or those who had low levels of energy-related financial literacy. This study provides novel evidence on the effectiveness of information provision in low-education settings, where the opportunity cost of collecting information may be high. "
