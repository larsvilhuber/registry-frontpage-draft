abstract: "This study explores how individuals perceive and respond to social inequalities based on intergroup comparisons. Specifically, we examine whether individuals tend to minimize the inequalities they experience when they observe more pronounced disparities in another group. To investigate this, a laboratory experiment is conducted where participants receive different allocations within their group and different types of information regarding the other group: no information, the wealthiest's allocation, the poorest's allocation, the level of inequality between the two players, and the actions taken to reduce (or not) inequalities within the group. By analyzing participants' responses and behaviors to this information, I seek to better understand the mechanisms of perception and reaction to social inequalities, as well as their potential impact on attitudes and behaviors towards equity and social justice.
