abstract: "Migrants from Western Africa go through risky migration routes to reach Europe. In addition, African migration to Europe often results in low economic outcomes. Potential migrants might be poorly informed about benefits and costs of migration. We then propose to use a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) to answer the following questions: (i) Are migrants are about their earning opportunities in Europe and risks connected to the journey? (ii) Can an intervention providing information about earnings and risks changes potential migrants’ beliefs and so influences their migration choices?"
