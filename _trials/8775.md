abstract: "Achieving global vaccination against COVID-19 is a critical worldwide challenge. While COVAX is planning mass vaccination of Africa in 2022, there are substantial challenges. Cash incentives have been proposed as a way to improve the efficiency and equity of the roll-out in Africa.  Recent experimental evidence suggests that financial incentives can promote the adoption of preventive health habits (Hussam etal 2022) and more specifically vaccine uptake (Campos Mercade etal 2021).  To evaluate whether cash incentives affect the willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine, we are undertaking a field experiment, designed and conducted in consultation with the University of Ghana and the Ghana Health Service.  The experiment will evaluate the impact of cash incentives on vaccine uptake."
