abstract: "We consider how expectations about an individualâ€™s mastery of a skill depend on a signal of the individual's mastery of a different skill, and whether this expectation differs across race and gender. To this end, we have designed a survey task in which research subjects make an incentivized guess about a math test score given information on a reading test score (and vice versa), when race and gender are evident in a photograph of a test taker."
