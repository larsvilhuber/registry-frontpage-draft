abstract: "Affirmative action remains highly contentious across the globe with groups receiving affirmative action being potentially subject to discrimination. However, it is hard to know whether the discrimination that they face relates to their group identity, or to their affirmative action status. If affirmative action generates additional discrimination, the welfare gain of affirmative action policies may be reduced. In this experiment, we study whether affirmative action beneficiaries are discriminated against because of their status rather than their identity, by looking at whether they are judged to be of lower ability, and allocated less money for a task, when their affirmative action status is made public. If this is the case, our design allows us to understand whether this is due to a stigma of incompetence (people assume that affirmative action beneficiaries perform worse) or a bias towards groups that receive affirmative action."
