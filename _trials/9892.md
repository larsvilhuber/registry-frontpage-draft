abstract: "This study examines the impact of learning about the climate legislation expected to be introduced in August 2022. It compares two frames. The first frame -- the victory frame -- presents the climate legislation as a historic accomplishment that is a game changer. The second frame -- the incrementalist frame -- presents the legislation as an important step in an unfinished journey. We have two primary outcomes. The first is the decision to engage in voter mobilization efforts to support climate-friendly candidates in the mid-term elections. The second is willingness to donate a share of potential lottery winnings to climate friendly groups. We also measure a number of secondary outcomes, including efficacy beliefs and attitudes toward climate action."
