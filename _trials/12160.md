abstract: "Recent studies highlight information constraints as an important barrier to technology adoption, but there is very little evidence that allows to distinguish the roles of different information frictions for adoption decisions of different types of technology. We design a cluster randomized controlled trial among 1,200 farmers in Haryana, India, to promote adoption of early sown wheat varieties and zero tillage technologyâ€”two agricultural innovations that can help farmers adapt to climate change by increasing resilience to heat and water stress. Guided by a novel theoretical framework that captures the distinct roles of two information frictions, learning and costly information processing, the experiment is designed to test whether different types of technology require different types of information provision to facilitate adoption. The insights derived from this study have strong policy implications and help in understanding the role of information frictions for adoption decisions beyond the specific technologies considered here."
