abstract: "This study will investigate the potential effects of a micro entrepreneurship policy providing asset transfers, business training and psychological training to low-income individuals in Chile on labor, income and business activity. Using a randomized controlled trial, we will evaluate the impact of asset transfers, training in addition to asset transfers and we will test whether psychological training, aiming at influencing peoples "soft skills", is more effective than traditional business training.
