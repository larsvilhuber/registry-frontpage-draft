abstract: "Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide. According to the United Nations health agency, it affects more than 300 million people around the world. Previous studies have suggested different psychological interventions to reduce the severity of depression symptoms in developing countries. In Pakistan, there has been a lack of research to address this issue and introduce measures to overcome this gap. This study aimed to develop an intervention to improve the severity of symptoms in individuals with depression in Pakistan. The purpose of this research was to cross-culturally validate the Metacognitive Training for Depression (D-MCT) and evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of delivering D-MCT to individuals within Pakistan. This study was a pre-post design, parallel two arm, double blinded, feasibility, randomized controlled trial. Sixty participants (experimental group, n=30; control group, n=30) were recruited from the departments of psychiatry of a hospitals in Rawalpindi from August to November 2022. Four instruments (Beck Depression Inventory, Metacognitions Questionnire-30, Mental Health Curriculum-Short Form and World Health Organization Quality of Life scale) were used to assess symptom severity, metacognitions, mental health, and quality of life in individuals with depression. A two-way factorial ANOVA was used to examine the efficacy of D-MCT in reducing symptom severity, metacognitions, mental health, and quality of life. The results of this study demonstrated that D-MCT was effective in reducing symptom severity, maladaptive metacognitions in patients with depression as compared to the treatment as usual. On the other hand, the results also revealed that D-MCT was effective in improving quality of life and mental health in patients with depression. This study will help improve depression treatment in Pakistan and create insight in policy makers so they can incorporate this therapy in various hospitals across the country."
