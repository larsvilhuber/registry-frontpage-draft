abstract: "We conduct a survey of firms in New Zealand to document how exogenous variation in the inflation uncertainty perceived by firms affects their price-setting decisions. We use randomized information treatments that provide different types of information about future inflation to generate exogenous changes in the perceived inflation uncertainty of some firms. The effects on their decisions relative to their initial plans as well as relative to an untreated control group will be measured in a follow-up survey three months later. "
