abstract: "
This study will assess the effect of the Graduation model in Malawi on gender empowerment and household welfare outcomes in married couples. The Graduation Model is a 'big push' intervention designed to move people out of poverty by addressing the many challenges of extreme poverty by simultaneously boosting livelihoods and income and providing access to financial services. The Graduation program will be run over an 18 month period, with the first cohort receiving the program from November 2018 to June 2020, and the second one between October 2019 â€“ June 2021. The research will estimate the impact of three distinct version of the graduation intervention, 1) the graduation program targeted at the female spouse, 2) the graduation program targeted at the male spouse and 3) the graduation program targeted at the female spouse but with an additional couple's empowerment training.
