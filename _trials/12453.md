abstract: "Between 2012 and 2015, the Government of Nigeria ran the world’s largest business plan competition, giving away $180 million in grants to over 3,500 entrepreneurs. McKenzie (2017) studied the program’s first year, using an experiment in which  729 of the winners were randomly chosen from a pool of 1,841 semi-finalists, with each winner receiving a grant of around $50,000. Four rounds of follow-up surveys between 2012 and 2016 were used to measure the impacts of this program up to three years after all money had been received, and five years after entering.  The results showed large impacts on firm start-up, growth, innovation, and employment. This follow-on project aims to track these firms and entrepreneurs another 7 years later, making it 11 years after they applied. "
