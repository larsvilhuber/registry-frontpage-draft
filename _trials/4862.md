abstract: "We explore the impact of role models on nascent entrepreneurs in the context of university students and their participation in entrepreneurship training and support program.  Our field experiment is embedded in the recruiting emails for an internal entrepreneurship program at a major research university which provides funding, mentorship and expert advice to nascent entrepreneurs to help them build their ideas into companies. We explore whether the provision of role models and characteristics of the role model like gender impact the likelihood of a student engaging with the entrepreneurship program. "
