abstract: "Our experiment investigates the fertility norms of Syrian migrants relocated in Türkiye due to the civil conflict that started in 2011, in relation to the norms of the native Turkish population. We implement an RCT evaluating an information intervention among a sample of Syrian refugees. Individuals are randomized into two treatment groups receiving information about natives’ and Syrians’ fertility and fertility intentions, and a pure control group receiving no information. We then compare the fertility intentions of the treated group and the control group immediately after the treatment and intentions and outcomes after six months. We also conduct heterogeneity analysis disciplined by a simple theoretical model of native-migrant interactions and descriptive norms. If our results align with the model predictions, we may also exploit a structural estimation to produce counterfactual scenarios on the convergence of social norms with and without native-migrant interaction."
