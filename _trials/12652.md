abstract: "This is a follow up to a lab study we conducted previously. The abstract of the lab study is this: 

A central factor when choosing an action is its causal effect on the outcome of interest. Yet, causal information is often lacking. People instead observe correlational or historical data, along with causal interpretations and recommendations provided by experts who frequently disagree with each other. Our laboratory experiments study choice in such settings, where beliefs concern the structure of the data-generating process rather than merely magnitudes. Roughly half of our subjects attempt to determine the fit of the causal interpretations to past data, as the literature on model persuasion assumes. We characterize the limits to their ability to do so. Half the subjects’ choices are co-determined by the interpretations’ promises of future payouts, as the literature on narrative competition assumes, or by the downside these choices entail if they are mistaken. Subjects also commonly employ heuristics such as Occam’s razor. The fact that they typically prefer flexibility over parsimony insures them against bad choices in some settings but has the opposite effect in others. Our estimates predict well out of sample and closely agree across two different identification strategies in two different samples. We also study the extent to which behavior is robust to framing and the relation between subjects’ choices and their political attitudes and psychological characteristics. Our results characterize the cases in which subjects’ behavioral tendencies render them most receptive to misleading interpretations. They also inform the literatures on narrative competition and model persuasion."
