abstract: "Old workers usually have lower employment rates and experience much longer unemployment spells than younger workers. This study explores whether there is discrimination against old workers in the labor market. An online experiment will be implemented to study employers' hiring decisions for workers of different ages and genders in an experimental labor market. Hiring decisions in two labor markets that require different types of skills: fluid intelligence, which usually declines with age; and crystallized intelligence, which usually stays stable over age, will be studied separately to explore the heterogeneity of ageism. Belief about productivity will be elicited to study whether the discrimination is statistical. In addition, workers' self-selection into different types of labor markets will be studied to explore whether old workers are aware of their fluid intelligence decline and can self-select into professions where crystallized intelligence matters more."
