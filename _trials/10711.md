abstract: "This study deals with fairness views of different income groups towards different types of inequality. Recent work has concentrated on views regarding inequality that is generated by luck and merit. In this work, we add to this literature and examine fairness views towards inequality that is based on someone else's taste (which we dub taste-based inequality). In an earlier study, we already examined this type of inequality alongside luck- and merit-based inequality on a representative sample of the adult Israeli population (the pre-registration of that study is available on the AEA RCT registry with RCT ID: AEARCTR-0008171).

In that study we reported suggestive evidence according to which people with below-average income treat taste-based inequality differently than people with above-average income. Moreover, it seems that the former group treat this source of inequality in a similar fashion to their treatment of luck while the latter treat it similarly to merit.

Since the previous study was not meant to examine this type of heterogeneity, the results regarding the behavior of the two income groups were underpowered in that study. For this study, we make a power calculation based on the results from that study in order to directly investigate the earlier suggestive findings.

We will run an incentivized online experiment based on the impartial spectator design (as in Almas et al., 2020). Roughly 3000 individuals take part in the experiment, out of which roughly 1140 will play the role of impartial spectators who will make redistribution decisions between two individuals with unequal earnings (570 spectators will belong to the below-average income group and 570 spectators will belong to the above-average income group). There will be three treatments corresponding to three different sources of inequality: Luck, Merit and Taste. Impartial spectators will be randomly selected into one of the three treatments."
