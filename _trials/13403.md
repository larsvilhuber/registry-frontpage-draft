abstract: "We experimentally examine how the selection process of public oï¬€icials (POs) impacts their corrupt activities via a fostered sense of entitlement. We propose that entitlement effects vary with the selection method, with ability-based selections possibly height- ening corruption, while prosociality-based ones might mitigate it. Our experimental design entails a two-stage process where the first stage involves an ability contest and a prosociality contest. The second stage is a bribery game where citizens in each group compete for a prize and can bribe the PO in charge. We control the sense of enti- tlement and its source by whether or not announcing which contest determines the appointment of POs. We analyze how various selection methods shape bribery and corruption through the lens of social norms, moral costs, and greed. Our findings offer insights into the relationship between public sector recruitment policies and integrity in governance. "
