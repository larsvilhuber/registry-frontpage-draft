abstract: "This study uses a lab-in-the-field design to assess the belief updating process for consumers when presented with varying labeling schemes that communicate food safety information in retail markets for vegetables. Vietnam offers a unique setting to evaluate how individuals update beliefs over time through consumer internalization of labeling information for several reasons. First, consumers may have had emotionally intense prior experiences that make them more likely to form biased beliefs about the overall quality of vegetables in retail markets. They might have become ill from consuming vegetables with high levels of pesticide residue or vegetables that were otherwise contaminated. Households exposed to herbicides and defoliants during the Vietnam War might also be particularly concerned about pesticide use and have biased perceptions of food safety quality in retail markets. Second, relatively few labels currently exist to signal credence qualities in Vietnam’s retail market. Three labeling schemes are of interest to this study: 1) no labels are available to signal differences in quality or food safety, 2) vegetables are differentiated by a ‘pesticide-free’ voluntary private label, and 3) vegetables are differentiated by the VietGAP certified label."
