abstract: "This project aims at investigating the long-term effects of the government project PACE (Programa de Acompañamiento y Acceso Efectivo a La Educación Superior). PACE is a preferential admission program that was first  implemented in Chile in 2014, and is targeted at children in disadvantaged schools. This research project investigates the long-term effect of PACE on graduation from higher education and labor market outcomes. At the time of registration, the research team does not have access to the long-term outcome data."
