abstract: "This study, conducted by the Government of the Madagascar’s Ministry of Social Protection and the Promotion of Women with the support of the World Bank’s Africa Gender Innovation Lab (GIL), will evaluate the impact of Madagascar’s new Productive Safety Net Program (Argent Contre Travail Productif – ACT-P) and two additions to this program: the use of productive spaces and behavioral “nudges” – as drivers of entrepreneurship and self-employment as drivers of productivity. This impact evaluation (IE) will assess the impact of ACT-P on communities’ productive assets through water-and soil management, terracing, reforestation etc. In addition, it will assess the impact of cash transfer on agricultural productivity, livelihoods and welfare of the household."
