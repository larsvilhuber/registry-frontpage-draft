abstract: "In this study, therefore, we propose to conduct a randomized control trial (RCT) to reduce single-use plastic consumption through an intervention targeted at young children to address the single-use plastic crisis. Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are considered one of the robust research designs to identify causal linkages in economics literature. Educating and fostering awareness among young children is paramount, as it offers the potential for a lasting impact.
 
In their formative years, children are highly receptive to new information and behavioural patterns. By instilling eco-conscious habits and awareness of the consequences of single-use plastics early in their lives, we have the opportunity to shape a generation of individuals who will make environmentally responsible choices throughout their lifetime. These choices can ripple through society, influencing their families, peers, and future generations.

The primary objective of this RCT is to assess the effectiveness of an intervention program aimed at reducing the use of single-use plastics among children aged 4-6 years. We aim to shape environmentally conscious behaviours and attitudes toward single-use plastics by intervening at an early age. 

We choose to target Anganwadi preschool kids in Uttar Pradesh in an attempt to study if they can inspire their parents to learn from their environmentally conscious behaviour and adopt sustainable practices in the household.
