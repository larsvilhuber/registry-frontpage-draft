abstract: "Aversion to “stigma” may contribute to low utilization of social programs, but empirical evidence of its importance is scarce. We use three randomized experiments focused on delivering labor market support to young people to test whether stigma can affect real life decisions. The first experiment recruits to a job training program using street-level marketing. The second experiment recruits unemployed youth to the same program via Facebook advertising.The third recruits for a job fair using door-to-door outreach. We randomize the recruitment message used and consider the information's effect on application and attendance rates, as well as selection on those who apply/attend.  "
