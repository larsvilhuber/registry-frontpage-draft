abstract: "Uncertainty is an inherent part of scientific knowledge and evidence remains “tentative forever” (Popper 1961, p. 280). However, it is unclear how the public responds to transparent communication of scientific uncertainty. Communicating uncertainty becomes even more challenging in the context of emerging crises such as pandemics, economic downturns or climate risks, which often require immediate changes or adaptations in people's behaviour. Scientific findings and related evidence-based recommendations are likely to change during the (early) phases of these crises and may contribute to the public's perception that expert recommendations and claims of facts are not credible or even  reflect elite attempts to advance their own agenda. A more thorough understanding of how the communication of scientific uncertainty in the context of crises and changing evidence affects people's trust is thus urgently needed. We will conduct survey experiments across three countries to assess how the explicit communication of scientific uncertainty in the context of public health recommendations in a hypothetical pandemic scenario affects participants' trust in sciences, trust in the communicator of the messages and trust in the behavioral recommendations."
