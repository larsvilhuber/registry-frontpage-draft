abstract: "We collaborate with a retail company and investigate changes in the salesworkers' compensation system. In an RCT, we study the effect of different combinations of team and individual incentives on performance. To that end, we implement two new compensation systems. The first system is solely based on workers' individual performance, whereas the second is based on both individual and team performance. We study how the different compensation systems affect revenues, turnover, conversion rates (i.e., the rate at which customers being served by salesworkers buy the firm's products), and granted discounts."
