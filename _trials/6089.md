abstract: "This study aims to understand how a mobile technology-based program, including mobile phone-based subsidized health insurance and training of community health volunteers (CHVs), improves health outcomes, access to healthcare and financial protection for low-income women and their family members in Western Kenya. The intervention, called i-PUSH (Innovative Partnership for Universal Sustainable Healthcare), is implemented by Amref Health Africa and PharmAccess Foundation. We conduct a cluster randomised controlled trial in 24 villages in Kakamega county, Kenya. In each village, we select 10 households with a child under four years old or a pregnant woman. We collect baseline data, followed by year-long weekly financial and health diaries, monthly pop-up modules and an endline survey. We also conduct incentivised lab-in-the-field experiments to elicit womenâ€™s empowerment, time preferences and risk preferences. "
