abstract: "The evaluation will assess the effects of a school-based training program, Girls 4 Health (G4H) by the Centre for Girls Education, which provides academic and social support to enable and encourage girls to pursue professional careers in education and health. We will evaluate G4H using a school-level randomized control trial in 28 schools in Kaduna State, Nigeria, in order to understand the effects on girls' grades, completion of secondary school, secondary school completion exam scores, and tertiary institution attendance."
