abstract: "These experiments seek to characterize the moral preferences of stock investors. We auction stocks though the BDM algorithm. Each participant first participates in a quiz designed to ensure good understanding of consequences of their actions. Then, participants bid for three stocks. 
- Stock N pays a given dividend 
- Stock E pays a given dividend, and makes a donation to a charity
- Stock U pays a given dividend, and takes away money from a charity fund
We use actual money in this experiment, and randomize dividends and charity values
There are 8 conditions:
- Baseline: the participant selects the charity a priori
- Baseline with donation: the participant has the option to donate to the charity directly
- Baseline with random charity: the participant does not choose the charity, it is picked randomly from one list
- Pivotal: the charity receives the transfer only if the bid is successful
- uncertainty: charity donation is random
- ambiguity: the stock takes money from one charity, gives to one other
