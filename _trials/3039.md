abstract: "The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of a double preference voting system conditioned on gender on the voting behavior of voters. The primary outcome of interest is the share of votes received by female candidates in three different scenarios: (i) when participants can cast only one vote, (ii) when participants have the option to vote for two candidates without constraints on gender, and (iii) when participants can cast one vote for a male candidate and one vote for a female candidate."
