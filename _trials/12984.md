abstract: "This research uses insights from behavioral economics to study the role of feedback formation in reducing the free-riding problem in team settings. We examine whether letting team members choose their preferred feedback mechanisms promotes higher or lower team contributions than exogenously assigning a feedback mechanism to the team. Participating in the dynamic voluntary contribution mechanism (VCM) game, team members choose between receiving feedback about their teamâ€™s progress on a regular basis (time-based feedback) or based on the achievement of intermediate milestones (milestone-based feedback). The findings from this study will contribute to the growing literature on feedback mechanisms as well as have policy implications for designing feedback in team contexts."
