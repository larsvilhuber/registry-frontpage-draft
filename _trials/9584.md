abstract: "This study consists of an information provision experiment to study whether people react differently when a governmental agency pays for COVID-19 vaccination as opposed to researchers paying. The new study exploits the fact that i) most people in Sweden are not aware of a Swedish RCT that paid people for COVID-19 vaccination and ii) the previous RCT was implemented in collaboration with a governmental organization.
