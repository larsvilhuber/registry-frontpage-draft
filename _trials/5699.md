abstract: "KiuFunza (shorthand for Kiu Kujifunza or Thirst to Learn) is a teacher performance pay program that aims to improve reading and numeracy in Standards I-III of public primary schools in Tanzania. KiuFunza has been implemented by the Twaweza East-Africa, a Civil-Society Organisation, since 2013, in collaboration with central Government ministries, the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology (COSTECH), district authorities, headteachers and teachers. 

The KiuFunza program was launched in 2013 by Minister Hawa Ghasia (President's Office-Regional Administration and Local Government, PO-RALG) and has collaborated and communicated with Government partners throughout. Education administrators and MPs have visited KiuFunza implementation schools and discussed the findings and experiences of teachers. One of the interventions tested by KiuFunza I, the direct sending of Capitation Grants to school accounts, has been scaled up at the start of 2016 by the government of Tanzania.

Minister George Simbachawene (PO-RALG) invited Twaweza to formulate a scalable version of KiuFunza in 2017, based on the teacher performance pay impact evidence from KiuFunza I and KiuFunza II. This resulted in KiuFunza III, a public-private partnership between the education ministries PO-RALG; the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology (MOEST); and Twaweza. The goal of this partnership is to jointly pilot a teacher performance pay program, with a view to scaling up if after evaluation the program is considered a success. A memorandum of understanding (MOU) to guide the effort has been signed by all parties in December 2017. The MOU mandates Twaweza to lead the preparation of KiuFunza III and coordinate the joint implementation. In 2018 the design of KiuFunza III was discussed and agreed with the Ministries.

The KiuFunza III incentive program will be evaluated as part of a randomized experiment coordinated by the RISE Tanzania research team. This research design aims to evaluate two programs: (1) the new School Quality Assurance (SQA) program implemented by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology; and (2) the KiuFunza teacher incentive program.
