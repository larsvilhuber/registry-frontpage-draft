abstract: "This study evaluates the impact of a summer learning program for students from low-income communities in the New York City area implemented by Practice Makes Perfect (PMP). This program aims to address summer learning loss through academic enrichment, tutoring, and mentoring services. Students in the program are grouped by grade level and receive services from hired teachers five hours per day, four days per week. The research team will work with PMP and their partner schools to implement a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to generate rigorous evidence of the programâ€™s impact on academic outcomes. The initial pilot phase of the RCT was implemented in the summer of 2018. This pilot was intended to lay the foundation for a larger-scale impact evaluation."
