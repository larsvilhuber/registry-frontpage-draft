abstract: "The Building Evidence on Employment Strategies for Low-Income Families (BEES) project will study up to 21 innovative programs aimed at improving employment outcomes, advances in the labor market, and economic security for low-income individuals and families. Selection of these programs (or “sites”) for inclusion in the BEES project is currently underway. Program services to be evaluated could include employment and training services such as job search assistance, job readiness services, vocational education, and coaching; employment barrier removal services such as those targeting substance use disorder and mental health; and other services aimed at promoting and supporting employment and economic security. Randomized control trial designs will be prioritized where an impact study is appropriate and possible. Any impact study will be accompanied by a corresponding implementation study, which will describe the program and contextualize the impact results. For programs of interest that are not appropriate for an impact study, BEES will pursue an implementation-only study. In total, the research team expects to enroll 12,400 individuals across multiple programs. Among the programs where an impact study will be conducted, the research team anticipates sample sizes of 800 to 1000 at each program."
