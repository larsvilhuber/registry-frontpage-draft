abstract: "Working with the developers of a mobile phone app that helps individuals track their spending, we study whether giving users regular feedback (via push notifications) on their progress relative to their budgets influences spending on bank cards and credit cards.  Users are randomly assigned to receive progress updates relative to narrow budget goals or relative to broad budget goals.  A third group is randomly assigned not to receive progress updates."
