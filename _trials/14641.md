abstract: "Smoking is recognized as a significant risk factor for various cancers, including breast cancer. Despite existing studies indicating an association between smoking and breast cancer, many women remain insufficiently informed about this risk. One published study has indicated that nicotine in cigarettes can facilitate the spread of breast cancer cells to the lungs, and secondhand smoke has been linked to breast cancer incidence among women (Terry and Rohan, 2002). In mainland China, there are over 300 million smokers, with men constituting a substantial proportion of this population. This not only increases their own risk of lung cancer  but also poses health risks to women exposed to secondhand smoke. However, many men often fail to recognize the health risks that their smoking behaviors pose to women.

Information interventions are effective strategies for disseminating health knowledge, and through regular Short Message Services(SMS), they can enhance public awareness of health risks. We aim to fill a research gap in this area, particularly regarding the understanding of the impact of smoking on women's breast cancer. We will focus on the influence of smoking behaviors and environments on women's health, attempting to reveal how information interventions can improve women's awareness of this issue."
