abstract: "Models of electoral accountability typically assume a nested principal-agent problem in which voters hold their representatives accountable not only for their own actions but also for the performance of the bureaucracy. In developing countries such as Uganda, the limited capacity of elected officials at the local level means that they cannot always control the behavior of their appointed counterparts; we argue that this may have a serious impact on how well elections serve as an accountability mechanism. This paper outlines the pre-analysis plan for a survey experiment conducted with citizens in Uganda that examine how citizens allocate blame and credit for the provision of public goods at the local level and how this affects electoral accountability. The survey experiment is the third in a series of three, with the first two experiments sampling elite citizens and local government officials in Uganda, respectively. Data from the other two experiments has already been analyzed. The authors do not yet have access to the data from the survey experiment with citizens. "
