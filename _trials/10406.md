abstract: " Previous literature has examined the relationship between people's future risk and their support for redistribution. However, people's risk 
varies according to their incomes, jobs, and family background. Hence, these discussion faces the difficulty to increase universal support regardless of people's socioeconomic background. One way to gain wide support for redistribution is to let people realize their own benefits from government policies regardless of their socioeconomic positions. Some welfare goods are given to the whole people although many people do not realize the fact. For example, although currently youth and middle-age people do not receive benefits from pension and medicare programs, all of them will gain benefits from the program when they become elder in the end.
 Motivated by this background, this study aims to answer the following question:  Does realizing such future benefits increase support for the social security system? Even though realizing their own future benefits, some may concern that they may not be able to receive benefits due to the government's bad financial management. Hence, we also examine the effect of fiscal unsustainability."
