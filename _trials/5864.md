abstract: "This survey experiment will study the impact on public opinion of describing the utility of Australiaâ€™s foreign aid response to coronavirus using different frames. The frames used will be: benefits to developing countries; health benefits to Australia; and geostrategic benefits to Australia. The impact will be measured in terms of views on Australian aid volumes and views on relaxing restrictions on migration to Australia from neighbouring Pacific countries."
