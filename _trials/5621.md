abstract: "The increasing movement of refugees crossing geographic and political boundaries to escape conflict and to search for economic opportunity presents a challenge not only to wealthy countries, but also to developing-country hosts.  With limited opportunities for wage employment in firms, the best opportunity for economic integration often lies in microenterprise. But little is known about the best way to support the growth of small businesses among such vulnerable populations: as Jayachandran (2020) notes, the empirical literature to date is ambiguous about the returns to relaxing human capital and liquidity constraints for entrepreneurs in general. This academic and policy uncertainty is even more pervasive in relation to at-risk populations such as refugees, with a high population of female entrepreneurs among them.  

To address these questions, this study experimentally evaluates the impact of an International Rescue Committee (IRC) BILLY program designed to increase employment likelihood and income of young urban refugees and vulnerable populations in Nairobi. We pursue an individually randomized controlled trial to understand how a package of bundled services compares to an experimental control group and two different treatment arms that receive a combination of services and cash grants of equivalent cost to the IRC. Moreover, the study incorporates an incentive-compatible 'choice' arm that allows us to assess the extent to which refugees have access to information about what mix of training and cash will best allow their business to succeed.

This project will evaluate the impacts of these programs on the employment status, time use, productive assets, earnings and consumption of the target population. In addition, we will examine impacts on a range of mechanisms of impact and alternative measures of well-being, ranging from mental health to perceived self-efficacy and cognitive bandwidth.  By evaluating these impacts in parallel for populations of refugees and comparably situated native residents, our study will speak to the generalizability of the existing microentrepreneurship literature onto the crucial problem of putting refugees skills to productive employment.
