abstract: "In this proposed study, we examine the roles of price framing and fetal sex information on demand for obstetric ultrasonography. Specifically, we examine the effects of framing of price information (subsidy versus price discount) and provision of fetal sex information on willingness to pay for ultrasonography of pregnant women. We implement a randomized control trial in the context of rural Malawi in which access to obstetric ultrasonography is severely limited. "
