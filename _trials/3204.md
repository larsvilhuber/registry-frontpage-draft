abstract: "Migrant workers face multiple information constraints in their foreign country of employment. Restricted information on vacant jobs increases the costs of searching for new employment. In addition, lack of knowledge about legal rights and regulations regarding changing employers, and incorrect knowledge about market conditions can further restrict labor mobility. This research seeks to test whether relaxing different types of information constraints faced by foreign domestic workers in Singapore improves their labor market outcomes. "
