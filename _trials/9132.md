abstract: "Strong future-time reference (=strong-FTR) languages (e.g., English) require a dedicated marking of the future (e.g. in English with “will” or “going to”), while weak future-time reference (=weak-FTR) languages (e.g., German) do not require to mark the future. Previous research suggests that strong-FTR languages make the future feel more distant than the present, implying that more short-term-oriented behavior occurs in areas such as saving and health. In a previous study (AEARCTR-0008477), we manipulated the use of future time referencing in the German language (weak-FTR vs. strong-FTR, respectively present tense vs. future tense marking) in order to examine its effect on pro-environmental behavior. Contradicting the linguistic-saving hypothesis, we find a negative effect of present tense marking on pro-environmental behavior. This follow-up study aims to understand the mechanisms behind the result. We will conduct a survey to investigate the potential mechanisms that explain how and why the linguistic structure used within a weak-FTR language (German) affects individual pro-environmental behavior (PEB)."
