abstract: "In Sierra Leone, early childbearing and teenage pregnancy is one of the most pervasive problems affecting the health, social, economic and political progress and empowerment of women and girls. Of all pregnancies, 34% occur amongst teenage girls (SLDHS 2008) and 40% of maternal death occur as a result of teenage pregnancy (MICS 2010).

This study evaluates BRAC's Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program, designed to socially and financially empower teenage girls by providing safe spaces for them to socialise and receive mentoring and life skills training. With networks of these girls' clubs active in five countries, BRAC combines this approach with financial literacy training, offering customized microloans that contribute to their social and financial independence. This in turn helps prevent early marriages and leads to a more stable future for the next generation. In Africa, the ELA program was previously implemented and evaluated in Uganda, Tanzania and South Sudan.
