abstract: "Our study explores the impact of a supervisor’s racial identity on how hiring managers utilize new information about racial groups to revise their beliefs regarding worker productivity. This proposed intervention is grounded in literature indicating that the identity of supervisors can influence employees’ behavior and alter their perception of their supervisor’s priorities (Jeanquart-Barone 1996; Roberts 2005; Bradley et al. 2018). Additionally, we examine whether sharing a supervisor’s racial identity shifts how hiring managers express their racial attitudes. To determine whether non-Bayesian updating among hiring managers depends on the supervisor’s racial identity, we will conduct an experiment using the Prolific survey platform. In this experiment, we will randomly present a photo of one of the supervising researchers of this study, along with a prompt. In doing so, we will leverage the racial diversity of the two researchers to assess whether belief updating about racial gaps in worker productivity and explicit racial attitudes change conditional on which researcher is shown.
