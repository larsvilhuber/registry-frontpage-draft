abstract: "Recent theoretical and empirical work on consumers’ behavior emphasizes the importance of self-control problems.  While different theories can explain self-control problems, an important part of the literature focuses on “βδ” models of time-inconsistent preferences. In those models, individuals are assumed to be either (i) sophisticated, aware of their preferences, and taking commitment measures to protect their present-self from the behavior of their future-selves; or (ii) partially or fully naïve and ignoring the inconsistency in their preferences when deciding on their present consumption. 

Both theoretical and empirical studies alike have so far focused on the “forward looking” part of the consumers: how do they choose current and future consumption, given how much knowledge they have about their own preferences and the available commitment technologies. We on the other hand want to focus on another assumption that we believe is fundamental, but yet not researched. Naïve consumers are typically assumed to ignore not only their true future behavior, but also all their past decisions. The naïve consumer that makes time-inconsistent choices is assumed unable to look back at his past choices and infer from them the true shape of his preferences.
