abstract: "Intolerance, in its various forms, undermines the fabric of a cohesive society by breeding division and animosity among individuals or groups based on differences in beliefs, identities, or ideologies. In this experiment, we propose to study whether people are willing to pay to block the views of others that they do not concur with. We design an experiment where participants rate a series of vignette-based decisions and decide whether a certain decision is personally appropriate and socially appropriate. These appropriateness measures subsequently allow us to measure whether participants are willing to pay to prevent the spread of a view that they consider personally and socially inappropriate. "
