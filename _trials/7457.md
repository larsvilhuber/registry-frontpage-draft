abstract: "Despite the immense utility that anti-COVID-19 vaccines create for individuals and society at large, recent surveys show that about 25 to 42 percent of Germans do not intend to vaccinate against COVID-19. However, high uptake rates are crucial for achieving herd immunity. We investigate the extent to which individual vaccination intentions are affected by information about the social norm towards vaccination. In particular, we plan do conduct a representative survey in Germany that elicits respondents’ beliefs about the social norm regarding anti-COVID-19 vaccination. We then experimentally correctly potentially biased beliefs through factual information provision, and investigate how this affects attitudes towards anti-COVID-19 vaccination. "
