abstract: "While there is a growing literature in both economics and psychology on the consequences of image concerns on ethical and cooperative behaviors, self-image and social-image have not been studied jointly. The first aim of this study is to investigate the linkages between self and social image. We introduce theoretically, and aim to test empirically, a new channel that helps to explain how self-image can be strategically manipulated.

It is well-known that individuals strategically preserve their self-image by manipulating their beliefs, for instance by avoiding information (Dana, Weber and Kuang, 2007, Econ. Th.). This in turn can affect the way they judge others, through what we call the “coherence principle”. This coherence can be purely behavioral (what we refer to as behavioral coherence) and/or can be informational; i.e., if an individual ignores information to manipulate her self-image, the resulting moral judgement might be shifted by the resulting lack of information (what we refer to as informational coherence). 

This experiment is designed to test the coherence principle. In order to do so we will put subjects in context where they have to judge others’ actions in different situations. In one treatment, subjects will have to judge the morality of others’ actions in situations where they do not face similar choices, while in another treatment subjects will have to judge others’ in a situation where they face similar choices. We will also introduce the informational channel in a separate set of experiments, in which observers will receive the judgement-relevant information without facing the choice. 
This setting allows us to answer the following questions:
1.	Does the judgement of other’s (pro-social or selfish) actions change when observers face similar decisions?
2.	Do subjects anticipate that other’s judgement of their action depends on the possibility that observers have to take the same actions?
3.	Does the option of accessing information on the action reinforce the coherence principle? 

The experiment will focus on the decision to give a sum of money to an NGO.
