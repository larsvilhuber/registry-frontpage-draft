abstract: "The trial is a correspondent-based audit study among Danish child care facilities. We test whether there is evidence for ethno-religious discrimination, and whether it is based on statistical discrimination. We, in exploratory analyses, will further examine discrimination in access to child cares across facilities of different ownership (public, private nonprofit, private for-profit)."
