abstract: "The experiment will elicit public preferences for peace deals among the Israeli and Palestinian public. The preferences that are elicited will allow us to identify which attributes are most important to each side, the relative importance of these attributes in terms of strength of preference or support in a referendum. By undertaking the experiment among a representative sample of  Israelis and Palestinians, we can identify the types of peace deals that are mutually agreeable (preferred to or would receive more votes in a referendum) compared to the status quo of no deal.
