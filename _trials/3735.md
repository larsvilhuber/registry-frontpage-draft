abstract: "The study investigates behavioral nudges involving "implementation intentions" — specifically, pledging and planning — to see whether these nudges might be more effective when made in a more social context where there is greater social norm enforcement and one's reputation is more salient. Specifically, the study involves work with the Harvard University Office for Sustainability to nudge students to make pledges or plans to make environmentally-conscious choices and "winterize" their dorms before the winter recess at the university, and then see whether there is a difference in winterization rates between students who received "private" nudges and students who received the nudge in "observable" contexts. Harvard University suites in participating undergraduate housing locations are randomly assigned to experimental conditions that combine a "private" or "observable" nudge / an information-only control with an ask to winterize in which winterization is framed either as a pro-social behavior or as an action yielding private benefit. After the experimental materials are distributed to students, Harvard University staff conduct inspections of each room during the university's winter recess and record whether each suite has been winterized."
