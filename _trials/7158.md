abstract: "Resource-conserving technologies are widely reported to benefit both the environment and the people who adopt them. Evidence for these “win-win” claims comes largely from modeling or non-experimental designs, and mostly from the energy sector. Using data from a randomized trial of water-efficient technologies, we contrast an experimental estimate of the technologies’ impact on water use with an ex-ante engineering estimate of water use reductions. Using detailed cost information and experimentally elicited time and risk preferences, we estimate the private welfare gains from technology adoption, and contrast those gains  using the experimental estimate of impact versus the engineering estimate of impact. A detailed account of installation success and disadoption allows us to explore potential differences.  "
