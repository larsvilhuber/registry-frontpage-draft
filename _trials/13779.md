abstract: "We propose a randomized control trial of financial inclusion interventions with 1,500 displaced Venezuelan migrants and Colombian returnees who participate in the ADN Dignidad cash transfer program in Colombia. ADN Dignidad beneficiaries receiving transfers through banking accounts or mobile money will be randomly assigned to receive monetary incentives to save or financial literacy. The objectives of the intervention are to strengthen the long-term sustainability of improved livelihoods and economic conditions derived from the temporary cash transfers and to enhance the social and economic integration of this vulnerable population in host communities. Treatment effects will be measured through a purpose-specific survey collected 1 to 3 months following program completion. The results of this evaluation will inform the scale up of financial inclusion as a complementary intervention for vulnerable displaced populations receiving cash transfers.  "
