abstract: "A feeling of being observed can lead individuals to behave more prosocially. Based on a static comparison of decision-making in public versus in private, this finding has been shown to be very robust across various domains of ethical decision-making. Social image concerns - often claimed as the underlying reason - are regularly exploited by charities, governments and firms in practice. However, many real-life applications are characterized by repeated decision-making and there are many contexts in which it is not possible (or too costly) to always ensure observability of actions. In this project, we explore dynamics of prosocial decision-making with a focus on the role of observability by means of an online lab experiment. In particular, we investigate whether observability of initial actions in a specific prosocial domain affects subsequent private decision-making in the same domain.  "
