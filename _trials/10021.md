abstract: "Millions of people in the US are eligible to vote despite past felony convictions, but their voter participation rates are extraordinarily low. In this experiment we propose to identify individuals who have felony convictions but who are nevertheless eligible to vote through administrative records of criminal legal involvement together with voter registration records. We will then work with a commercial data vendor to obtain address information for these individuals. We will further use that address information together with voter registration files to find other individuals living in the same household as the focal individual who is justice impacted. We will therefore have a set of individuals who are justice impacted, eligible to vote and unregistered; and a set of individuals who are not justice impacted, who live at the same address as the justice impacted person, and who are registered to vote. We will then randomize individuals into one of three groups: justice impacted individuals who will personally receive a mailer prompting them to register; justice impacted people who will not receive a mailer, but whose house mate will receive a mailer encouraging them to help their justice impacted loved one register; and a control group. In this way, we will evaluate the effectiveness of enlisting network members in the process of registering and turning out justice impacted people.

This project was previously registered as an extension of the project registered under this AEA number: AEARCTR-0004574 and under this OSF project: osf.io/xq8eh; we have determined that the network approach is deserving of its own project registration.
