abstract: "This document proposes a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Nairobi, Kenya to estimate the value of a statistical life (VSL). Previous work has relied on observational evidence from settings such as transportation or employment decisions to bound individuals' price elasticity of demand for reductions in mortality risk. These approaches assume that individuals have unbiased information about mortality risk, and then use objectively measured risks to estimate demand models. This study first aims to investigate the possibility that individuals have systematically biased beliefs about risk. Second, we aim to generate experimental variation to estimate VSL. We plan to implement this experiment in the context of demand for motorcycle helmets. "
