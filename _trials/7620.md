abstract: "In the US, the last 40 years have been a period of reducing tax rates on the richest members of society. These tax cuts have often had significant levels of support from the public. Why do (some) ordinary Americans support tax cuts for the rich? We test the impact of four predominant theories â€“ unenlightened selfinterest, prospect of upward mobility, trickle-down beliefs, and fairness considerations using a survey experiment. In particular, we test these theories by randomly assigning a sample of US Americans to different information treatments. We then estimate the effects of these treatments on core beliefs, articulated preferences, and elicited preferences towards tax cuts for the rich."
