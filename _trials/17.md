abstract: "This randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluates the Unconditional Cash Transfer (UCT) of GiveDirectly, Inc in Western Kenya. Between June 2011 and January 2013, GiveDirectly distributed unconditional cash transfers to 500 poor rural households. The transfers were sent to recipients' mobile phones using the M-Pesa technology. The present RCT includes three treatments: first, the transfers were randomly chosen to be sent to either the primary female or the primary male member of the household. Second, the transfers were randomly assigned to be sent as either a large lump-sum payment, or a series of nine monthly installments of the same total amount. Third, the magnitude of the total transfer to each treatment household was randomly chosen to be either $300 or $1,100. The outcome variables include expenditure, food security, assets, income and enterprise activity, intrahousehold bargaining, domestic violence, education, health, and preferences, as well as psychological well-being and neurobiological measures of stress.
