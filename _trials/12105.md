abstract: "Using an online survey of urban college students during spring 2023, we study how exogenous variation in the receipt of information on the restriction of abortion rights by State lawmakers and the US Supreme Court affects studentsâ€™ perceived sense of discrimination and fair treatment in the US. We use randomized information treatment that provides information about the enactment of antiabortion laws and the overturn of Roe vs. Wade and analyze changes in the perceived societal cohesion of treated students relative to an untreated control group.  Since the restriction of abortion rights is likely to directly impact more women than men, we expect a differential gender impact."
