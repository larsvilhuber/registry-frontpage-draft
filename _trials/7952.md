abstract: "Dockless bike-sharing is popular and provides the commuting service for "the last mile of trip". Users often make improper parking and influence the public environment and bicycle circularity. Even some parking locations are already very crowded, users still park shared bicycles here. The company needs to take manpower to carry these bicycles. In our experiment, we use machine learning to predict the destination of users' trips. If users will ride to very busy areas, we send information through app to remind them to avoid parking bicycles here."
