abstract: "Global pricing of vaccines against infectious diseases is an important determinant of global public health outcomes as it affects the production and distribution of vaccines across countries. Pricing of vaccines remains a contentious issue because there is a dilemma: ensuring vaccines are affordable to poorer countries which have a relatively high burden of disease compared to richer countries, while also providing pharmaceutical firms with sufficient incentives for the research, development and innovation of vaccines. As a result, there have been calls for equity-based pricing, where prices are based on a countryâ€™s ability to pay. Using an online randomised controlled survey experiment, we will analyse the relative effects of providing different types of information on public support for equity-based pricing of vaccines."
