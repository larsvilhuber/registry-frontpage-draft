abstract: "Around the world and certainly in Africa, city dwellers appear to differ from rural populations in their norms about gender and family. Patriarchal family structures are often followed more closely outside of cities, yet at the same time rural women frequently perform work outside of the household. This project seeks to provide causal evidence about the impacts of access to cities in rural Africa on gender and family norms. We study the randomized rollout of a program promoting urban access in rural villages in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Implemented by a local NGO called Congo Helping Hands (CHH), this `City Access Program' (CAP) provides regular weekly transportation by motorbike taxi to the city of Kananga to individuals living in rural villages surrounding the city. Our project studies the effects of CHH's programs on individuals' beliefs and values. "
