abstract: "This is an investigation of barriers to the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in the UK by small and medium-sized employers (abbreviated hereafter as SMEs). SMEs are defined as having under 250 employees. The research project was conceived prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, but will be implemented within the resumption of economic activity following the initial lockdown measures introduced in March 2020, and subsequent interventions. It is a test case to understand what encouragement mainstream SMEs need to adopt AI within their accounts payable, invoice management and book-keeping functions of their businesses, whilst also dealing with the uncertainties caused by both Covid-19 and the end of the EU transition period in December 2020."
