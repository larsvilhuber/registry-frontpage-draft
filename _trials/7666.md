abstract: "How can public sector organizations ensure and improve the performance of their services? One important factor is job design. We know that job characteristics have a sorting effect: Some individuals are more attracted to jobs involving particular job arrangements than other individuals are. Moreover, research shows that individuals’ public service motivation (PSM) and self-efficacy are significant predictors of work performance. We ask: Which job arrangements are most important for attracting these “high-performers”—people high in PSM and self-efficacy—to public sector employment?  Using a within-subjects conjoint survey experimental design among a non-probability sample of US residents (n = 1,500), this study examines how the effects of eight particular job characteristics on job attraction are moderated both by PSM and self-efficacy."
