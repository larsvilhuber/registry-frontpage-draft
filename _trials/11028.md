abstract: "The cost of transportation can present challenges for low-income Washingtonians: making it harder to get a job, maintain a job, access social services, obtain healthcare, and care for their families. Building on the District’s efforts to address cost as a barrier to transit equity—such as Mayor Muriel Bowser’s 2019 Free Circulator trial and Kids Ride Free program—the District of Columbia government and the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority are conducting a randomized evaluation of free and discounted transit fares. We will measure the impact of transit cost on low-income residents’ mobility, employment, and well-being. The findings may help shape initiatives to make public transit more affordable to low-income residents."
