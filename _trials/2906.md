abstract: "This project has two main goals: (i) to create and validate an instrument capable of measuring the subjective beliefs and expectations that teachers have about the non-cognitive development of their students; (ii) through a random trial create an intervention that informs a group of teachers about the importance of socioemotional skills in the development and future academic and professional success of students. In this way, we intend to evaluate if we are able to change the pedagogical practices adopted in classroom, the appreciation that teachers give to non-cognitive abilities and also, if these potential changes are reflected in beneficial cognitive and non-cognitive results in students of treated teachers. The data for this evaluation comes from another experiment: "Assessing the Impact of" Compass Program "on children's Socio-Emotional and Academic Skills in Brazil" that takes place in Rio de Janeiro - Brazil, with Elementary schools. During the year of 2018 there will be two data collections with teachers and students, one at the beginning and another at the end of the school year. Teachers will answer our instrument created under goal (i), and children will go through social-emotional or cognitive tasks at two points in time. Between the two research fields, randomly selected teachers will receive text messages with informative content about socioemotional skills and their importance. The other half of teachers will receive text messages with educational content unrelated to socioemotional  skills."
