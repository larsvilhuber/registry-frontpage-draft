abstract: "Economic output in most industries is the result of many individuals working together in a team. The team environment shares features present in a public good in that the team members are working towards a common goal and are sharing the rewards that result from the finalized output. Such an environment can promote incentives for free-riding, resulting in inefficient allocation of effort across team members,
diminishing the teams productivity. This paper examines the effects of having a leader in increasing the teams’ productivity. To do so, we first gather data on business school students who are randomly assigned into groups and work in high-stakes team projects as a part of their course work. We randomly encourage half of the teams to select a team leader that will be responsible for managing the team project. We then evaluate the effects of having a team leader on various outcomes such as the teams’ project grade and the self-reported quality of team meetings."
