abstract: "We conduct a large-scale randomized controlled trial in Finland by sending three types of information letters. We examine whether these letters affect healthcare use. All letters remind receivers about the importance of seeking care to treat health problems. In addition, two out of three letters provide information about co-payments in health care and inform recipients especially of a recent law reform that made curative primary care visits exempt from co-payments.
