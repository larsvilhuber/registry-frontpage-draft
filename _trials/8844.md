abstract: "Incarcerated populations have skyrocketed in most parts of the world over the past decades. How does incarceration affect people’s lives? Identifying the causal effects of incarceration has proven challenging because of the many unobservable external factors (such as pre-existing differences in personality and criminal attitudes) that threaten the validity of a comparison between incarcerated and non-incarcerated people. 
We study the psychological, social, economic, and health consequences of short-term incarceration using a randomized controlled trial (RCT). We build on the US cash bail system, which in theory provides a financial incentive for court appearance but in practice may impose a high burden for subjects with lower socio-economic status. The study offers recently arrested people who were assigned bail they most likely can’t pay themselves, and who want to participate in the study, a 50-50 chance of being placed in an “Extra-Chance” group or a “Regular Pre-Trial” group. For people randomized to the Extra-Chance group, a local non-profit organization posts their bail, so that they can be free from jail while they await their trial.  For people randomized to the Regular Pre-Trial group, the local non-profit does not post their bail, but participants can still achieve release if they can post their own bail, if someone else posts their bail for them, or if the judge removes their bail. In other words, people in the Regular Pre-Trial group experience the criminal justice system as though there were no study. We will use administrative data sources and administer surveys to study the impact of being released from pre-trial detention on participants' lives. "
