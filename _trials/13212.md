abstract: "The study aims to investigate the reasons behind the low take-up rate of the Desenrola program, a debt renegotiation initiative designed for millions of lower-income individuals in Brazil. The program utilizes state guarantees to facilitate the restructuring of debts and alleviate financial burdens among the target population. The Desenrola program operates in a digital format, and the study seeks to contribute to the recent literature on the implementation of digital programs, particularly those aimed at economically vulnerable populations."
