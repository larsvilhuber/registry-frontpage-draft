abstract: "This evaluation will examine lotteries of rental assistance in King County, WA (Seattle) for low-income households affected by the COVID-induced economic crisis. King County offered to pay 3 months of back rent to landlords of lottery winners. We will use lottery assignment as an instrument for payment of funds and study how such assistance affects housing stability. For approximately 6,000 participants in these lotteries, we will collect administrative records and initiate surveys to measure address changes, evictions, homelessness, payment of rent, financial status, and health. We are coordinating with researchers studying similar lotteries in other cities."
