abstract: "Scripted lesson plans have great potential to improve teaching practice in resource- and capacity-constrained settings, but there are risks that they undermine teachers' autonomy to cater teaching to the level of the child, especially if lesson plans require adherence to an overly-ambitious curriculum. We present results of a randomized evaluation of two different programs aimed at improving early-grade reading in poor schools in South Africa. Both programs provide teachers with scripted lesson plans and supporting reading materials, but they differ in the mode of implementation. In some schools (Training) teachers receive two two-day training sessions over the course of the year. In other schools (Coaching), teachers also receive monthly visits from specialized reading coaches. We report results on reading proficiency after two years of implementation, and conduct cost-benefit analysis to determine which intervention is the most cost-effective. To better understand why these interventions worked, we also test for changed teaching practice, such as providing regular assessment and streaming pupils by ability. Finally, we measure how the impact varies across the distribution of baseline student reading proficiency, and if this is mediated by class size.  "
