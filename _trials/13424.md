abstract: "Will the possibility of AI replacement affect career decisions for young adults? We test this using an RCT with information treatment. I leverage an online experiment to investigate how automation risk affects the attractiveness of occupations and the desirability of entering a specific occupation. The experiment consisted of one treatment group and a control group.

I am modifying a simple model by Wiswall and Zafar (2018), which predicts a lower probability of entering an occupation if the automation risk for the occupation is underestimated. While the outcome may be intuitive, I am the first to study how occupational automation risk affects the desirability of entering a specific occupation. Compared to previous work on automation’s effect on labor markets, I go one step further
and extend the literature by Autor et al. (2003) to answer how labor market outcomes change as an effect of technological development by including AI in the automation risk.
