abstract: "Our study uses a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of a mass media campaign (radio) designed to reduce pregnancy rates among Hispanic teens. The coverage areas of 28 FM radio stations (mostly Spanish-language) in California are included in the study. We randomly assigned 14 of the 28 radio stations to the treatment group and asked each treatment group radio station to air a 30-second ad 15 times per week for five weeks. In the ad, a young woman stressed the opportunity costs to teen mothers of having a baby (e.g., missed opportunities for fun, socializing with friends, or attending school). The study will estimate the effects of the intervention on births to female Hispanic teenagers in the year after the ad was aired, using birth records from the California Department of Public Health."
