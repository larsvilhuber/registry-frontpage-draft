abstract: "We will run a RCT to test the causal effect of workplace peer interactions on physician mental health and well-being. We will test the mechanisms for both the positive effects (e.g., directly buffering job stress and indirectly coping with job stress) and the negative effects (e.g., social contagion and social comparison). We will test heterogeneous effects through subgroup analyses based on these mechanisms. For example, we will test whether the positive effects are larger for the same-specialty dyads (buffering) and the female-female dyads (coping), and whether the negative effects are larger for the dyads that includes a burnt-out doctor (social contagion) and for the dyads with more power-distance (social comparison). We will compare the peer-support intervention with individual-based intervention. We will also explore the intervention's effects on performance (i.e., health care safety and quality)."
