abstract: "This paper tests whether uncertainty about future rainfall affects farmers’ decision-making through cognitive load. Behavioral theories predict that rainfall risk could impose a psychological tax on farmers, leading to material consequences at all times and across all states of nature, even within decisions unrelated to consumption smoothing, and even when negative rainfall shocks do not materialize down the line. Using a novel technology to run lab experiments in the field, we combine survey experiments with recent rainfall shocks to test the effects of rainfall risk on farmers’ cognition to test whether it decreases farmers’ attention, memory and impulse control, and increases their susceptibility to a variety of behavioral biases. Testing whether farmer’s cognitive performance is relatively less impaired in tasks involving scarce resources can provide evidence of whether the effects operate through the mental bandwidth mechanism. Last, exploiting random variation in the monthly payday of Bolsa Família (Brazil's flagship conditional cash transfer program), we will decompose the cognitive effects of uncertainty into those of risk and anticipation."
