abstract: "There is evidence that shows that gender discrimination still exists, especially in the labour market, which is related to whether women can achieve real equality. By controlling the gender and whether the fertility plan is disclosed, we plan to examine fertility discrimination in the hiring process. First, we plan to use online surveys to learn about job seekers’ (graduates’) willingness to disclosure fertility plan and the importance of fertility plan to HR’s hiring decisions. After that, we plan to invite university students who are on the job market (graduates or students who seek internship) to fill in a recruitment system. In this system, some of the information (e.g., age, gender and education background) are required, and some of the information is optional (e.g., personal interests, career experience and self-description). Besides, the fertility plan is required and there are 6 options in it – no plan, one child, two children, three or more children, not sure and reluctant to disclose. Following Kessler et al. (2019), we would generate new resumes based on the information we collect. Finally, the resumes would be reviewed by HRs and we plan to use an eye tracker to track their eye movement. After reviewing each resume, HRs need to answer 3 questions: the possibility of hiring the candidate (0-100), the salary and the contract period they would like to give to this candidate. Finally, we plan to conduct a large-scale correspondence study to examine the externality of the lab experiments. Through the study above, we expect to get the following results: (1) The willingness to disclosure fertility plans is different between men and women. The willingness of women is much lower than that of the men; (2) The importance of fertility plan that HRs have reflected is inconsistent with actual behaviour; (3) Disclosing fertility plan has negative effects (low callback rate) on women but not on men.
