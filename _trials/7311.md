abstract: "A wide range of wearable sensor technologies exist that can capture a variety of physiological and behavioral measurements that may provide valuable individualized health information. Some examples include continuous glucose and blood pressure trackers, personal environmental sensors, and lung function monitors. Today, the best known and most widely used wearable sensor technologies are comprised of a wide array of wrist-worn activity, sleep, and heart rate monitors. Market research claims one-in-five Americans use a smartwatch or fitness tracker and continuous use of these devices drops to 70 percent after 6 months of purchase and 55 percent after 1 year of purchase. This attrition limits the usefulness of wearable sensors for health research purposes, which can longitudinal data from the same individual to predict illness, such as the onset of influenza and Covid-19. We run a Randomized Controlled Trial to reduce attrition of a Fitbit wearable sensor over a one year period with 10,000 people enrolled in a health research program. As part of the study, individuals are invited to receive a Fitbit free of charge that is theirs to keep. Individuals are randomized to two long-term engagement interventions: a wear target for the device (2 conditions); and a reminder frequency condition (3 conditions). For the wear target, individuals are encouraged to wear their device at least 4 consecutive days or 12 total days per month for a period of one year. For the reminder frequencies, individuals either receive no reminders, weekly reminders or can choose their preferred cadence (twice a week; once a week; twice a month or once a month) following a 3-6 week onboarding period where they receive messages once a week. Individuals in this latter group are explicitly prompted to declare a communication frequency preference after the end of the first and sixth month of the study.

Through this design, we evaluate the number of days a device is worn in a given month as well as over the duration of the one year study period. Our work contributes to literature on the use of targets on long-term behavior change. In addition, we add insights on whether giving individuals the ability to customize reminder message frequency improves participation in the study."
