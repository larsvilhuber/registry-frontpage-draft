abstract: "In this experiment we examine how an information intervention affects people’s attitudes towards food attributes. Specifically, we focus on antibiotic use in food production. First, we test whether one-sided and two-sided messages affect consumers’ willingness to pay for the antibiotics free premium. Second, we examine the kinds of consumers that are most receptive to either of the messages. We examine factors potentially affecting a consumer's receptivity to the different messages, such as existing subjective and objective knowledge about antibiotics, their scientific literacy, their education level and their cultural attitudes. Finally, we study a potential mechanism through which the messages change people’s preferences. We hypothesize whether a person that delivers a balanced message is perceived as more trustworthy than a person that delivers a biased message and therefore the consumer is more open to contrary positions."
