abstract: "In this study we design and implement an intervention that aims to help students in their final year of compulsory education (9th graders) in Finland to choose secondary education suitable for them. We examine two versions of this Oma linja program. The "intensive" intervention consists of (a) motivational workshops and (b) implementation of social-cognitive group counselling techniques in the classrooms. The "light" intervention includes only group counselling activities.

To evaluate the impact of the program, we conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Our aim is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the impacts of the Oma linja intervention over the lifecycle of the participants. Our first set of results will examine effects on educational outcomes (application patterns, enrollment, drop-out, program changes, completion and grades in post-mandatory education).
