abstract: "This pre-analysis plan and methodology draft describes how we will design and implement a field experiment – a resume correspondence study – to measure the discrimination in hiring faced by Indigenous Peoples in the United States (American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians). We create realistic resumes of men and women applying for common entry-level jobs (retail sales, cook, server, janitor, security). We send employers resumes that either signal that the applicant is Indigenous or white, with all other resume features being the same on average. We further signal that some of the Native American applicants grew up on an Indian reservation to measure to what extent employers penalize Native Americans who grew up on Indian reservations. After discussing how we created the resumes and applied for jobs, we discuss ways that we have pre-specified our analysis to prevent concerns such as dating mining."
