abstract: "As a medium of information transmission and symbol of group identification, language is central to economic transactions and decision-making. The economic implications of language are particularly salient in developing countries, where both greater linguistic diversity and lower GDP per capita growth suggest that language barriers create economic frictions. Yet there is limited causal evidence on the effect of language on economic outcomes due to the close correlation between language and ethnicity, as well as language learning and ability. To approach this gap, I partner with an online job board in India to examine the role of language in a key economic domain: labor market matching. In an online RCT, we measure the effect of providing additional language options for jobs posts on labor market matching."
