abstract: "This project aims at exploring the role of narratives as a tool to change attitudes towards and ultimately reduce prevalence of Female Genital Cutting (FGC) in Sierra Leone. In Sierra Leone, 89.6% of women are cut (Statistics Sierra Leone and ICF International, 2014) and cultural identity seems to be one of the main factors responsible for the persistence of FGC. Drawing on work in psychology, we propose a new tool to alter the association between a person’s sense of “self” and behaviors prescribed by norms: narratives, and test if a 'narrative' can reduce support for the practice. The narrative in our study consists of a short video that makes women aware of the historical origins of FGC among slave women along the Red Sea route. We will survey 3500 mothers who have daughters aged 3-17 in 150 villages, and half of the women will receive the treatment video. We hypothesize that discovering this link between FGC and slavery may induce people to re-assess the intrinsic value of FGC and change their attitudes."
