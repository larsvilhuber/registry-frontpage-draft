abstract: "Despite evidence that switching to service-based business models might increase their competitiveness, many manufacturing SMEs experience difficulties when trying to do so. Due to lacking awareness of its potential, the SMEs often are unable to identify tools and parties relevant for successful ‘servitisation’. In order to investigate whether policy support can make a difference, a Dutch pragmatic trial issues vouchers for manufacturing SMEs to receive service design training from public or private knowledge suppliers.

Aiming at >240 applications, the RCT is designed to grant 80 submissions and reject >160 of them. An initial benchmark survey is followed up (both amongst the intervention group and the control groups) 1 month and 13 months after the treatment period terminates. This, in combination with several case studies, generates a basis for examining the extent policy-backed service design trainings truly help manufacturing SMEs to strengthen their competitiveness."
