abstract: "Other-regarding or social preferences – including altruism – are important in social interactions, cooperative behaviour and, more generally, in public life and politics. Previous literature has shown some evidence of the effects of information treatments on policy preferences, although the results are mixed. In light of the strand of literature showing that some individuals perceive inequality in absolute terms while others perceive inequality in relative terms (note that the most widely used measures are based on the latter), we examine whether the framing of information about inequality in absolute or relative terms affects altruistic behaviour. 
We implement this economic experiment together with other games and a survey to collect background information on participants in both Mozambique and Vietnam.
More details are provided in the pre-analysis plan."
