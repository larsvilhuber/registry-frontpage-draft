abstract: "Prevailing stigmas can lead to discrimination against specific groups. When people become aware of their biases and the effects of their biases (i.e., causing harm, being perceived negatively by others), research suggests they will experience guilt. As a negative affective state, people are motivated to alleviate their sense of guilt. One particularly effective way to induce guilt for biases is to confront, or call-out, someone’s prejudices. Research on prejudice confrontations has consistently demonstrated that people confronted for their prejudice report feeling guilty, which is in turn associated with self-regulation of biases in the future, including reducing the use of stereotypes and increasing compensatory behavior (Chaney & Sanchez, 2018; Czopp et al., 2006; Mallett & Wagner, 2011). Thus, guilt has the potential to create reflexivity and critical examinations of one’s own actions and biases. In the context of the police this can lead to unbiased investigation and better treatment of women reporting gender based violence cases -- offenses where officers tend to exhibit biased cultural norms towards victims.

The project aims to implement a field experiment with approximately 355 police officers in India using confrontation of mis-handled gender-based violence (GBV) cases as an intervention to evoke guilt, and in turn promote more positive future responses to GBV crime. It ties together insights and expertise in causal inference and field experiments from development economics, with the study of countering discrimination and prejudice from social psychology.
