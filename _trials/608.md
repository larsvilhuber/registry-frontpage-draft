abstract: "This paper reports the results of a large-scale field experiment to study how personal consumption expenditures respond to credit shocks. I design a controlled trial implemented at a large European retail bank in Turkey that constructs a randomized credit limit increase, on average, $1,600, or 145% of average monthly income. The intervention deliberately and temporarily pauses the internal underwriting process for a randomly selected subset of 45,307 customers preapproved for a lender-initiated credit limit increase, creating a counterfactual withheld from receiving the limit increases for nine months. I then use the experimental shock in conjunction with rich administrative data on spending, contract choice, and balance sheets to track the impulse responses and estimate average and heterogeneous treatment effects—marginal propensities to borrow and spend—by comparing cardholders who receive the credit line extension at different times."
