abstract: "In the era of artificial intelligence, humans will become the users of machines, some repetitive task and pure memory of knowledge will become relatively less important, and the powerful role of “thinking” will emerge. By then, one of the main purposes of learning will become to cultivate a series of core qualities and abilities that machines do not possess, rather than simply acquiring and memorizing knowledge. Therefore, education that meets the needs of traditional large-scale industries needs to be reformed to better meet the needs of social development, and to promote and lead human society to a better future. How to cultivate students’ emotional processing, deep communication, perception, creativity, innovation, insight, practical ability, leadership, organization, imagination, and independent thinking? What kind of means should be used to carry them out? These should become the questions that all teachers and parents need to think about in the era of artificial intelligence. This research plans to conduct a field experiment in the pre-requisite course of economics for high school students on the digital education platform of Guanghua School of Management, Peking University. Students will be randomly divided into two groups. Students in the control group will receive feedback on scores and objective answers to questions after each submission of homework. Students in the treatment group will additionally receive personalized feedback of their homework. Specifically, the treatment group wil be further divided into subgroups, in which we will provide neutral personalized feedback, positive feedback on their curiosity, or positive feedback on their creativity. After the course is over, researchers will send surveys to follow the students’ long-term effects. "
