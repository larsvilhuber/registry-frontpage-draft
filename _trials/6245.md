abstract: "We study whether market exchange can promote and transmit the values held by market participants. Specifically, we test the conjecture that consumers prefer to exchange with sellers whose behavior reflects consumersâ€™ values and that this, in turn, leads to public support for those values by counterparts seeking improved market outcomes. We conduct a survey experiment in which UK sellers interact in a market activity with Chinese consumers with misaligned values. Our hypothesis is that the UK sellers will shift their views on a statement related to democratic values when the opportunity to trade with a Chinese consumer arises. In particular, they will shift their views towards the direction that caters to values held by Chinese consumers."
