abstract: "A vast literature in economics documents large differences in health outcomes by gender, race, wealth, and religion. To what extent these differences are driven by biases of health care providers is less understood. In this study, we explore whether health care providers discriminate against people with different religious beliefs using an audit study design (standardized patient method) on the clinical case of tuberculosis, an illness that is still widespread in Indonesia. The audit study is conducted in three provinces of Indonesia â€“ Sumatera Barat, Sulawesi Utara and Jawa Tengah. The study covers 400 doctors at 400 randomly selected primary health care facilities in these three provinces. We conduct 1,600 standardized patient visits in which we vary the religious belief the patient. We complement the audit study with detailed facility- and doctor surveys in order to study the underlying nature of the observed biases. "
