abstract: "We propose a study on the effect of an information campaign on the demand for public sewerage services in District 8 of the city of El Alto, Bolivia. A public financed sewage system was put in place in the area between 2014-2015, but, a representative household survey collected between July and August 2017 showed that the percentage of households connected to the system was 57%. As part of the project, a social marketing strategy was designed to boost household level connectivity to the sewage system in the area. The information campaign provided information about the benefits of connecting to the system, as well as information about how to connect (costs, providers, etc.) using mass communication strategies, street fairs, community meetings and home visits. We propose a randomized controlled trial to estimate the effect of the campaign on sewer connection rates. Results from this study will contribute to the scarce evidence of the effectiveness of information interventions to boost connectivity in low-income urban contexts.     "
