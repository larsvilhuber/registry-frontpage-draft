abstract: "This project will examine the causal effect of neighborhood inequality on social capital. To estimate this effect, we will leverage a lottery that generates exogenous variation in inequality at the neighborhood level. We will combine this natural experiment with an online survey to collect survey and behavioral measures of social capital. "
