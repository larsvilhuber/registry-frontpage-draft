abstract: "In this project, we analyse how different policy framings affect citizens' acceptance of urban tolls in two major European metropolitan areas: Paris-Ile de France and the Berlin-Brandenburg agglomeration. Furthermore, we investigate heterogeneity in views based on urban vs. suburban residence, trust in institutions and political views. To this end, we implement a large-scale survey of a total of 4000 urban and suburban households, representative for gender, education and age across the two metropolitan areas with the survey company respondi/bilendi. Within the survey, we randomize in-built video treatments to inform respondents of the tollsâ€™ expected effects on (i) air pollution, (ii) time savings or (iii) greenhouse gas emissions. The effects of the treatment videos on support for an urban toll are compared to a control group, which receives a video with largely uninformative content. The research design allows testing a range of hypotheses with regards to the effects of the different treatments on policy support, including across different population groups (e.g. urban vs suburban, Berlin-Brandenburg vs Paris Ile de France) as well as hypotheses relating to interactions of these main hypothesized effects with several individual characteristics, such as political attitudes and mobility behavior."
