abstract: "Each poor person cannot buy urban services alone. Many important urban services are utility or network goods, that are only viable to supply at scale, meaning that each customerâ€™s access depends on the take-up and payments of others. This experiment uses a group-level incentive to address this collective action problem in the context of grid electricity, where high theft and other losses limit investment and supply. The hours of power supply to each neighborhood will be explicitly linked to aggregate payment rates from that area so that higher-paying groups can earn more reliable supply. We test how the response to this incentive in terms of collection revenues and power supply varies with neighborhood size and composition."
