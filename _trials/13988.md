abstract: "This research studies the impact of platform ranking algorithms on consumer beliefs, and behaviors in product discovery, search, and purchase, as seller price competition. I conduct a field experiment focusing on the demand side to disentangle the impacts on consumer beliefs from consumer search costs. The experiment divides participants into four groups, varying in the belief elicitation process and product ranking algorithm. The experiment data will be used to estimate a structural model that incorporates two-sided markets and platform design in ranking algorithms."
