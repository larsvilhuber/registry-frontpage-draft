abstract: "We attempt to answer two key questions. First, How does gender composition of micro-entrepreneur teams affect business performance? Second, how do prosocial expenditures, gender attitudes and time use are affected by female participation in microenterprises. In answering these questions we exploit two margins of comparison: We compare outcomes for female and mixed gender teams with (i) all-male teams, and (ii) prospective micro-entrepreneur teams (all female and mixed gender, respectively) in control villages.

The main outcome variable is business performance, measured by administrative and self-reported data on revenues and recharge frequency. The secondary outcome variables are gender attitudes, aspirations, prosocial expenditures, and time allocation. To answer these questions we implemented a clustered RCT in two districts in Rwanda. The intervention entailed recruiting teams of micro-entrepreneurs experimentally varying their gender composition: all-male, all-female, and mixed-gender (2 males, 2 females).
