abstract: "This study addresses accessibility gaps in higher education by examining the effectiveness of financial incentives to increase participation into 529 college savings plans. The research employs a randomized trial to analyze the impact of different incentive amounts compared to an information-only group. The studyâ€™s findings will provide novel evidence on whether upfronting financial benefits can improve participation into available programs that increase social mobility, especially among lower income households, and will also offer insights for policymakers seeking to enhance economic equity through savings interventions."
