abstract: "This is a pilot field experiment with an expected sample of 2100 potato farmers in Punjab, Pakistan, to investigate the role that dynamic price information and output market linkages play in improving the economic return to small farm-holdings. Our treatment consists of updated wholesale market price information and a digital directory of wholesale auctioneers. The intervention will be provided as a bundle consisting of a mobile phone application, a call center support service, and an SMS system. "
