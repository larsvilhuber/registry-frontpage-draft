abstract: "Do individuals trust experts' advice? Does the sector these experts represent matter for trust and compliance? We will answer these questions by means of an online survey on a sample of respondents from Bahamas, Barbados, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guyana, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, Suriname, Trinidad & Tobago, and Uruguay. We will study if opinions on risk-mitigating actions against Covid-19 are shaped by expert recommendations and the sectors they represent."
