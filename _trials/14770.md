abstract: "This study aims to identify whether information provision about the cost of possessing and using a private car increases the willingness-to-pay for a public transport ticket. In a survey experiment among around 4,000 participants, we elicit the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a public transport ticket in a revealed preference second price auction. In addition, we test if providing participants with information about the cost of their car ownership increases their WTP."
