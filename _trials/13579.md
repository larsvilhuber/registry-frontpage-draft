abstract: "The integration of refugees is a challenge for host country governments. Refugees often face barriers to integration, such as discrimination, uncertainty, and restrictions on their freedom. Many of these challenges are exacerbated by high rates of mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Despite the urgent need for psychological care, refugees and asylum seekers are underdiagnosed and often do not receive adequate treatment. 

While poor mental health can hinder the integration process, there is limited evidence of the effects of psychological interventions targeting refugees and asylum seekers on their mental health, well-being, and social and economic inclusion in host countries. In this project, we use a survey among refugees and asylum seekers in Switzerland and a randomized trial of a low-intensity, peer-based, and scalable psychological intervention called “Problem Management Plus” (PM+) to study these questions. PM+ consists of five sessions delivered by trained non-specialists (“helpers”) in which recipients learn different stress and problem-management skills. We will evaluate an augmented version of this intervention, which includes three booster sessions and a digital support program.  

The existing literature identifies emotional regulation as a potential mechanism through which improved mental health can affect economic choices. To shed light on this mechanism, we use a cross-randomized priming intervention and hypothesize that PM+ affects the participants’ risk preferences by reducing the perceived risk of daily economic choices."
