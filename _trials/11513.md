abstract: "Computational research on social networks has recently made progress in the understanding of how particular structural patterns emerge from individuals' tie-selection rules. It also has identified certain key network positions for the spread of epidemics and information. However, these models rely on idealized behavioral assumptions, such as perfect network information and awareness of the relevance of one's network position, which require systematic empirical test. Here, cognitive research on social network representation and memory has shown that individuals tend to have inaccurate perceptions and representations of the patterns of connectivity in their own social groups. Unfortunately, this research does not consider whether individuals--i.e., network brokers--who occupy particular network positions are aware of their own structural relevance for diffusion.

In this laboratory experiment, we aim to understand whether individuals who i) connect disconnected others in their personal networks and ii) have direct experience as network brokers are more likely to choose the network broker as the best starting point for a diffusion process in an artificial network. Subjects will be students and their previous experience as network brokers will be estimated before the experiment from ego network data collection and from a 16-item questionnaire, 12 of which were used in previous research. In the treatment group, subjects will be asked to choose through which node they expect information will transmit to most other nodes in the shortest time. In the control group, they will observe the same network, but had to select the node that is expected to spread an infection to the whole network in the shortest time. In both groups, subjects will be exposed to two compelling nodes: A "hub," which is a highly connected node that serves as a red herring; and a broker, which connects two dense communities. We expect that in the control group, there will be no difference between brokers and non-brokers choices. In the treatment group, we expect that brokers will correctly select the broker, while non-brokers will more frequently choose the red herring. Drawing from the network cognition literature, we expect that subjects with previous experience as network brokers will be aware of the structural importance of brokers in spreading information, but not in case of virus diffusion, which is a non-intentional process."
