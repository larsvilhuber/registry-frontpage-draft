abstract: "We describe the analysis plan for an online intervention designed to learn the historical views among different demographic groups in the US and to determine whether enquiring about these views has an effect on political attitudes. Additionally, we are interested in examining how these patterns and effects vary by race and political ideology. The study will be conducted online with 1600 participants, half of which will be African American, while a quarter will be white conservatives. Participants will be asked to share their views on various historical issues pertaining to race. The order of the questions will allow us to examine whether asking participants to share and support their beliefs on various historical issues has an effect on political views. These historical views will also serve as the basis for a treatment that we will implement in a subsequent round of data collection. We outline the study design, the treatments, and the main heterogeneous treatment effects that we will examine."
