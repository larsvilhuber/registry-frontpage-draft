abstract: " Mental health issues have large economic effects, yet care for such illnesses is severely underfunded in the developing world. This pre-analysis plan details the layout of a program to train hair dressers in Abidjan to act as first responders to women manifesting mental health issues. 150 hair dressers will undergo a three-day training event in November, 2022, run by African medical professionals. Each hair dresser, along with another 150 hair dressers who applied to the event but were not selected, will be interviewed along with five regular clients on three separate occasions, before and after the training. Field interviews will seek to collect information on both first stage (access and use of trained listeners) and second stage (well-being and depression scores) primary outcomes, as well as secondary outcomes (labor, gender norms).
