abstract: "This field experiment tests an intervention to reduce littering in waste disposal areas in community houses in Vienna/Austria. Community houses differ in size from about 20 apartments in some houses to over 2000 apartments in other houses. The inhabitants take away their garbage bags in shared waste disposal areas. Waste disposal areas in community houses are often littered. This problem causes monetary costs for cleaning personnel as well as psychological costs for residents who feel disturbed by litter in this area. In this study, we test instruments to reduce littering in these waste disposal areas in a cost-effective way. We test four different nudges in this study. Currently, there is little evidence on how best to engage inhabitants of those community houses to preserve cleanliness in the shared waste disposal areas. In a randomized controlled trial, we test four interventions in around 560 waste disposal areas in over 90 different community houses. In a control group, there will be no poster and everything as is. The interventions are posters that will be placed above the garbage containers. Besides two classical nudges that work with pictures of landscapes or watching eyes and on a more subconscious level (system 1), there will be two posters focusing on raising awareness for the injunctive norm and the negative monetary consequences of littering (system 2). Our outcome variable is the tidiness/messiness of the waste disposal areas. We shoot pictures three times; before, shortly after hanging up the posters and after a couple of weeks. This way, we have a proxy on messiness at the baseline level, short-term effects, and long-time effects of the different interventions. The four treatments allow as to compare not only the intervention group to the control group but also make comparisons concerning effectiveness across different interventions. "
