abstract: "This study aims to gain a greater understanding of heterogeneity between individuals in willingness to experiment with new technologies, how dispersed information on willingness to experiment is within a community, and how that information can be used to allocate subsidies for new (experience-good) technologies in a way that enables learning about the potential returns to the technology faster and thus maximizes long-run technology adoption. Our experiment focuses on an agricultural hip-pump designed to be used for vegetable growing during the dry season. The experiment will consist of several possible "introductory subsidy schemes" randomized at the village level. Within a village, farmers whose land is suitable for pump use will either be a) randomly assigned to receive a voucher for a free pump, with uniform odds b) randomly assigned to receive a voucher for a free pump with the odds depending on willingness to pay (either in cash (b1) or in time (b2)), or c) be randomly assigned to receive a voucher for a free pump with the odds depending on otherâ€™s views on that individual's willingness to experiment. We will compare, across treatments, short-term usage of the pump, knowledge of the pump within the village, long-run adoption, and vegetable farming income among adopters and non-adopters. "
