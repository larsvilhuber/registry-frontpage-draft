abstract: "Milk and milk products serve as vital sources of nutrition, particularly rich in calcium essential for bone health. Amidst rising consumption, concerns persist regarding microbial contamination, especially in fermented milk products. In Senegal, informal milk processors commonly employ suboptimal practices, while powdered milk imports dominate the market, lacking transparency in labeling. To address these issues, we conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Dakar, Senegal, to assess consumer preferences for fermented milk safety labeling and origin. Our study aims to determine consumers' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for tested versus untested and for local versus imported fermented milk, examining socio-economic influences. Targeting urban fermented milk consumers, our RCT involved 800 participants across four markets. Using the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) auction method, we elicited bids for different milk types, considering labeling information. Our findings shed light on consumer preferences amidst safety concerns and market dynamics, particularly concerning small-scale urban processors. This study contributes to filling critical gaps in the literature and informs policy and industry practices in the local dairy market."
