abstract: "Abstract:
Maze intelligence  scale is a non-verbal  designed to evaluate psychological planning capacity and foresight. It consists of mazes with varying amount of difficulty so that participant can solve it.The test is appropriate for the age group of three and upwards. The motive behind this intelligence scale  is to assess the performance level, decision making, problem solving and cognitive functioning of participant’s when they are placed under pressure and non-pressure condition when there is no reward or pleasure. This intelligence will be conducted by providing  different mazes  to participants under different conditions. We will select our participants for the scale through Random sampling. Material required for scale  consist of mazes, pencil, and stopwatch. In pressurized situation, participants  will complete maze in allotted time, and we will record that time. In non-pressurized  situation participants can take as much as possible for them to complete maze. In last situation we will only record time  and provide rewards to some of tests  and  observe their behavior in presence of reward or no reward. There are different theories supporting our scale such as Edward Tolman theory,Thorndikes theory, Porteous Maze test, Mori’s water maze,Oltan and Samuelson, Small theory.
