abstract: "The Chinese government is imposing drastic lockdown measures on its population, limiting individuals' freedom of movement. Previous research predominantly focuses on the impacts of social distancing on disease spreading, yet the associated social consequences of lockdowns have been largely understudied. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 epidemic, this study aims at understanding peopleâ€™s behavioral pathways for leisure demand in the post-pandemic phase. Specifically, we wish to understand how people construct their leisure demand based on their perception of behaviors of peers living in their close geographic proximity. In addition, we investigate their responses to precautionary measures implemented by local businesses."
