abstract: "The online travel agency (Trip.com) conducted a study from July to September 2024. It randomly divided its platform consumers into two groups, A and B. Group A served as the control group, with no changes to the platform interface. Group B was shown labels for low-carbon flights (the top 20% of flights with the lowest average carbon emissions per seat on each route). We examined the heterogeneity in selecting low-carbon flights among different demographic groups and regions and the underlying mechanisms driving these behaviors. Based on the mechanisms and effect magnitudes we have identified, we made some pricing and design recommendations for airlines and platforms to encourage the selection of low-carbon flights."
