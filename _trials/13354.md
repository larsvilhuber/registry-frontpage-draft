abstract: "Poor mental health among displaced populations is a widespread problem. Even where mental health (MH) care is available, uptake is limited by fear of stigma, and shame as well as by informational and language barriers. This randomized controlled experiment evaluates an anti-stigma intervention at scale implemented through social media promoting mental health uptake in a vulnerable population. The intervention focuses on Ukrainian refugees in Germany, a large group of displaced individuals with extensive access to digital services, and in a context where both cost and language barriers to access mental health support services are low. The study aims to test the impact of alternative messaging and dissemination strategies to increase the uptake of formal MH care.  More specifically, the evaluated intervention puts three elements together. First, an easy-to-use Telegram bot was built specifically for the project to recruit first-order study participants (“seeds”), randomize seeds into nine groups, engage users to watch a video and facilitate the dissemination of the bot. 
Second,  videos are displaced in the bot to encourage help-seeking behavior and refer to a hotline and thirdly, a hotline run by Ukrainian-speaking medical professionals provides an accessible gate of entry to available mental health care. Our research is primarily designed to measure which video and dissemination strategy leads to more engagement with the hotline. The study builds upon existing knowledge on effective and cost-effective interventions to increase MH care uptake and aims to further reduce knowledge gaps by testing alternative approaches in a common, real-life setting.
