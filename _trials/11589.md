abstract: "In many Global South countries, the efficacy of in-person extension systems in providing tailored and timely agricultural information to smallholders and fostering their adoption is constrained by various factors. These include the high cost of reaching farmers in remote villages, limited mobility and interaction of agents with farmers, and the poor delivery of context-specific information. Digital advisory services (DAS) have advanced to overcome these challenges and improve upon the existing face-to-face extension model by reducing the cost of linking farmers with extension officers, delivering tailored and timely advice, and reducing inequalities in access to information, knowledge, and technologies. 

This study is a four-arm cluster (village) randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating the impact of three DAS delivery models on three outcomes: awareness and knowledge of SLMPs, adoption of SLM practices, and their impact on crop productivity. This study uses an agricultural information app, farmbetter, as a proxy for DAS. The study will be conducted  in Uganda and India. The interventions are as follows: (1) Agent-only treatment, where the extension agent will use the app and deliver the information to farmers; (2) self-service treatment, where the farmers will use the app independently; and (3) hybrid treatment, where both the farmers and the extension agents will use the app. The unit of randomization is a village in both countries. There are 40 clusters (villages) per arm, and the outcomes will be assessed in 12 households per village in Uganda and about 11 households per village in India. The control villages will be at least 50 km away from the treatment to reduce information spillover.  Baseline data will be collected at the beginning of the study and end-line data will be collected after three growing seasons to measure the impact of DAS on the three outcomes. 

Findings will explore the most effective DAS delivery approach among the three. Effectiveness will be measured based on the effect on the adoption of SLMPs and the impact on agricultural productivity. This will contribute to the design of DAS in developing countries.
