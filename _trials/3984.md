abstract: "We study the effects of various elements of supervisory communication - peer performance information and subjective feedback - on the effort and performance of individuals. To do so, we randomize the provision of such communication elements during a simple online game of visual perception. The game is advertised as a challenging game of self-improvement using social media outlets. We study the effect on various outcomes: intensity of play and number of games played (effort), as well as accuracy and game score (performance). We study the mean effect on players, as well as the effect on subgroups based on task-related confidence and gender."
