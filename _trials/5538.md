abstract: "Reduced transit fare programs targeted at low-income people are increasingly prevalent. This study employs a randomized-controlled trial to select a group of low-income residents in King County, Washington to receive up to six months of free public transit. This experiment will study the effect of fully-subsidized public transportation on travel habits, employment, and a series of secondary outcomes, including the use of public benefits, health, residential mobility, criminal justice, and well-being.
