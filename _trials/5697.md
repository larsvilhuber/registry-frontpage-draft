abstract: "We test the effectiveness of learning about role models on prosocial behavior. Specifically, we randomly assign participants to watch either a positive or negative video of the behavior of either citizens or politicians in the current corona crisis. We then measure the causal effect on prosocial behavior, as measured by donations and interest in volunteering.   "
