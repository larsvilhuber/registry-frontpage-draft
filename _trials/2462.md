abstract: "We aim to assess different incentive schemes to motivate for active transport in urban areas by using approaches drawn from the behavioural economics literature. In this randomized controlled trial in the field, we test the impact of different monetary incentives on cycling activity. 
Participants' trips are monitored through a mobile app which allows to quantify all transport activity including cycling during, before and after the experimental period. The paper compare the effect of a riskless and flat rate incentive for all, with the possibility for few to win a large sum of money through a lottery. All treatments are compared to a control group who is using the app without cycling related incentives. "
