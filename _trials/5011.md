abstract: "White males occupy most high-profile positions in the largest U.S. corporations. Many firms have set ambitious goals to increase demographic diversity among employees, but there is a dearth of empirical evidence on effective ways to do so. We run a large field experiment with a Fortune 500 company of over 15,000 employees to test several approaches suggested by the literature. By randomly varying a small portion of the content in recruiting materials seen by over 6,000 prospective applicants in two different populations at different stages in their career progress, we test different types of signals aimed to increase interest from racial minorities and women.
