abstract: "The trial addresses the impact of leadership training on business productivity.
The businesses are 3 years old or less, and are employers but have fewer than 20 employees.
The intervention forms part of the UK government sponsored trials programme: Business Basics Fund. It is one of five full trials in the first round of programmes (others are proof of concept trials)
The trial will be completed in 12 months. The training will be completed in the first six months; the research will be completed and reported upon within 12 months.
The measures collected during this period are proxy measures for productivity.
Identifiers of treatment and control groups enable longer term tracking of direct measures of productivity."
