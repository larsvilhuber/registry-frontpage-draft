abstract: "This study looks at:
* Determining whether a ‘pure’ reminder is more effective at increasing survey completion in a health research program than a reminder that also communicates the content of the survey and its impact.
* Determining if there are any spillover effects of being in a given reminder group (business-as-usual 2 reminders; larger set of pure reminders; larger set of reminders including information on survey impact and content) on subsequent participation.

The All of Us Research Program (AoURP) is an ambitious effort to gather health data from one million or more people living in the United States to accelerate research that may improve health. The aim is to help build one of the most diverse health databases in history. Researchers will use the data to learn how our biology, lifestyle, and environment affect health. This may one day help them find ways to treat and prevent disease. Understanding the health conditions, lifestyle and environmental conditions of participants are key pieces of information for researchers.

PPI 1-3 are important surveys in which AoURP collects data about the demographic background, health history and lifestyle information about our participants. The Basics survey (PPI 1) informs us of key information about the participant, including their age, race, gender, and education level. The Overall Health (PPI 2) survey asks participants about their physical and mental health backgrounds, which enables researchers to understand the health conditions of the AoURP cohort. The Lifestyle (PPI 3) survey asks about the habits of the participant, including smoking, alcohol, and recreational drug use habits. After primary consent completion, roughly 85% of participants complete the Basics (PPI 1) survey (calculated over December 2019 to November 2021). This number drops to 50-51% for PPI 2 and 3, resulting in an overall PPI 1-3 completion of 50%. This experiment aims to determine if additional reminders and variations in the reminder content can encourage more participants to complete the PPI 1-3 surveys.
