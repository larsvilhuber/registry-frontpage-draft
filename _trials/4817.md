abstract: "We compare the tax compliance effects of two different tax enforcement policies, a relatively costly desk/correspondence audit and a cheap information treatment with a letter asking filers with “risky” filing behavior to take a second look at their tax returns. To assess the total effect of these enforcement policies, we need to take account of both their immediate effects and their long term effects on future filing behaviour. Audits will detect and correct non-compliance on the spot, but may also change subsequent filing behavior. A letter will not disclose non-compliance, but (some) taxpayers may adjust their filings. A letter may also have long term effects on tax compliance. Based on the short run effects of both treatments, which are easy to measure, we describe how we will test the behavioural effects on future filing. We describe the intervention and lay out some important decisions with respect to coding of variables, definitions of samples and the empirical strategy we will apply. "
