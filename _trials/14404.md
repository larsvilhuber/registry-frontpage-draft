abstract: "The Wilson Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunities (LEO) has partnered with the Boys & Girls Club of the Northern Indiana Corridor (BGCNIC), located in South Bend, Indiana, to evaluate their academic and emotional well-being (EWB) enrichment program. Their academic and emotional well-being enrichment program builds upon the usual after-school club experience, combining STEM, literacy, and social-emotional learning components into a single learning program. BGCNIC identified Club members for the program if they are in kindergarten through fifth grade. Historically, the rate of chronic absenteeism for many of the districts served by BGCNIC is well above the state and national averages, and the percent of students testing at or above proficiency in literacy and math is much lower. A key component of this program is the provision of a safe space for young children to learn and develop self-regulatory behaviors that may prove to have an impact on their academic outcomes.
To evaluate this program, we will use a randomized control trial (RCT) to examine whether the program improves grades, test scores, school attendance, and behavioral outcomes. Eligible students are randomly assigned to one of three club tracks: a control group, social-emotional learning (SEL), or SEL plus academic programming, with approximately 600 in each group. The study will utilize administrative records from Indiana Department of Education, relevant school districts, and BGCNIC program data. Results from this RCT will be disseminated to policymakers and providers across the country to inform the replication and expansion of programs designed to support under-resourced children. We plan to enroll approximately 1,800 people in the study over three years (academic years 2024-25 to 2026-27)."
