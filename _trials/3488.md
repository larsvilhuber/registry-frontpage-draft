abstract: "The purpose of this study is to develop a content area literacy intervention and to examine near transfer effects on first- and second-graders’ science and social studies domain knowledge and reading motivation and far transfer effects on reading comprehension and reading engagement. The Model of Reading Engagement (MORE) lessons provides teachers with 20 lessons that (a) give students access to complex and conceptually-related science and social studies content through engaging texts, (b) extend content learning through integrated, standards-aligned reading and writing activities, (c) attend to student motivation and engagement through a variety of strategies (e.g., choice, collaboration), and (d) increase exposure to content vocabulary through home book reading activities. The randomized controlled trial tests the efficacy of an augmented MORE curriculum.  First the curriculum expands builds upon the existing 10 science lessons and adds an addition 10 lessons focused on social studies.  Second, using technology as a tool we personalize gamified reading activities based upon common early literacy screeners through a software application."
