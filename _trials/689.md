abstract: "In 2010, Tanzania discovered natural gas reserves off its southern coast worth roughly fifteen times its annual GDP at prevailing prices. The large literature on the resource curse suggests this new gas discovery brings considerable risks to a low-income country with already weak governance institutions. How should Tanzania manage this new revenue to avoid the traditional resource curse? We will report on multiple rounds of a nationally representative opinion poll soliciting ordinary Tanzanians' views on how to manage and spend gas revenues.  Between polling rounds, a random subset of poll respondents will receive detailed information about the natural gas discovery, and the pros and cons of various gas policy options.  A randomly drawn subset of individuals receiving the information treatment will be invited to a national deliberative event, where they will debate gas policy options and participate in question and answer sessions with experts. We will report treatment effects of information and deliberation on support for alternative uses of gas revenue, including saving versus spending, and direct distribution of resource rents.  We will also test a number of hypotheses about the process of deliberation itself, related to peer effects, leader effects, and polarization."
