abstract: "We investigate the perceived links between risk preferences within and across domains defined over probability (low/moderate) and outcome (prospect/hazard). In an experimental setting, we first elicit subjects' risk taking behaviors in different domains, and then measure their beliefs about links of behaviors within the same domain and across different domains. We test whether subjects overestimate within-domain links (i.e., underestimate noise), and document how they perceive the cross-domain links. We further examine whether subjects give sufficient decision weights to the corresponding within-domain links when they evaluate a cross-domain link. "
