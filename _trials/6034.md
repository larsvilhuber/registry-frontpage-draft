abstract: "In light of the current Covid-19 crisis, disinfecting one's hands before entering a store became a standard procedure in Switzerland, and stores commonly provide dispensers in the entrance area. So far, only little is known on how to effectively get customers to adopt this relatively new behavior as part of their shopping routine. 

In a field experiment, we examine how different written appeals affect the willingness of customers to disinfect their hands prior to / when entering a supermarket.
