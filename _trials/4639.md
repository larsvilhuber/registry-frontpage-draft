abstract: "Women’s educational attainment has increased substantially, but women’s labor supply in terms of labor force participation, wages, etc, has not experienced a commensurate increase in many developing countries. Such labor markets are often also characterized by imperfect information; in some cases coupled with social norms stigmatizing women’s work outside the home. This project studies the impact of information about workplace attributes on educated women’s job application behavior and occupational choice, and the role of family job search advice in these decisions through a randomized experiment in urban Pakistan.
