abstract: "This study is a long-term evaluation of the impact of microcredit in the Philippines. In partnership with two microcredit lenders, we introduced a credit scoring system that evaluates the credit worthiness of credit applicants. First-time borrowers who are marginally credit worthy are subject to a random credit decision where most receive an offer of credit but some are randomly rejected. By comparing those who were randomly approved for credit against those who were randomly denied, we will be able to measure the impact of access to microcredit.

This study is a follow-up to Karlan and Zinman (2010)."
