abstract: "Research finds evidence for race and gender biases in state-citizen interactions, public hiring and advancement, and citizens’ dealings with government and the public administration. What is the main determinant of these biases? On the one hand, statistical discrimination theory suggests that discrimination takes the form of stereotyping based on group membership that results from imperfect information. Discrimination results from a rational behavioral response to uncertainty (i.e., informational bias). On the other hand, taste-based discrimination theory suggests that discrimination results from some sort of animus towards members of an out‐group. Discrimination results from a cognitive bias.

The proposed study examines the relevance of statistical vs. taste-based models of discrimination in the context of citizens’ choice of service provider. Using a survey experiment design, we present 2,000 Danish citizens to three vignettes, each describing a scenario in which the respondents are asked to choose between two potential service providers. In each vignette, we manipulate the race/gender of the two service providers. Moreover, we manipulate provision of information suggesting that the two potential service providers are equally and highly competent and trustworthy (thus minimizing informational bias)."
