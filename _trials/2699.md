abstract: "We document a field experiment on the impact of a social information program on energy consumption and digital engagement, conducted with about 450,000 customers of a large Italian electric utility. The program consists in the delivery of a bi-monthly Home Energy Report (eHER), via email, presenting a comparison of one's own previous month consumption with that of similar efficient homes nearby. A random sample is assigned to a control group, receiving nothing. 
The main focus of the present project is the question of a possible mechanism behind the effect of the program. Environmental values are strong predictors of environmental behavior, because people who strongly endorse pro- environmental values are more likely to engage in various pro-environmental behaviors. While values tend to be stable in everyone’s life, environmental values are correlated with environmental self-identity, which, on the contrary, can be primed (van der Werff 2013). Therefore, we designed a treatment message aimed at priming environmental self-identity. The treatment message is included in the November/December eHER. Comparison of outcomes for customers exposed to the environmental self-identity priming relative to control subjects, will reveal the role of environmental values on the program impact."
