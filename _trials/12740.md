abstract: "An important hurdle to achieving gender equality is the restriction on female mobility. Female access to
healthcare, education, political participation, recreation, and employment, continues to demonstrate uneven
progress, despite significant progress in recent decades. One important factor in this is female mobility, that is
often restricted by norms, culture, crime, and (importantly) perceptions of safety. One solution recently
implemented in Pakistan, is the Women Safety App, specifically designed by a government agency to address
female safety concerns and in turn, facilitate female mobility. In this project, we evaluate the impact of access to
the App, on female mobility, as well as risk perceptions and beliefs."
