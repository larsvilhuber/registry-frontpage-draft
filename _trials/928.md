abstract: "South Africa has moved from a situation of water stress to one of water scarcity due to pressures from population growth, climate change, over-consumption and urbanization.  We study the effectiveness of non-price instruments at promoting water conservation in the residential sector in Cape Town, South Africa's second largest city. Using inserts in monthly costumer bills we test nine treatments in a randomized control trial on XXXX households. The treatments used can be classified in four broad groups: financial framing (focusing on the financial losses/gains involved in water usage), social comparison framing (where household consumption is related to that of its neighbors), public goods (focussing on water savings as a common or public good) and social recognition (rewarding households who save water by making their names public).
