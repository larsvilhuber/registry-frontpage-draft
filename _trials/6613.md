abstract: "The persistence of inequality across generations is a major concern worldwide. A de-fining characteristic of children from disadvantaged backgrounds is that they lack the family support that other children receive. Therefore, policies aimed at helping disadvantaged children face dire limitations as neither schools nor family-targeted programs can fully substitute or change parents. Existing evidence suggests that interventions have the best hope to succeed if they aim to compensate for lacking family support already in early childhood. However, little attention has been given to later interventions that provide personal support from other adults. This is the approach followed by numerous mentoring programs. 

We study a nationwide German mentoring program that offers adolescents from disadvantaged families a university-student mentor. The aim of the one-to-one mentoring relationships is to support the disadvantaged adolescents in developing their individual potential, personal skills, and school situation in order to achieve a successful transition into professional life. The program is organized as a social franchise with a centralized concept and support structure that is implemented in more than 40 self-governing locations. The core of the program consists of regular mentor-mentee meetings focused on career orientation, school assistance, and leisure activities.

To evaluate the impact of the program on adolescents’ labor-market prospects, we conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Since adolescents have not yet entered the labor market when we resurvey them one year after program start, we measure pro-gram effectiveness using three variables that are predictive of adolescents’ long-term labor-market success: math grades as a cognitive component, patience and social skills as a behavioral component, and labor-market orientation as a volitional component. We assess these outcomes separately and combined to an overall index of labor-market prospects. We also plan to collect data after adolescents’ entry in the labor market to assess their actual labor-market outcomes. Our analysis separates between adolescents from highly disadvantaged backgrounds (low socioeconomic status (low-SES)) who are the main target group of the program and (relatively) higher-SES adolescents who are also eligible to participate in the program."
