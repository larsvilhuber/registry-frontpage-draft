abstract: "While a number of studies have demonstrated a strong link between better formal management and organizational practices and productivity growth, many SMEs find investing in these areas challenging. They face a confusing and fragmented business support offer, and evidence suggests that many small businesses do not take advantage of formal advice. Research in the UK estimates that around 28% of SMEs have an unmet need for business support, and that half of these do not recognise this need despite experiencing unresolved problems.

The CIPDâ€™s People Skills program was designed to provide SMEs in the UK with human resource (HR) support and advice by connecting SMEs with local independent consultants. A pilot evaluation of the program showed that this could be an effective way of improving the HR skills of SMEs. This trial builds upon the pilot by focusing on how to connect SMEs to HR consulting efficiently and at scale in Birmingham, UK. In the first part of the trial, we randomly assign business members of the Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce to receive different communications containing behavioral messages and test their effect on take-up of free HR consulting. In the second part, we evaluate the effect of the free HR consulting on intermediate and long-term outcomes linked to productivity by randomly assigning the HR consulting service across SMEs that sign up for the program.
