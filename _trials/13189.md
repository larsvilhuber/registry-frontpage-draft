abstract: "Entrepreneurs are often depicted as boundedly rational and myopic decision-makers who rely on local search and readily available data (Moore, Oesch, and Zietsma, 2007; Simon, 1957). When searching and attempting to define or assess market opportunities, entrepreneurs are guided by their pre-existing experiences. Their knowledge sets coming from individual experiences, backgrounds, values, and beliefs, or domains, define what is salient when framing strategic and entrepreneurial problems (Camuffo, Gambardella, and Pignataro, 2023).

While there is a growing body of literature arguing that theory framing is essential in strategic and entrepreneurial decision making (Felin and Zenger, 2017), little is known about the relationship between entrepreneurial domains, theory framing, and entrepreneurial idea (and solution) generation.

The goal of this project is to understand whether making entrepreneurs aware of the impact exerted by their domains on their entrepreneurial ideas triggers a change in experimentation and search, beyond initial domains. 

Since exploration beyond what is known can expand the opportunity set at the expense of increased uncertainty and monetary and non-monetary (i.e., time, effort) costs, it is unclear whether exploration beyond initial domains can be beneficial or not. Given this trade-off, we argue that entrepreneurs who engage in “scientific entrepreneurship” (Zellweger and Zenger, 2023), adopting a theory-based experimentation approach, explore in a more structured way and are able to reduce the burden of expanded search (Camuffo, Cordova, Gambardella, and Spina, 2020).

To this aim, we investigate the impact that domain awareness (which shall trigger increased exploration) has in addition to scientific or theory-based experimentation (which shall reduce the cost of exploration). A companion study finds that domain awareness and theory-based experimentation have a complementary effect on the number of ideas generated by entrepreneurs (Frosi, Chondrakis, Gagliardi, and Mariani, 2024), but it remains agnostic as to what mechanism underlies this increase in idea generation. This study adopts a similar design, and administers a similar manipulation, but aims to uncover how the domains intervention, conditional on the scientific (or theory-based) intervention, impacts theory framing and decision-making. Moreover, this study aims to uncover the mechanisms underlying the main effects of receiving the domains intervention and the scientific (or theory-based) intervention (i.e., more ideas), attempting to understand what drives the increased number of ideas found in the field experiment with entrepreneurs. Lastly, this study aims to replicate the results of the companion study (Frosi, Chondrakis, Gagliardi, and Mariani, 2024) that finds that domain awareness and theory-based experimentation have a complementary effect on the number of ideas generated by entrepreneurs. 

This project designs and implements a laboratory experiment following up on a field experiment with early-stage entrepreneurs carried out at ESADE University in Spain (previously pre-registered on AEA under the code AEARCTR-0009325). 

In this laboratory experiment, we leverage on a sample of 140 entrepreneurship MSc students (enrolled in the entrepreneurship MSc program at Bocconi University) who have been trained on the theory-based approach to decision-making (the “scientific” or “theory” intervention), and we expose them to a second intervention, the “domains” intervention. In subsequent waves, we plan to involve more students from different courses (up to ~150 more students).

Participants to the study, who have already received the theory intervention, are randomly allocated to two groups for the domains intervention (treated, untreated). We adopt stratified randomization, using the two student cohorts that we leverage on as strata. This way, we ensure that each cohort has a similar split of treated and untreated participants.

The domains intervention, which is at the core of this pre-analysis plan, makes participants aware of their domains (the set of knowledge they derive from their past experiences and background) and of the impact that domains exert on the framing of their entrepreneurial theories.

The experiment is based on a business simulation where participants will be provided with a problem identified by an early-stage start-up, and will be asked to frame a “theory of value” (Agarwal et al., 2023) that maps the identified problem to an entrepreneurial solution. Following the first theory framing attempt, treated and untreated participants are shown different videos: 

1)	Treated participants will receive an 8.10-minutes training video emphasizing the existence of domain-defining factors, their impact on theory formulation, and the advantages and disadvantages derived from exploring beyond them. Moreover, they will be asked to reflect on their own individual domains and how these may be influencing the theory framing that they are coming up with for the business simulation; the “treatment video” will also talk about scaling a business, and focusing on how start-ups move from theory formulation to execution.

2)	Non-treated participants will receive an 8.10-minutes training (placebo) video talking about scaling a business, and focusing on how start-ups move from theory formulation to execution.

After the video, we will collect a number of self-reported and objective measures of performance, and we will compare them across different experimental cells to investigate the interaction between the domains and the theory-based interventions on exploration, theory formulation, and entrepreneurial solution generation."
