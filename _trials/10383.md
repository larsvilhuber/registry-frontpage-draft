abstract: "School-based educational technology (EdTech) has the potential to enhance student learning. However, there is limited evidence on how low-cost EdTech can promote learning in economically marginalized settings with inadequate internet penetration, growing digital divide, and varying teacher competencies. Collaborating with the Government of Bangladesh (GoB), we conduct an at-scale randomized field experiment to evaluate the impact of mobilizing under-utilized in-school ICT infrastructure to facilitate digital learning through two channels: providing better ``access'' to video-assisted learning (VAL) resources and ``mandating'' EdTech-based lessons. 466 nationwide secondary schools with existing functional digital classrooms  were randomly assigned to three groups: 1) packaged intervention consisting of offline educational videos and teacher training (Access treatment), 2) Access treatment plus GoB mandating weekly EdTech-based lessons in English and Mathematics (Mandate treatment), and status-quo (control). We aim to examine the effectiveness of providing access to VAL resources and mandating EdTech-based lessons on digital class utilization and student learning."
