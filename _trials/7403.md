abstract: "The garment manufacturing industry in many low-income countries is characterized by low wages and high turnover. Workers in these settings are typically limited in their ability to voice their concerns and grievances related to their jobs. Albert Hirschman’s seminal work – Exit, Voice, and Loyalty (1970) – posits that voice and exit are intimately related. We partner with a large garment firm in India to examine whether a technology-based worker voice tool can reduce exit and improve worker wellbeing. The worker voice tool we study here allows for two-way anonymous communication between workers and management. We also examine whether the effectiveness of this worker voice tool depends on the incentives faced by the HR teams assigned to deal with worker grievances. "
