abstract: "Climate change poses significant risks to coastal livelihoods. Increasing high tides and catastrophic storms challenge flood and water management infrastructure. Many residents and visitors to coastal areas are concerned about the threats of flooding and pollution but do not have the means or training to contribute to solutions. Citizen science describes the collection of data by the general public in collaboration with scientists.  Involving the public in projects can provide an avenue where both parties benefit. The scientists receive data that otherwise would be extremely costly to collect, and the citizen scientists are able to act on their concern for their local environment.
 
The Coastal Observer App encourages citizens to become active in monitoring weather and water locally and will help a team of University of Delaware and Delaware Environmental Institute researchers shape policy and environmental response. However, volunteers have a high opportunity costs of time (the loss of potential benefit from doing an alternative) and economic theory only explains a small portion of volunteer behavior. Economic studies have indicated that many volunteer only when requested to do so. 
 
This experiment builds understanding of citizen scientistsâ€™ adoption behavior for and persistent use of data collection practices. Specifically, we will study the decisions of citizen scientists in Delaware to adopt and use the SpotterOn Coastal Observer App designed to assist scientists. This research will also use encouragement design to explore how engagement with scientists might lead to continued use of the app. By addressing various aspects of citizen science and volunteering, this project will generate policy relevant insights on how to effectively promote adoption and persistent use of citizen science tools.

This research will use encouragement design to address if behavioral nudges, such as inviting citizen scientists to engage in the scientific and policy development process, encourage persistent use of the Coastal Observer app.
