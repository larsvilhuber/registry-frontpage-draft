abstract: "The agriculture sector is a significant contributor to Indonesia's GDP and provides employment for over 38 million people, but it also causes environmental issues. Promoting sustainable farming practices among farmers is crucial for environmental conservation, but their adoption has been slow. While previous studies have identified barriers, they may not fully explain the complexity of farmers' decision-making processes. This study aims to explore the effect of social norms and framing on Indonesian farmers' stated intentions to adopt sustainable farming practices, with the goal of developing a non-monetary approach to agri-environmental policy. The study will use a randomized controlled trial to investigate the impact of providing social information and framing on farmers' willingness to adopt sustainable practices, such as the use of organic fertilizers and avoiding pesticides. The experiment will be conducted through an in-survey experiment involving 1,104 farmers in Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The findings of the study can help to promote the adoption of sustainable practices, reduce reliance on costly incentives and subsidies, and benefit both farmers and the environment.
