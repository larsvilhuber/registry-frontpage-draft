abstract: "Our natural field experiment tests the effects of moral suasion messages on residential electricity use in Doha, Qatar. We use two types of treatment messages leveraging religious and national identity. Our experimental sample consists of 6,096 residential customers. We analyse effects on monthly electricity use using a difference-in-differences estimation strategy. Further, we test for heterogeneities in treatment effects using machine learning models. We show evidence for customers who respond more to the treatment being more likely to believe that their actions to conserve energy are both easy and effective. We rule out other differences driving heterogeneities in responses, including customers' nationality, residence type, pre-intervention use or knowledge about energy use."
