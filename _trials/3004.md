abstract: "This project intends to measure the impact of improved communication and behaviorally informed nudges designed to increase the take-up of a public program (Red Primeros Meses, RPM) that provides conditional cash transfers and professional support to pregnant women and parents of small children (up to one year old) in the City of Buenos Aires (Argentina). The RPM is a subprogram of the oldest conditional cash transfer program in Argentina, Ciudadanía Porteña (CP), and is aimed at increasing healthcare utilization and ultimately health outcomes of mothers and their babies. To identify the impact on the program’s take-up, we experimentally created two treatments and a control group. Both treatment groups received two Whatsapp messages per week and the control group was left untreated. The messages contained basic information on the requirements needed to become a beneficiary of RPM. Moreover, for each treatment we added additional information on: economic benefits of RPM (Treatment group 1) and non-economic benefits of RPM: access to professional support to help in raising healthy kids (Treatment group 2). The results of this study will contribute to the evidence on the effectiveness of the use of low-cost (mobile-based) behavioral nudges to increase the current low levels of take-up of many social public programs targeting vulnerable population, which is a common and puzzling feature both in developed and developing countries."
