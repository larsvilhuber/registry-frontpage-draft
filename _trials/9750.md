abstract: "Online, collaborative giving days, such as Giving Tuesday, are becoming an important part of the philanthropic landscape in the United States. Giving Tuesday has grown quickly since its inception in 2012, with the 2019 drive raising over $511 million from online gifts alone (Haynes and Stiffman 2019). Collaborative giving days like Giving Tuesday are typically time-limited and often involve a list of approved charities. While the decision making format of Giving Tuesday is arguably akin to other types of federated giving programs, such as workplace giving campaigns, it is notably distinct from typical year-end solicitations, which are usually considered one at a time. Research has not explored how donor decision making regarding lists of charities differs from their decision making regarding a series of single-organization solicitations. This study gathers evidence from a survey experiment on simultaneous (list) vs. sequential (one-by-one) solicitation decision making. The goal of the survey experiment is to reveal how the amount donors give and the organizations they choose differ in this charitable giving context. In addition, the project will collect evidence on the decision making theories which may explain differences between simultaneous and sequential solicitations, including choice overload, differences in mental accounting by donors, and induced comparison and diversification of giving."
