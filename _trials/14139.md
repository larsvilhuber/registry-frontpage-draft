abstract: "In partnership with the fact-checker Africa Check, we assess whether social media influencers (SMIs) can be effectively recruited to increase awareness of, and knowledge about, misinformation among their social media audiences. Our partnering fact-checker recruited ``micro'' SMIs---individuals, such as journalists and social activists, with significant followings---on Twitter in Kenya and South Africa. We then provided a random half of the SMIs with digital literacy training videos, as well as contemporaneous fact-checks, for them to share with their audiences through social media. We additionally cross-randomized the dissemination of identical content to their audiences via regular Twitter ads to compare whether SMIs are more effective than ads in ensuring that digital literacy training and fact checks reach and are internalized by their followers. This at-scale intervention ultimately seeks to understand how fact-checking institutions can effectively combat misinformation."
