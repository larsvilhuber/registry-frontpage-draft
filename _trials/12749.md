Thirty blind patients who expressed an interest in participation in the study were recruited from government a specialized school for the blind, 15 visually impaired individuals, and 30 individuals with normal vision from Foundation University School of Science and Technology, totaling 60 participants.  between November 2023 and January 2024.  They then undergo a standardized psychological assessment and were scheduled to undergo Cognitive test that are specially design for the blind. All participants met preserved general cognitive function (mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score of >24/30), and do not meet the diagnosis of dementia (according to the 10th International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related) Health Problems (ICD-10).Other inclusion criteria were as follows: males and females with an average age of 30 years (range:18 to 60).In order to be included in the study, the participants had to be diagnosis of visual impairment and blind as evaluated by an eye specialist, primary school education (â‰¥5 years), a Dementia scale and Beck depression Inventory.

All participants were fully informed regarding the study protocol and provided written informed consent. This study aims to investigate the impact of digit span and rest on the cognitive abilities of individuals who are blind or visually impaired, utilizing cognitive tests as an assessment of intellectual functioning. The intervention's efficacy in potentially ameliorating levels of dementia, depression, and cognitive impairment is explored through a rigorous research methodology. The findings seek to establish  psychometric property of Blind cognitive Intelligence test and   study the effect of cognitive functioning and the onset of dementias and depression in blind individuals, offering valuable insights into the intervention's effectiveness in enhancing overall cognitive function."
