abstract: "We present causal evidence regarding the impact of a student's ethnicity and gender on teacher evaluations in middle school. In this study, we engage teachers to assess written assignments for full classes in two subjects: mathematics and Norwegian language. By randomly assigning names that signal both gender and ethnicity to the assignments within teachers, we investigate whether students with equal ability but different names receive equal grades, on average. While our primary focus is on the average effects of student gender and ethnicity, we also conduct an extensive analysis of heterogeneity, considering factors such as ability, student gender, teacher experience, and the gender of the teacher. This document outlines our analysis plan, including our primary specifications of interest."
