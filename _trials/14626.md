abstract: "This experiment aims to test whether reminding customers of “happy moments” (HM) with a product (a positive experience) and varying the timing of the reminder and ask to refer (call to action or CTA) affects the likelihood that a customer refers the product. The customers are randomly assigned to one of 5 main conditions: (1) No communication, (2) Communication 1 day after HM + CTA to refer with reminder of HM; (3)  Communication 1 day after HM + CTA to refer with NO reminder of HM; (4) Users have a HM - Communication 1 week after HM + CTA to refer with reminder of HM; and (5) Users have a HM - Communication 1 week after HM + CTA to refer with NO reminder of HM. 
A credit card company implements the field experiment, and provides us the data thereafter.
