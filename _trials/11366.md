abstract: "Previous literature and public opinion polling have indicated that a sizeable proportion of the American public misunderstands the graduated nature of the U.S. federal income tax. How these (mis)understandings affect perceptions and preferences of the federal income tax system are less well understood. I start by investigating the predictors of graduated tax rate understanding. Then, after randomly assigning a sample of U.S. respondents to an informational video highlighting the key workings of the federal income taxâ€™s graduated tax rate structure, I estimate the effects of providing this information on an array of tax-related perceptions and preferences. Finally, I add an additional level of randomization which provides a common political claim about tax brackets to half of the respondents. I then estimate the effect of receiving accurate, political claims, and a combination of this information on attitudes towards the introduction of a new tax bracket that would affect only the highest of income earners.
