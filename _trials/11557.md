abstract: "The survey complements the experimental evidence documented in the paper "Does ESG Investing Help Venture Capital Funds Attract Startups? Experimental Evidence". It aims to answer the following questions:
a. Why do startup founders perceive venture capital funds that aim for positive environmental impact (i.e., "Environmental VC Funds") are less likely to help them generate profits?
Hypothesis 1: Environmental Mandates are very costly.
Hypothesis 2: Investors working in environmental VC funds are less capable of helping startups to generate profits due to expertise or network.
b. Why do startup founders have different evaluations of "Environmental VC Funds" and "Social VC Funds" ("Social VC Funds" refer to VC funds that aim for positive social impact)
Hypothesis 1: Social Mandates are less costly compared to environmental mandates.
Hypothesis 2: Investors working in social VC funds are more capable of helping startups generate profits than investors working in environmental VC funds.
c. Are there heterogeneous effects based on startup founders' demographic information?"
