abstract: "This study aims to determine if and how effectively the Latvian population can be encouraged to sort biodegradable waste (BIO). To achieve this, a combined vignette and "willingness to pay" experimental methodology is employed. In a hypothetical scenario, each respondent is presented with various levels of economic benefit for sorting BIO waste, while randomly providing them with different contextual information about waste sorting beforehand. The study helps to understand the economic and social motivations of residents to engage in sustainable environmental management practices."
