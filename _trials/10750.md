abstract: "The goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of encouraging use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools for learning and education in online learning platforms using an RCT that assigns participants in an online course into two conditions; the treatment encourages them to use AI tools (such as chatGPT) for posting in discussion prompts while the control does not.
