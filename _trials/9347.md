abstract: "We aim to test two conditions related to ongoing debates in exploitation theory by surveying academic philosophers. First, whether subjects place a greater emphasis on substantive or procedural notions of fairness in the context of economic transactions. Second, whether subjects view exploitation as a purely distributive phenomenon, or whether they think exploitation requires something more than mere maldistribution between transactors. Although these conditions have been the focus of ongoing theoretical debate, they have never been tested empirically. The results of the experiments will have relevance for redistributive public policy, institutional design, and workersâ€™ rights initiatives."
