abstract: "This experiment is part of a yearly survey conducted in Medellin asking its citizens questions about the governance, legitimacy, and taxation of three main actors: gangs, the municipal government, and the police. As part of the survey, we are interested in knowing how often and how much gangs extort (tax) households and businesses. We are unsure whether subjects would be willing to report extortion to the authorities. In addition to collecting self-reported willingness and actual responses to a WhatsApp inquiry, we conduct survey experiments where individuals are randomly assigned to one of the three treatment groups that might increase likelihood pf reporting: a video that increases the salience of the issue to the government (and their likelihood of acting on the information); a video that articulates the size and social cost of the problem; and a control group."
