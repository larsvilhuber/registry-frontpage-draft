abstract: "Approximately one billion people lack electricity access today, and three billion face the need to use a nonnative language on a daily basis; we study how these two constraints affect learning in public schools. We ask: how does school electrification affect education? How does variation in digital learning content, in particular the language of instruction, affect demand for education and performance? How can we measure the value of these school resources? We pilot-test these questions via tracking the results of a unique experiment conducted with 200 middle schools in northern Tanzania--educating 40,000 students each year--that are in the process of receiving, in a randomized, staggered roll-out fashion, solar-powered lights, TVs and language-varied educational videos over the years 2015 to 2017. We value private welfare changes by examining how students trade off attendance during class hours and remedial hours against their opportunity costs of time. We are additionally interested in complementing this analysis by using natural predictors of grid placement to identify the impact of energy expansion over the past decade on school performance (as well as on other measures of economic productivity as they relate to growth)."
