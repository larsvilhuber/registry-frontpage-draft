abstract: "This study investigates the impacts of smoking on workplace productivity loss depending on the employeesâ€™ smoking status. Factors examined in the current study are employee absenteeism, smoking breaks, and concentration at work among which have been analyzed in the literature as to contributing variables to the labor productivity of smokers.
A randomized controlled trial is conducted to test the following hypotheses: H1) there will be a difference in measured real effort provision on average between half of the smoker group with smoking breaks allowed and the other half without it, H2) there will be differences in measured real effort provision on average between smokers and non-smokers.
Overall, 90 participants are recruited from up to 30 employers, allowing a group size of 3 or multiples of 3 per company if possible. Two current smokers not participating in a smoking cessation program are randomly assigned to one of two treatments for the measurement of real effort provision. Socio-demographic data are also collected and controlled for analysis. "
