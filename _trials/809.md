abstract: "This document describes the analysis plan for a randomized experiment examining whether people who receive a poverty prime are more likely to imitate others in risky choices and inter-temporal choices. We will recruit 1012 respondents from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Half of the sample will receive a prime which triggers financial worries (poverty prime), while the other half will not (placebo). Then, half of the participants who received the poverty prime and half of those who received the placebo will get some information about how previous MTurk participants answered the questions on risk preferences and time discounting, while the other participants will not receive any information about previous participants' behavior. In our experiment we can therefore identify (i) how the poverty prime affects risk preferences and time discounting, (ii) how information about others' behavior affects the respondents' behavior and (iii) whether the poverty prime makes people more likely to imitate others in risky choices and inter-temporal choices. This plan outlines the design of the experiment, the outcomes of interest, the econometric approach and the dimensions of heterogeneity we intend to explore.
