abstract: "How do people update their beliefs on contentious political issues when they receive new information? Do they do so in a rational manner or do they refuse to update their beliefs? To investigate this, we perform a survey experiment through survey panel company Prolific.  We study the extent to which people claim their beliefs on highly salient political issues would change depending on pertinent empirical information (provided as hypotheticals). We then compare these responses to how beliefs actually change when people are given empirical information, which yields insight about the prevalence of motivated reasoning.  We apply this approach to a range of issues -- police shootings of minorities, climate change, affirmative action, income taxation of the top 1%, economic mobility, transgender participation in sports, crime in Republican- and Democratic-run cities, gun control, and the Olympics.  Within the same framework, we explore whether it is possible to de-bias individuals from engaging in motivated reasoning by asking individuals about how their beliefs would change as a function of varying hypotheticals."
