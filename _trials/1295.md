abstract: "In this impact evaluation, we are partnering with the Bangladesh Agricultural Value Chains Project to test interventions within specific value chains for impacts on outcomes among smallholders.  The goal of the interventions being studied is to move the value chain from an equilibrium in which farmers both face uncertainty about input quality and crop marketing methods to an equilibrium in which high quality inputs are available and used by smallholders, and they are better able to receive high prices for their output as it is of less variable quality.  For the jute value chain, the impact evaluation centers around cluster randomizing both training and promotional events for high quality, certified, and branded fertilizer.  The promotional events included a raffle for discounts for fertilizer; main outcomes to be studied include whether or not treated households participated in the trainings or promotional events; use of improved inputs; attitudes about improved inputs and trust in input retailers or input brands; specific crop production and yields; and agricultural revenue and profits."
