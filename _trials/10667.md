abstract: "Contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) systems have the potential to benefit both organizations and consumers. A prerequisite for AI systems to materialize their potential is the acceptance and, eventually, usage of these systems by consumers. However, the deployment of AI systems is associated with various challenges, too often leading to resistance and aversion to the algorithms. For instance, consumers oftentimes question the reliability and accuracy of AI systems and, thus, feel misunderstood by them. Literature shows that organizations may take action to reduce algorithm aversion. One possible means presented by prior studies is to allow users to modify AI models and their outcomes. In our work, we investigate how organizations may encounter algorithm aversion by involving users into the prediction-making process. More precisely, we propose an approach where organizations allow users to select which information they pass to the AI system - a process we call decentralized feature selection. In an experimental setting, we investigate the impact of this decentralized feature selection on consumers’ attitudes towards and the actual predictive performance of AI systems. "
