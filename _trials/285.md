abstract: "This project studies the socioeconomic impact of providing dental care services - mainly removable prostheses - to economically vulnerable individuals with a bad dental condition. These dental services are generally not provided by the Chilean public health system, and the private system is hardly affordable for them. Thus, we expect our intervention to palliate an important and neglected health need that, according to previous studies, may have a multidimentional impact in peopleÂ´s lives. 
Outcomes that we expect to influence are, for example, those related with perception of oral health, self- esteem and labour market participation.   "
