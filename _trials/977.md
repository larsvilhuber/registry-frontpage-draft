abstract: "Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is home to over 600 million people without access to electricity. Small-scale solar photovoltaic (pico-PV) products have emerged as a way to provide access to basic energy services, particularly modern lighting, and are assumed to be associated with development benefits such as household savings, increased productivity, better education, and reduced indoor air pollution. In Senegal, Lighting Africa in combination with Total, will implement a behavior change campaign relying mainly on radio clip broadcasting as well as community outreach print materials.
The proposed impact evaluation will assess two elements of the mass media campaign, comparing narrative clips broadcasted at a national radio station with the same radio intervention in combination with community outreach materials regarding per capita costs and effects on awareness, understanding, and demand of solar lights. It is based on an innovative experimental design that achieves village-level randomization without needing to control radio airwaves. Moreover, this is the first experimental mass media study related to energy and climate-change. If the mass media campaigns (the primary focus of this impact evaluation) increase purchases, the evaluation team will aim to measure the behavior change and development impacts of these products."
