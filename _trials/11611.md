abstract: "This randomized control experiment addresses underreporting of domestic violence in Madagascar. We formed a partnership with a microfinance NGO to produce an educational video that addressed different types of violence and appropriate response measures. Over a five-month period, the video will be randomly broadcast across seven agency locations. Anticipating the participation of 4,000 individuals, we will use questionnaires administered by social workers to collect data on knowledge of, attitudes towards, and reported cases of domestic violence. Throughout the study, we gathered information on beneficiary characteristics and conducted both quantitative and qualitative surveys to assess the video's reception and impact. The objective is to measure video effectiveness in raising awareness and assessing changes in knowledge, reporting, attitudes, and psychological well-being. We will use the collected data to evaluate the intervention's impact and inform future efforts to prevent and address domestic violence in Madagascar."
