abstract: "We want to study how transparency and access to information regarding firms' polluting activities shapes subsequent polluting behaviour by these firms in Montevideo, Uruguay. Specifically, we want to test whether transparency regarding compliance with environmental regulations in waste product processing can improve the ecological footprint of these firms. In association with the effluent inspectors unit of the Montevideo municipal government, we create Ykarai, an observatory of firm compliance which uses an easily interpretable coulour-coded system to report the track record of manufacturing firms in terms of liquid pollutants. Using this observatory, we progressively disseminate data on firms' behaviour for up to 129 firms. We introduce firms in three randomly selected batches in four month periods until all firms are included. We use this staggered inclusion process to study how firms react to publication of information on compliance. Our outcomes include reported pollution, measured pollution and communications with the monitoring body. "
