abstract: "We designed and conducted a series of experiments in partnership with a large pharmaceutical company operating over 150 plasma donation centers, with the aim of promoting sustainable behaviors in the workplace.  Our study employed social norms to nudge employees towards reducing electricity and plastic consumption and increasing recycling. We randomly assigned participating centers to four groups of three treatment arms, with one pure control group. Each center was involved in one experiment only. The interventions involved five key elements, including intervention, tier board tracking, education, signage, and communication. For reducing electricity consumption, we focused on how long freezer doors remained open. To reduce plastic waste, we focused on dropped collection materials that must be discarded once they are dropped. Lastly, for recycling, we focused on uncollapsed cardboard waste and plastic contamination in recycling dumpsters. Through these interventions, we can measure the effectiveness of nudging and promoting sustainable behaviors in the workplace. Our study design can serve as a model for future research in similar contexts, shedding light on successful approaches to promoting sustainable practices in the workplace.  As such, our work will contribute to filling the gap in the current literature."
