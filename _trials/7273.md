abstract: "Project Connect is a comprehensive home visitation intervention that targets child welfare-involved, substance-affected families with children and adolescents ages 0 to 17 through home-based services and treatment. Project Connect addresses the complex needs of substance-affected families by providing intensive, long-term services aimed at strengthening families by addressing issues of unhealthy parental substance use and helping parents recover while keeping children safe.  The program focuses on maintaining children safely in their homes (preventing admission to care) or facilitating reunification when children have been placed in out-of-home care.

The goal of the evaluation is to determine whether Project Connect increased reunification for families receiving Project Connect services and document how the program is implemented in Rhode Island. This evaluation has two main components, an implementation study and an impact study. The impact study examines the effect that the program had on outcomes, using quantitative data collection and analysis. The impact study will employ a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The evaluation will randomly assign families to be referred either to receive Project Connect services or to receive services as usual. The study will follow all randomized families in the evaluation for one year after the completion of treatment. The implementation study examines how the program is executed, the policies and practices of the state child welfare agency and the context of substance use in the state of Rhode Island."
