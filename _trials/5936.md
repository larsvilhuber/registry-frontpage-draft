abstract: "Increasing evidence shows that soft skills play a key role in labor market outcomes, but there is no consensus on how to foster these skills. Several interventions are implemented through workshops and training, at relatively high cost. Eskreis-Winkler et al. (2019) show that advice-giving can trigger a process of introspection, which can improve study habits and improve test scores. 

We explore the role of introspection, which allows participants to process information they have already acquired, on the formation of soft skills. To do so, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial in a debate competition in Peru, where prior to the contest half of the participants were asked to write down advice to participants in future versions of the contest. These participants were reminded of their own advice four days before the contest. We examine treatment effects on the participants scores in the debate competition, as well as on satisfaction with the event and with their own performance. To unveil the mechanisms behind these effects we analyze treatment effects on preparation time and type of preparation activities performed."
