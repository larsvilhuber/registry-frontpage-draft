abstract: "This study consists of three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) designed to improve our understanding of the interaction between a health crisis and political behavior in authoritarian countries. All three are conducted as part of a nationally representative telephone survey of about 1600 adult residents of Russia in April 2020, early in the COVID-19 outbreak. The first RCT investigates three mechanisms through which the coronavirus pandemic might be impacting support for Russia’s president and other leaders. The second RCT investigates how Russian President Putin’s public responses to the pandemic is shaping ordinary people’s behaviors that are widely believed able to influence the spread of the virus. The third RCT considers whether the same leader’s endorsement of health-promoting behavior can increase the likelihood of such behavior."
