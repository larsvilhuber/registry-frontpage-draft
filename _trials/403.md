abstract: "The project analyzes the role of information dissemination regarding new technologies and more efficient agricultural practices, and the potential bottlenecks extension services might face in their role of bridging the distance between the research institutions and the local farmers. We consider an ICRAF program targeting dairy producers in Uganda. The farmer trainer (FT) program focuses on dissemination of a set of practices to improve animal feeds and use them more efficiently. EADD trains volunteer farmer trainers, who in turn train other farmers in the production and use of the high-value animal feeds and feeding practices. 
This study is aimed at estimating the overall impact of EADD farmer Trainer approach, as well as analyzing the impact of different variations of the Farmer to Farmer (FTF) extension approach.  Three program variations are considered (the details may be changed as the study unfolds): First, in order to account for beneficiary heterogeneity a variation on customization of extension advice will be conducted. Here it is proposed that selected FTs will be trained to conduct needs assessment with their trainees and help them build individual action plans, focusing their effort on technologies / practices that are more appropriate to them. The second experimental variation, aimed at improving the quality of the information, will establish linkages of FTs with extension professionals who can provide tutoring and expert advice to FTs and monitor their activities. Finally, the third variation will focus on increasing FT incentives. Here a tournament will be organized by which the local community whose milk production increases most will be rewarded by a significant gift and/or social recognition.
