abstract: "Theory predicts that exponential-growth (EG) bias, the tendency to neglect compounding interest, and present-biased preferences, the tendency for people to underweight future consumption, will both lead to suboptimal saving decisions.  However, there is a lack of empirical research on the incidence and interaction of these biases in predicting saving behavior. This study seeks to fill this gap in the following ways. First, we will measure the joint distribution of exponential-growth bias and present bias using a representative sample of the U.S. population, and correlate these measures with a variety of demographic characteristics and economic outcomes. Second, we will test a set of interventions designed to counteract present bias and EG bias on hypothetical saving decisions.  We will give particular attention to the heterogeneity in treatment effects with respect to individuals' EG bias and present bias.  Finally, by assuming more structure we can conduct a counterfactual analysis, estimating retirement savings if all bias were eliminated.  These results will provide evidence on whether people make biased decisions regarding their retirement savings, the mechanism of the bias, and how best to design policy to improve decisions."
