abstract: "We examine the effects of providing real-time guidance by the tax authority to taxpayers as they file their tax returns on taxpayers' filing behavior. The study will be based on data from a field experiment by the Norwegian Tax Administration (NTA), using their new and digitized tax filing system. For a set of filing items, qualified taxpayers are randomly allocated into a treatment group receiving specific guidance notes, relevant for their tax affairs. The control group will not receive these notes although the information is equally relevant to them. By comparing the filing behavior of the two groups, we investigate whether real-time guidance is an effective means of communication by the tax authority to taxpayers that leads to higher compliance."
