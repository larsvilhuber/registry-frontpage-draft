abstract: "The gender wage gap is a global issue that impacts women of every country, race, and age. One potential factor explaining the gender wage gap is a difference between how men and women approach and conduct negotiation over their wages. To determine the influence of gender differences in wage negotiation, we create an online laboratory experiment to induce behavior consistent with real world wage negotiation settings. "
