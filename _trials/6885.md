abstract: "The goal of this study is to determine how information campaigns that explain different benefits of widespread vaccination against COVID-19 affect vaccine uptake. We will conduct a survey experiment where participants will be exposed to 1 of 9 different information treatments including: a no information, control treatment, information explaining the economic benefits of taking the COVID-19 vaccine, the public health benefits of widespread vaccination against COVID-19, the private health benefits of vaccinating against COVID-19, and combinations of private health benefit, public health benefit, and economic benefit messages, and the vaccine trial process.
