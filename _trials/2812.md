abstract: "Lack of market access has been highlighted as a crucial constraint to technology adoption and productivity growth in Africa, but rigorous empirical research on the topic is missing. The objective here is to experimentally examine whether farmersâ€™ productivity and willingness to adopt modern technologies will significantly increase if they become meaningfully integrated into the value chain and thus are able to access both functioning input and output markets. Additional constraints, such as lack of knowledge about best agricultural practice, in a scenario in which farmers have access to effective input and output markets, will also be addressed. Because the project aims to experimentally change the market structure farmers face, it requires implementation on a large scale. To achieve this, the intervention is designed in collaboration with a social entrepreneur, active in the maize trading sector in Uganda.
