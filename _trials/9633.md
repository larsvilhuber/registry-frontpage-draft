abstract: "Despite the importance of domestic work globally as a source of employment opportunities for women, particularly women from low-income backgrounds, limited research has been done in the economics literature to assess or evaluate interventions in this sector. Our study proposes to evaluate the impacts of two types of interventions for female domestic workers in Bangladesh: 1) technical and life skills training and 2) access to digital work platforms that make it easier for female domestic workers to access new work opportunities. We plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess the impacts of training and exposure to opportunities on digital labor platforms on the wellbeing of female domestic workers in Bangladesh. The study will help us understand the extent to which providing skills, including life and employability skills, and easing information frictions in the markets for informal labor can improve outcomes for female domestic workers in Bangladesh, a setting where an estimated 80 percent of the 1.3 million domestic workers are female.
