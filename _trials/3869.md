abstract: "The proposed study aims to evaluate the impact of the project on vocational education, psychosocial support, soft skills training, and labor market placement for vulnerable youth (including displaced youth) in the districts of Bosa and the municipality of Soacha in Colombia. The project is implemented by the Swiss NGO Vivamos Mejor and its local partner Fundación Apoyar.
In low and medium income countries, poor households tend to have a "portfolio of work" rather than a "job" (Blattman and Ralston, 2015). In these context, increasing incomes is not about creating jobs but improving skillsets to raise the quality of work portfolios (Blattman and Ralston, 2015). There is some evidence on the effectiveness of vocational training programs – programs that develop technical skills with the aim of integrating trainees in decent working conditions in the long term (Beerli et al., 2017) – in reducing youth unemployment in Latin America, but the results are not conclusive (Attanasio et al. 2011, 2017; Angrist et al., 2002, 2006; Card et al., 2011). It is perhaps not only hard skills, but also soft, "life" skills, which are lacking, and some initial evidence suggests that complementing vocational education with additional treatments is indeed more effective in obtaining results (see e.g. Bandiera et al., 2018). As far as we know, there are no studies that directly measure the impact of complementing vocational education with "life skills" training. Our study can clarify if, and to what extent, programs with complementary treatments are more effective than programs with only vocational education.
The proposed randomized control trial is composed of 300 vulnerable young adults who will be randomly sorted via lottery into three groups: a control group, a treatment group receiving vocational education (Treatment 1), and a treatment group receiving vocational education, psychosocial support and citizen empowerment training - our life skills training component (Treatment 2). Each group will be composed of 100 young adults. 
We expect to find that participants with vocational education and soft skills training are better able to find a job in the formal labor market, making at least the minimum salary (which is more than they would have made in the informal labor market), and receiving social and health security benefits.
