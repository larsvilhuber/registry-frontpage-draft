abstract: "We generalise the ﬁndings of the experimental literature investigating conditional behaviours to the setting of tax compliance. In particular, we investigate conditional behavioural responses to tax malpractice in a survey experiment on a representative sample of the Italian population and examine whether cheating rates in a die rolling task diﬀer according to whether the respondent receives information about high or low estimates of the share of unreported income in Italy. Our design allows us to investigate whether asymmetries arise in the incidence of cheating according to whether the estimates of unreported income are higher or lower among the top compared to the bottom income earners."
