abstract: "In collaboration with a large charitable organization, we conduct a large-scale field experiment designed to investigate the role of group identity for individual donation decisions in a natural setting. In particular, we test the hypothesis that perceived group membership in combination with group competition have the potential to increase charitable giving. The intervention takes place in July 2021. In addition to the main research question, the project aims at shedding light on (I) whether it needs explicit incentives for salient group membership to have a positive
effect on individual donation decisions, (II) whether public recognition as a group-level incentive can increase charitable giving, and (III) whether potential effects of group identity on charitable giving can be further exploited by a supplementary peer-to-peer fundraising method. After approximately twelve months, we measure long-term effects of our treatment manipulation."
