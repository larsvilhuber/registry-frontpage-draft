abstract: "We conduct a field experiment with US households to study how expectations about long-run
home price growth shape spending decisions. In our survey, we exogenously vary these
expectations by providing households with different expert forecasts. Linking the survey
data with rich home-scanner data, we document that homeownersâ€™ spending is inelastic to
home price expectations. By contrast, renters reduce their spending when expecting higher
home price growth. These findings reflect differences in the tendency to be a future net
buyer of housing across the two groups. Our study highlight consequences of asset price
growth for consumption inequality."
