abstract: "Several studies have examined the uses and impact of generative AI applications aimed at improving the productivity of people in the workplace and other settings. However, little is known about the contexts in which people may be more or less willing to seek and adopt AI feedback. This study is aimed at determining how perceptions about AI affects its usage by people. We randomly vary the way in which an AI feature is introduced to users via text-based “nudges,” and then measure how users respond in terms of their willingness to try out the feature.  "
