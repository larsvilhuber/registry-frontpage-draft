abstract: "The aim of this project is to understand the factors that influence the regular use of a Bank account among poor and emarginated women. This is important because it would foster financial inclusion, which would then be able to further promote gender equality in the context of a household. We wish to investigate the role of two main factors: information versus peer pressures. The outcome of this research will also have strong policy implications with a wide applicability to several settings in developing and developed countries. Indeed, if peer pressure is the critical factor (relative to pure information), then group mobilization (as a policy lever) is necessary to trigger a collective decision to adopt formal financial tools and to further promote gender equality."
