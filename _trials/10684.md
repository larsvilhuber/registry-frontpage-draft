abstract: "We study the effects of NPower Canada's sectoral employment program, which offers skills training to under- or unemployed individuals from low-income communities, aiming to employ them in the information technology (IT) industry. We propose an analysis of the effectiveness of the program through a randomized control trial (RCT) looking at several outcomes, such as employment, continuing education, earnings, job quality, and others. We will combine surveys with government administrative data. Additionally, we intend to perform a cost-benefit analysis and develop a theoretical job search model. To evaluate the results of the RCT, we use a straightforward econometric framework that accounts for multiple hypothesis testing and allows for heterogeneity by participant characteristics or program stream.
