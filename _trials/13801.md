abstract: "This study explores the in-person wage premium among tutors, hypothesizing that tutors charge higher rates for in-person services compared to online services. Utilizing a correspondence audit study, the research targets tutors advertising on an online platform. Close to 5,000 tutors advertise their services through this platform. Many tutors offer both in-person and online lessons. In this correspondence audit study, tutors will receive emails from fictitious parents inquiring about the price and availability of tutoring lessons for their child. The targeted population comprises professional tutors who teach languages or secondary education subjects (mathematics, physics, chemistry, or biology).  Key outcomes include callback rates and quoted hourly rates. The study employs a randomized design with robust controls for potential confounders, such as education level and experience. Data collection involves web scraping, and results will be analyzed to assess the impact of service type on tutor responses and rates, providing insights into market dynamics and pricing strategies."
