abstract: "Citizensâ€™ willingness to cooperate with the state is a fundamental determinant of state capacity.  This willingness to cooperate is particularly important in the context of pandemics: reducing the spread of a virus requires citizens to follow state directives and engage in behavioral change (e.g. social distancing, reporting symptoms, etc.).  In many developing countries, however, states have limited capacity to even temporarily change the behavior of citizens.  In this project, we investigate whether sharing information designed to increase trust in the state can improve citizen compliance with state directives on minimizing the spread of COVID-19.  We test this in major urban centers in Punjab, Pakistan through three information treatments that emphasize one of the following: past state effectiveness in addressing a public health emergency, the importance of citizen cooperation in addressing a past public health emergency, and religious authorities' support for state directives.  We will track citizen intentions, beliefs, perceived norms, and self-reported behaviors over time to understand how citizen trust in government and state institutions can foster cooperation with the state.
