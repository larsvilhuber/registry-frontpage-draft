abstract: "Our field partner Open Research Funders Group (ORFG) is interested in encouraging Open Science Practices (OSPs) among traditionally underrepresented academic institutions. ORFGâ€™s key hypothesis is providing a small amount of funding to such institutions for targeted interventions can kickstart a broader movement towards open science practices. ORFG is in conversation with several funders to support such interventions which could form a part of a large field experiment testing the value of such funding. Here we propose to evaluate a smaller pilot ORFG is running with one funder to disburse about $100k to traditionally underrepresented institutions for OSP interventions."
