abstract: "In the midst of a growing economic and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, more than 4 million Venezuelans have fled their country. More than 30% of these Venezuelan refugees have fled specifically to Colombia, which has welcomed them with friendly policies. Due to the worsening nature of the Venezuelan crisis, the number of refugees in Colombia is expected to continue growing at a worrisome pace, and the private sector has been encouraged to get involved. However, not much is known about Colombian consumers' perceptions of this potential involvement of the private sector. This project will attempt to measure Colombian consumer willingness to pay for corporate social efforts supporting Venezuelan refugees in Colombia. We will do this through an online survey, advertised through Facebook ads. Moreover, the study also explores the effect of salience regarding the Venezuelan refugee crisis in general, by using a sentence-descrambling exercise as a priming mechanism. "
