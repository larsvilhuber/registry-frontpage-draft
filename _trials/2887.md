abstract: "International studies indicate that social-emotional skills are good predictors of academic performance and also of professional and personal outcomes in adulthood. In addition, some studies show that such skills can be stimulated by socio-emotional learning initiatives, in which specific topics are added to traditional school curriculum. Despite those evidences, socio-emotional learning programs are incipient in Brazil and in the rest of Latin America. Therefore, through a random experiment with baseline and follow-up of a two year implementation of a social-emotional learning program (Compasso Program), this work aims to collect data that will allow us to push socioemotional skills' formation agenda forward in Brazil. We also aim to contribute with direct recommendations for Brazilian public policies. Compasso Program is a Brazilian version of a United States Program called Second Step. Both programs add socio-emotional lessons in the traditional school curriculum."
