abstract: "The process of refugees achieving labor market integration is a crucial step in their path towards self-sufficiency and assimilation within the local community. Nonetheless, this integration can encounter significant challenges, particularly in countries such as Malaysia, which have not ratified the 1951 Refugee Convention. In Malaysia, refugees and asylum seekers lack legal rights to formal employment. The official stance of the Malaysian Government categorizes UNHCR registered refugees and asylum seekers as 'illegal' or 'undocumented migrants'. Such an environment can fuel resentment, mistrust, and discrimination between refugees and the host population, especially when it may incorrectly portray refugees as competitors for employment and economic resources. This context may also lead refugees to compete with each other and hold differentiated attitudes even among refugee groups.
Our study aims to assess the impact of perceptions of labor market competition on out-group attitudes. To do this, we employ a randomized questionnaire module, which presents survey respondents with narratives about a fictitious individual. This individual can either belong to the in-group or different out-groups, and we randomly highlight differences or commonalities in labor market characteristics between the respondent and the fictitious individual.
