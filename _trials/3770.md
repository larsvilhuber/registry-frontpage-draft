abstract: "In August 2018. the Hungarian government has terminated the only gender university program in the country and actively generated a sentiment against gender studies. Google Trend (https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=HU&q=%2Fm%2F09hcb) shows nicely that when the government announced the closure of the gender program, there was a surge in the interest in gender in Hungary. We want to see if this backlash against gender-topics translates into a negative reaction against conducting academic research that mentions that gender is a topic of the research.
We plan to carry out a field experiment in a sample of Hungarian secondary schools on how economic preferences (time, risk, social and competitive preferences) affect school performance. A substantial gender difference in some of these preferences (most notably risk and competitive preferences) have been found in the literature, so gender is a natural part of our investigation. We would use this feature when sending out letters to secondary education providers asking them about their willingness to facilitate research in their schools. We will randomly send out three sorts of letters: one treatment and two control groups. One-third of the letters would mention that - among others - we are interested in gender differences (using explicitly the word gender that seems to arouse those negative sentiments). In one of the controls we would substitute gender with social-status, while in the other third we would not include this half-sentence.
