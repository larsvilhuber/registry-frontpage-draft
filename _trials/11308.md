abstract: "Rapid advancement in agricultural machinery and automation technology is transforming traditional agriculture. In developing countries with a large proportion of smallholders like China, intelligent equipment such as drones and self-driving machines have been increasingly applied in agriculture, facilitating precision farming and enhancing agricultural productivity. However, the adoption of these new technologies has been relatively slow, possibly due to information-related factors. Firstly, farmers may have limited access to information on intelligent farming equipment. Secondly, they may lack supply information on agricultural machinery. Given the high costs of machinery investments, smallholders are more likely to use machinery services than to purchase equipment themselves. Therefore, the availability and information on local machinery services are essential for farmers’ technology adoption as well.
We propose a field experiment to investigate whether providing farmers with information on two representative types of intelligent farming equipment and their corresponding local farming services can lead to changes in farmers' perceptions and adoption rates of these technologies. The follow-up survey consists of two steps: firstly, we will assess the impact of the intervention on farmers' perceptions and willingness to pay for the technologies; secondly, we will evaluate the effect of the intervention on farmers’ actual adoption rate of the technologies and their long-term impact on agricultural production."
