abstract: "In this experiment, we will experimentally examine the impact of increased competition in the recruitment market on employers' hiring and wage decisions. We design a laboratory experiment where we will use reserve wage to stimulate the hoteling model (Hotelling, 1929) to introduce competition in the hiring market. We will compare 2X2 treatments to identify whether increased competition in hiring market can effectively undermine the ethnic discrimination in both hiring and wage decisions: Hiring competition X flexible wage scheme. In the treatments with hiring competition settings, employers will face hiring competition in the labour market while in the treatments with a flexible wage scheme, employers can choose different wages to increase the likelihood of hiring their preferred candidates. The experiment is designed to test two theories: (1) whether discrimination can help employers to segment the market and escape away from competition; (2) whether ban of wage discrimination will lead to greater hiring discrimination.
