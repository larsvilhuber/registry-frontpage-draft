abstract: "This study employs a priming experiment to assess whether civilizational identity significantly shapes attitudes toward important questions of foreign relations in Russia. Apart from a control group, randomly selected subsets of individuals in the study are primed to have in mind the category of civilizations generally, the idea that Russia belongs to European civilization specifically, the idea that Russia does not belong to European civilization, and a statement by Russian leader Vladimir Putin that Russia is part of European civilization. The study then assesses whether these different primes are associated with different responses to questions that elicit attitudes on Muslim migration, the Ukraine conflict, US-Russia relations, and Russian economic development prospects relative to the rest of the world. The differences will yield estimates of the extent to which civilizational identity influences attitudes on foreign relations. The study will also explore whether effects vary by whether people think Russia is part of European civilization, by education, by age, by ethnicity, and by geographic place."
