abstract: "This study presents a randomized controlled trial that tests an asset-based micro-equity livestock financing model in northern Bangladesh. The approach uses a profit-sharing mechanism to purchase and fatten cows, distributing risks and rewards between the financier and smallholder farmers. Another treatment arm offers a standard loan with a fixed repayment structure. We randomly assign 105 villages into control, profit-sharing, and loan-based groups, along with a within-household randomization of whether the offer is made to the husband or wife. The baseline covers 1,517 households, followed by phone midline and in-person endline surveys to track livestock ownership, time allocation, household consumption, borrowing, and women’s empowerment. We propose to employ an ANCOVA framework with strata fixed effects, estimating the Intent-to-Treat Effects, and adjust for multiple comparisons across outcome families. By comparing profit-sharing to the standard loan product, this trial aims to determine whether risk-sharing contracts can enhance household well-being and women’s decision-making relative to traditional debt-based financing.
