abstract: "New maize varieties are released regularly in the Kenyan market, giving farmers a wide range of options.  Yet, despite the potential genetic gains from new varieties, farmers prefer older varieties that have been in the market for a long time. Providing in-store promotions when farmers make seed purchases may draw farmersâ€™ attention to newer varieties and induce trial and experimentation with these varieties. The current study tests the role of stimulating demand for newer varieties."
