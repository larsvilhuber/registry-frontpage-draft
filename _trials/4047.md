abstract: "Data shows that public good provision in India decreases with an increase in caste based fractionalization. While past research documents this association, the causal interpretation and the deeper mechanisms driving the result is an open question. This project aims to plug this gap by identifying the precise causal connection between caste fractionalization in India and under provisioning of public goods using an artefactual field experiment. Further, it aims to examine if higher fractionalization leads to lower co-consumption of public good due to distaste for the social other. To give an example, suppose people from different castes need to coordinate to build a well or lobby with local authorities to build that well. In a more caste wise fractured village, people may be less likely to coordinate and build the well because they have a distaste for sharing the public good with outgroup members. This form of associative distaste is markedly different from free riding, the dominant theme examined in the context of public good provision. Participants from Upper Castes and Scheduled Castes play a public good game under three treatment and two compositional conditions. In Treatment 1 they play it with money, while in Treatment 2 and 3 they play the game with biriyani (a delightful self contained meal consumed in many parts of India). In Treatment 2 participants can carry the food back home while in Treatment 3 they co-consume the food at the venue. Each treatment is played with only Upper Caste, only Scheduled Caste and mixed participants. Our experimental design allows us to separate free riding and unwillingness to share owing to associative distaste as two plausible reasons behind underprovision of public goods, through lab-in-the-field experiments conducted in rural areas in the Indian state of Bihar."
