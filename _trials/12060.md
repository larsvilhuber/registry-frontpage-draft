abstract: "Foundation Literacy and numeracy (FLN) is critical for a child's education. Indiaâ€™s National Education Policy (NEP) recommends a set of basic literacy and numeracy skills to be acquired by Grade 3. These requirements are not met in many districts in India for various reasons. Here, in a field experiment, we plan to test interventions targeted at improving teacher uptake of effective FLN instructions. As part of the interventions, bite-sized videos on effective teaching practices will be shared with the teachers, or summaries of daily lesson plans from the teacher guides will be made accessible through a WhatsApp Chatbot.
