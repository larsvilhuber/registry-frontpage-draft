abstract: "We partner with one of Indonesia’s largest banks to test how increased transparency and competition in the market for branchless banking influence fees charged to clients and the volume of transactions they do. Our experiment includes four treatment arms: (i) the bank’s branchless banking agents receive information about the expected changes in competition in their area; (ii) banking agents are given an incentivized choice to enroll in a marketing plan that discloses the bank’s official prices or an alternative plan that does not require them to disclose official prices to their customers (at a higher cost); (iii) agents are presented with the choice between the two marketing plans in (ii), but before making the choice, they are informed about the expected changes in competition in their area (as in (i)); and (iv) clients of the bank’s branchless banking agents are directly informed about the official prices for the most common transactions. The experimental design will allow us to estimate the causal effect of (i) changes in competition; (ii) the implementation of full price transparency, and (iii) agents’ willingness to be transparent upon changes in the competition environment.
