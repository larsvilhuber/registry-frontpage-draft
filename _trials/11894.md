abstract: "This study aims to examine if recipients of free educational support become more inclined to engage in volunteer activities and the impact of volunteering on well-being. We focus on secondary school students in rural Bangladesh who have received free educational audio lessons in a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). We will measure their propensity to volunteer and elicit their preferences for volunteer activities. We also introduce a new RCT which randomly assigns volunteering invitation among the subset of students who sign up for volunteer activities. We use this new RCT to disentangle the effects of receiving IVR free educational support from the effects of participation in volunteer activities on studentsâ€™ well-being."
