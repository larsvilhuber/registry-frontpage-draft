abstract: "The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a minimum of eight antenatal care (ANC) contacts, initiating ANC during first trimester, giving birth in facilities, and postnatal care (PNC) within 24 hours of birth to reduce maternal and perinatal mortality. These recommendations specifically refer to ANC “contacts” instead of “visits” to place the emphasis on continuous interactions between providers and pregnant women that does not necessarily imply a physical visit to health facility. In Ghana, although attendance of at least one ANC visit is nearly universal, attendance of the recommended number of visits remains below target, women typically start ANC late in pregnancy, and many still do not deliver in a health facility. Though it is the woman who bears the pregnancy, in Ghana and many other patriarchal societies, decisions to seek health services are often made by other stakeholders. For instance, it is often the mother-in-law who makes decisions about the merits of ANC and the husband who makes the financial decision. Many programs ignore this reality. We propose to test an intervention that focuses not only on encouraging pregnant women but also their support networks about the importance of seeking modern maternal care, taking into account deeply entrenched cultural beliefs.
