abstract: "Schools in refugee settings do not only provide children with opportunities to learn and play, but also represent a safe environment to recover from trauma and to re-built a sense of normality routine that allow children and adolescents to find purpose and motivation. However, schools are also a place where children are likely to experience violence; this may be even more likely in emergency settings. In Nyarugusu refugee camp in Tanzania reports of violence in schools perpetrated by teachers and peers are common, however official estimates do not exist. The present study will employ a double list experiment to produce unbiased estimates of teacher's use of phyisical violence against students in primary and secondary schools in Nyarugusu refugee camp. The estimates from the list experiment will be compared to answers provided by teachers to direct questions about use of physical violence to assess the extent of of underreporting and therefore the extent ot social desirability bias. Further sub-group analyses will be conducted to assess whether use of physical violence and underreporting is higher among teachers with specific characteristics.
