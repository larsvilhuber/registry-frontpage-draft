abstract: "This pre-analysis plan documents the intended analysis for an experiment that follows up on AEARCTR-0009592. This follow-up randomized experiment examines how individuals perceive discrimination, further (relative to the original experiment) varying the methods used to hire workers and what workers know about them to understand certain mechanisms behind the original treatments that reduce perceptions of discrimination. The main outcome is the rate of perceived discrimination in each of 6 treatment arms (four of which replicate the original experiment). The follow-up will also replicate and extend the results of the original experiment on the effects of perceived discrimination on future labor supply, and, unlike the original experiment, will measure comprehension of the various treatments. This plan outlines the study design and hypotheses, outcomes of interest, and empirical specifications."
