abstract: "We propose to analyse the impact of a Community Driven Development program on social preferences, specifically on attitudes towards inequality and inequity and preferences for participatory decision-making. We exploit the implementation of a randomized control trial which offers to rural Bangladeshi communities the opportunity to build a public source of safe water and requires them to take collective decisions within a public consultation process over key features of the project. We designed an innovative lab-in-the-eld experiment in order to elicit preferences toward redistribution and participation. Players participate to face-to-face group discussions to decide how to allocate a common endowment among themselves, with and without the requirement of contributing to its creation. In a subsequent stage of the experiment, we measure individual willingness to pay for participatory decision-making. Our findings will inform on the impact of CDD programs on social norms and preferences in receiving communities, a crucial feature to account for when assessing the long term impact of participatory development."
