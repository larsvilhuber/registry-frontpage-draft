abstract: "In educational contexts where physical inputs are missing, it is natural to hypothesize that these are a binding constraint to improve learning outcomes. However, a body of literature has provided strong evidence that input provision by itself is not an effective driver of higher learning outcomes in developing countries. There is less evidence, however, about the efficacy of these policies when they are coupled with supports that also shape behavior and incentives around the learning process. Through the analysis of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Tecp√°n, Guatemala, I provide evidence on whether input-provision of high-quality, culturally-sensitive and curriculum-aligned textbooks coupled with teacher training on how to use the books properly can be an effective driver of learning outcomes, particularly of early literacy skills. This intervention addresses a major educational gap in this area of Guatemala, and contributes to the broader literature of policy effectiveness in the area of early literacy in developing countries. The paper discusses more broadly how Spanish literacy develops in contexts of initial low learning levels, and deprived educational environment. Given the small scale of the intervention, the paper discusses the constraints and needs to scale a program with the same features of this intervention."
