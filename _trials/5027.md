abstract: "This study uses a clustered RCT design to evaluate the consumption and income impact of distributing a bundle of cost-effective agricultural, health, and energy products to smallholder farmers in Tanzania. We also examine impacts on a variety of secondary outcomes, including utilization of the products within the bundle, the value of household assets, and minimum acceptable diet among young children. Outcomes are measured approximately one year after the distribution of the bundle to treatment households."
