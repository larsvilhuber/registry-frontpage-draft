abstract: "Search behavior in markets depends on how consumers perceive the gains from search and their knowledge about the distribution of potential outcomes. To examine how search costs can be estimated accurately, we conduct an online search experiment in which we (a) measure objective search costs by offering piece rates for search in addition to price savings and (b) examine search behavior under varying price scales, price distributions, and searchers’ knowledge about price distributions. We estimate search costs using an empirical model that allows for biased perceptions of the gains from search. The results from the experiment allow us to study which aspects of the search environment influences search cost estimates and informs future empirical work on search markets."
