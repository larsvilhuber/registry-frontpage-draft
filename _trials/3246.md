abstract: "Using a randomized controlled experiment involving economists in nineteen countries, we estimate the effect of ideological bias on views among economists. Participants were asked to evaluate statements from prominent economists on a wide range of topics. However, source attribution for each statement was randomized without participantsâ€™ knowledge. For each statement, participants either received the actual source, an altered ideologically-different source, or no source. We then measure whether economists agree/disagree with identical statements to different degrees when statements are attributed to authors (researchers) with different views (ideologies) which put them at different distances to mainstream economics. Traditional norms of modern science, such as organized skepticism and disinterestedness, are intended to make the identity of the source of an argument/research irrelevant (Merton 1973). Therefore, any evidence showing that changing the identity of sources affects how economists evaluate arguments will cast doubt on the notion that economists are objective scientists and are not influenced by ideological biases."
