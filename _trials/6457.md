abstract: "We plan to study whether students how motivated beliefs about their academic ability and if so whether that motivated reasoning influences academic outcomes. To do so, we plan to elicit beliefs about relative rank on a midterm in introductory economics courses at a large public university. We then plan to administer a price-list questionnaire to assess how much students would be willing to pay to learn their actual rank, or if they would prefer to receive money to not learn their rank. We will then randomly assign students the true information about their rank depending on their questions to the price list question. We will then study how preferences for information about ability interacts with how students process information they receive as well as academic outcomes in the courses under study."
