abstract: "This study aims to examine whether a combination of positive and negative commitment devices is effective at inducing long-term smoking cessation in smokers from a low-to-moderate income background. Investigators will randomly assign patients of a multi-site clinic in Connecticut to receive one or both of a succession of two commitment contracts. First, a two-month reward contract will pay participants for (a) engaging in clinic and web-based activities that support smoking cessation and (b) quitting smoking, as measured at period end. Second, a four-month deposit contract will invite participants to commit funds which they forfeit unless they abstain from smoking over the entire period. A random subset of participants will also have the option to pre-commit to the deposit contract at study enrollment. Reward payout and deposit recovery will be conditional on biochemical verification of self-reported abstinence. Investigators will conduct follow-up biochemical verification at 12 months to observe whether abstinence persists after removal of incentives. The primary outcome of interest will be continuous abstinence from smoking between months 2 and 12, i.e. biochemically verified abstinence at all three measurements. A short baseline and endline survey will also be administered to measure characteristics and outcomes related to smoking behavior."
