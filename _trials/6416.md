abstract: "An increasing body of studies investigates if moral reminders can prevent dishonesty. It has been shown that their effectiveness varies with their content and that they are sent before rather than after actions are taken. However, most studies focus on one-shot decision making. Little is known about the effectiveness of moral reminders across time. Reminding individuals about being honest early on, e.g., when a contract is started, may be ineffective if individuals forget about the reminder. If individuals make multiple decisions, it may be more effective to remind them after they have gathered experience with the task and possibly even gave in to the temptation to cheat. The effectiveness of moral reminders might also increase if it is signaled that observing behavior across multiple instances allows assessing if someone was dishonest. The goal of our study is to investigate how moral reminders send at different times and with different content affect dishonesty. The study will be implemented as an online experiment, participants will be recruited using Amazon Mturk. "
