abstract: "Successful inclusive growth policies in low and middle-income countries require effective performance by local governments. Arguably, an important reason for poor state performance is that citizens have limited information about state performance and are therefore unable to hold local governments to account. Correspondingly, we expect that citizens with greater information about state performance are more likely to demand accountability from the state. Using a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) that creates exogenous variation in incentivized beliefs about the performance of the state for 2100 respondents in Jharkhand, India, we test whether providing information to citizens about the service performance of their district leads to them changing their beliefs about state performance, participation with the government and satisfaction with public service delivery. Our study contributes new findings to research about on political accountability, the drivers of economic development, inequality, and governance."
