abstract: "We study the impact of changing the existing terminology used to describe features of the rules governing Social Security retirement benefits on retirement claiming decisions and knowledge. We provide respondents from a nationally-representative online panel with information pertinent to the decision of when to claim Social Security retirement benefits; the content is identical for all respondents, but some are randomly given an alternative set of terms to refer to the key claiming ages (the experimental treatment group) while others are given the current terms (the control group). We then elicit claiming intentions and knowledge."
