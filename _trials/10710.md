abstract: "We provided random subsets of respondents with different pieces of information about the inflation target of the European Central Bank and the underlying decisions about its new monetary policy strategy, announced in July 2021. Another random subset (the control group) did not receive any information. This set-up allows us to identify the causal effects from communicating the strategy review decisions on the perceived credibility of the ECB’s target. "
