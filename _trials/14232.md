abstract: "To effectively address the prevalence of anaemia, it is crucial to encourage young girls, who are future role models, to undergo anaemia testing and adhere to prescribed iron and folic acid (IFA) dosages. This study uses a randomised order of phase-in to evaluate an intervention that aims to increase the Hemoglobin (Hb) test uptake while quantifying the intention-action gap regarding testing. Furthermore, we examine the effect of the training on reducing this intention-action gap. While previous research has demonstrated the immediate effects of various interventions on knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) measures, this study seeks to determine whether the training has a prolonged impact. Specifically, we assess differences in KAP measures after three months to thoroughly evaluate the program and identify any mechanisms contributing to changes in Hb test uptake. This analysis will help us understand the barriers to behaviour change. Additionally, we explore whether there is heterogeneity between college-attending girls and working women.
