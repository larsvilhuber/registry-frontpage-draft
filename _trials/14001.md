abstract: "We employ a novel experimental design to investigate gender biases in performance evaluations, specifically examining whether women receive less recognition for their successes and face harsher penalties for their mistakes compared to men. Utilizing advanced artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC), we manipulate the perceived gender of players, allowing participants to evaluate identical performances attributed to different genders. This methodology isolates and measures the causal effects of gender bias. Our study involves Prolific participants assessing tennis highlights and unforced errors, ensuring evaluations are based solely on performance while varying perceived gender. Grounded in Regulatory Focus Theory, we explore how promotion focus (associated with ambition and risk-taking, typically linked to men) and prevention focus (associated with caution and responsibility, typically linked to women) influence these evaluations. Study 1 examines if men are more generously rewarded for successes, represented by highlights, while Study 2 investigates if women are more severely penalized for failures, represented by unforced errors. We provide novel experimental evidence on the mechanisms of gender bias in performance assessments."
