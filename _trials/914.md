abstract: "Corruption, tax evasion and ineffective revenue collection mechanisms can hinder a countryâ€™s economic growth. Designing more efficient and transparent tax administration systems is thus an important policy challenge, particularly for low income countries. Tajikistan, one of the lowest ranking countries on Ease of Paying Taxes (178/189) and Ease of Doing Business (143/189), implemented a reform of its tax system in 2012 to allow tax payers file tax returns electronically (e-filing). E-filing can streamline tax payments by eliminating long submission waiting queues and by reducing corruption, with fewer direct interactions between taxpayers and tax officials. However, few years after this reform, e-filing take-up rate remained low. This study aims to provide empirical evidence on the factors affecting the adoption of a new technology like tax e-filing in a developing country, and the impact of this technology on tax compliance costs, tax behavior, and perceived corruption. Our sample includes 1,500 firms representative of all legal SMEs operating in the capital Dushanbe. These firms were randomly assigned to one of three groups that received different e-filing incentive packages: firms in group1 received information and training on how to register and use e-filing, firms in group 2 received these same services, plus personalized assistance with registration, and firms in group 3 received only a generalized tax training that was not specific to e-filing.
