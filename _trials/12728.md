abstract: "Smallholder producers throughout the developing world continue to produce old crop varieties, despite the availability of newer, likely preferable alternatives. One explanation is that learning about new varieties through experimentation is risky, as newer varieties can be more expensive, and farmers may be unsure of how these varieties will perform on their land. As self-consumption is also prevalent, households may face additional consumption-related risks when producing a new variety, such as dislike of the taste. In this project, we compare interventions that address production-side risks (free seed trial packs) and consumption-side risks (free samples of the same variety's end-product, and a cooking demonstration) to adoption of new varieties. We use a randomized controlled trial with a 2x2 matrix treatment design, where farmers either receive one intervention, both, or neither. We implement this across six settings (Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Nigeria, and two in Uganda) considering a variety of crops."
