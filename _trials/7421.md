abstract: "This pre-registry outlines pre-specified hypotheses for analyzing data collected from the study “Replication of Village Savings and Loans Groups in Africa.” The primary research question is to examine the factors that influence the quality and quantity of replication of Village Savings and Loans Associations (VSLA’s). We plan to test the implications of social and individual identity-based motivation training on replication quality and quantity  Differences between social motivation and the control group as well as the difference between the individual motivation and control group will be tested. By studying replication and examining treatments designed to increase replication, NGO’s can have more accurate estimations of their impact and reach as well as learn how to help motivate groups to replicate thereby expanding their global impact. Data collection is scheduled to take place in Mchinji and Kasungu, Malawi from July 2021-December 2022 and is expected to be expanded into Tanzania.
