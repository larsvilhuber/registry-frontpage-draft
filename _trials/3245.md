abstract: "Over 70% of Malawians living in rural areas are excluded from the formal financial sector. This situation has led to a drive in the governmentâ€™s efforts towards increasing financial inclusion through the expansion of digital payment systems, the leverage of Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLAs) to increase savings, the effective empowerment and education of consumers, amongst others. Several studies have shown that participation in VSLAs can improve business outcomes as well as financial inclusion. Recent evidence also points out to the potential of digital payments to increase money circulation, making capital available where most needed. We therefore hypothesize that the usage of digital payments in the form of mobile money in VSLAs will lead to more financial inclusion and better business outcomes. Our project thus, proposes to implement a cluster randomized control trial to test the effects of an intervention that promotes mobile money usage combining the diffusion of  information in the field and SMS usage reminders among participants of Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLAs) on financial inclusion and entrepreneurial outcomes. Primary outcome indicators in the experiment will be the use of mobile money for business purposes and savings. With the current Malawi Financial Sector Development Strategy running to 2020, we expect that the outcomes of this study will provide valuable evidence to inform this strategy and influence its further development.
