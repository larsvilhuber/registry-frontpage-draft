abstract: "The Learning from Administrative Data (LAD) initiative seeks to extend the evidence of the long-term effects of various welfare-to-work programs evaluated in the 1990s, programs that included components such as earnings supplements, child care subsidies, work requirements, time limits on benefit receipt, and education services.  Evaluations of these programs found that they typically increased mothers’ employment and earnings and childcare use.  Some increased incomes and others did not, as increases in earnings were offset by reduced benefits. Questions remain about the long-term effects of these programs on children.  Did they increase parents’ employment and/or family incomes enough to reduce poverty over the long-run or helped end the “cycle of poverty” by improving the outcomes of the children of welfare recipients?  

The project will take advantage of multiple randomized controlled trials conducted by MDRC in the 1990s, including over 55,000 participants (mostly welfare recipients).  It will merge data for the study participants with administrative data held by the U.S. Census’ Center for Administrative Records research and Applications (CARRA) to study the long run (over 20-year) effects of these policies on outcomes such as employment and earnings, fertility, marriage, and mortality, for adult participants and their children. This entry focuses on the analysis of the NEWWS evaluation, which tested the effects of 11 mandatory welfare-to-work programs that tested employment-focused versus education-focused approaches to increasing work and reducing benefit use.
