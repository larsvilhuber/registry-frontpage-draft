abstract: "With a framed-field experiment (FFE) with around 150 farmers in Italy, associates of the Confederazione Italiana Agricoltori (CIA), I focus on Socially Responsible production decisions. Producers often take decisions in teams (the administration board) and their decisions impact on multiple stakeholders; these features might impact on the Social Responsibility of producers. With a 2x2 design, I aim at separating two factors affecting Social Responsibility of groups: payoff commonality and joint decision-making. I vary the number of decision makers (individual decision or majority decision in a group of 3) and the number of subject's affected by the decision (determine own profit or 3 people profit). If people bear a cost when acting "unethically", acting in a group will allow subjects to share the responsibility for their action, diminishing the cost and increasing the number of "brown" (not socially responsible) actions. When acting in the interest of a group, having to care about stakeholdersâ€™ profits might write off the guilt from, and hence increase, "brown" behaviours. "
