abstract: "This research project aims to understand to what extent information about a financial product, when provided either to men or women, affects spousesâ€™ beliefs and attitudes towards the financial product, product purchase decisions, and intra-household information sharing, cooperation and conflict outcomes. We conduct a randomized controlled trial among 3100 pastoral households in Kenya and Ethiopia. We randomize, at the household-level, the gender of the spouse that receives information about an index insurance and savings financial product through video interventions. Additionally, we cross-randomize whether or not the household member that is targeted with information can directly share the information with their spouse, by requesting the intervention team to also show the video to their spouse. We collect survey data from both the male and female spouse."
