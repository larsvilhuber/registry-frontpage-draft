abstract: "This study seeks, first, to experimentally measure the effect of apprentice labor inputs on firm output. Second, the study seeks to understand the mechanisms behind and timing of any effect, using random variation in the match between apprentice and firm, and repeated data on training inputs, apprentice progress, and firm output during the training period."
