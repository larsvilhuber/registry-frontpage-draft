abstract: "Throughout the developing world, there are substantial gender differences in school attendance and the economic lives of children. Moreover, these differences generally widen as cohorts age as the gap between male and female enrollment increases. Female students are accordingly less likely than their male peers both to enter and to graduate from secondary school. This dropout risk is associated with vulnerability to child labor, forced labor, and human trafficking.

This evaluation seeks to answer the question of whether life skills training and mentoring by older female role models, denoted “social mobilizers”, can improve school progression and non-cognitive skills for girls while reducing their engagement in child labor. The project is being implemented by Williams College in partnership with the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab and the non-governmental organization Room to Read. The objective is to evaluate Room to Read’s Girls’ Education Program, and the sample includes 2,551 girls in 119 schools that are located in the Ajmer District of Rajasthan, India. To evaluate program impacts, girls in 60 of the 119 schools were randomly assigned to receive Room to Read’s Girls’ Education Program, while girls attending the remaining 59 schools were assigned to the control group."
