abstract: "This project takes a novel approach to study fairness views, beliefs about the income-generating process, and preferences for redistribution in three different countries: China, the USA, and Germany. Using survey data from representative samples, we will (i) compare individual fairness views and beliefs across countries, (ii) investigate whether there is a association between fairness views and beliefs, and (iii) study how fairness views and beliefs relate to preferences for redistribution.
