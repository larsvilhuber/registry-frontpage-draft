abstract: "Fitness trackers are associated with improved physical activity. However, little is known about how various types of goals nudged by fitness trackers affect consumers’ physical activity and health. The goal of this project is to measure the effect of different types of tracking goals on consumers’ workout participation, exercise effort, and health outcomes. To examine the effects of goal-based nudges, we propose a randomized field experiment at the campus recreation center at one of the largest U.S. public universities. Participants will receive a fitness tracker and will be assigned to various goals for their workouts. We will track their workout participation, exercise intensity, and health outcomes to understand how goals can enhance the usefulness of fitness trackers and improve health outcomes. "
