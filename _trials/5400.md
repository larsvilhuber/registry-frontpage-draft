abstract: "Public procurement of goods and services represents the primary area of government investment, accounting for a large share of the GDP in low-income countries. As a result, its potential as a driver of private sector development is massive. Yet, frictions in the functioning of procurement markets can lead to low competition,  potentially resulting in an inefficient allocation of resources. Our project aims to estimate various information-related interventions that have been conducted in collaboration with the Uganda Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Authority (PPDA), i.e. the national public procurement supervisory agency. Here, we test whether an intervention aiming to increase transparency of public procurement opportunities affects firm-level outcomes."
