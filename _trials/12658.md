abstract: "While research dissemination traditionally focuses on other academics, policymakers, and the public, social scientists increasingly recognize the obligation of sharing results with research participants. When research findings are shared, impacts are typically assessed qualitatively rather than quantitatively. In the context of a study on health- and diet-related beliefs and knowledge among parents and children in urban Vietnam, we aim to explore the relationship between the delivery of research findings to study participants and their health perceptions, diet perceptions, and research acceptance."
