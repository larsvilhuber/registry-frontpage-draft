abstract: "This project studies a land certification program in rural Côte d'Ivoire aimed at formalizing customary rights to land. Through a randomized policy experiment, we will examine the impacts of land certification access on landowners and land users. This pre-analysis describes the project's motivation and research questions, experimental design, and empirical strategies to be implemented in analysis."
