abstract: "Poor service delivery in the health sector in developing countries is well documented. Health worker effort is increasingly recognized as key to improving these outcomes. This cluster RCT studies the effect of surprise cash awards given to primary health clinics in Nigeria. A key element of the award is that health workers have discretion over how it is to be allocated and spent. The only condition is that the award can only go towards service delivery improvement. Earlier work has shown that giving even small unconditional gifts to health workers can strengthen intrinsic motivation. We hypothesize that the award will lead to greater output of effort by health workers in intervention clinics. In addition, we hypothesize that the award will ease budget constraints and lead to greater investment in complementary inputs. We study the effect of this intervention on service delivery and health outcomes. "
