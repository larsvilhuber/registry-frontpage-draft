abstract: "This study examines the impact of participating in a summer youth employment program. The program runs for approximately 6 weeks, during which time participating youth work 20 hours per week in a variety of community service related capacities. To determine the causal impact of the program, we randomly assigned eligible applicants the opportunity to participate in the program in summer 2018. We plan to follow the youth for several years, collecting data on a variety of outcomes via a survey as well as through administrative sources.    "
