abstract: "The role of women in Western societies has changed fundamentally in recent decades as women have increasingly become part of the workforce. While the male breadwinner model may continue to play an important role in certain contexts, it is unclear how much people’s expectations regarding women’s roles in the labor market have changed, to what extent people are actually aware of these changes, and what the driving forces behind changes in gender norms are. In this context, physical attractiveness could play a particular role, as attractive women might benefit from their looks in the marriage market or in the labor market where they might serve as role models for others and thereby accelerate societal change. 
In this paper, we experimentally investigate the extent to which society expects women to behave in line with traditional family-oriented norms and whether expectations differ depending on physical attractiveness. By distinguishing between personal beliefs and assessments of other people’s views, we identify social norms in the labor market and consider possible misperceptions in this context. As a methodological innovation in research on the role of beauty in the labor market, we use modified AI-generated images to determine whether particularly beautiful women serve as trailblazers of modern social norms or whether society expects them to comply even more with traditional gender role models. To learn more about possible mechanisms, we elicit people’s expectations regarding the income of a woman and of a male partner, depending on the woman’s attractiveness. Moreover, we analyze heterogeneity in regard of personal beliefs and misperceived social norms, as, for example, men and women may differ in their views on the role of physical attractiveness in female labor supply decisions."
