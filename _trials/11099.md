abstract: "Research shows that people with low socio-economic status (SES) in particular are less likely to participate in health studies. However, in order to be able to transfer the study results to the general population, it is important to reach a representative group of people. This is the only way that all strata of society can benefit from new medical findings as well as preventive and treatment options. Although studies to date have highlighted the problem of underrepresentation of people with low SES, little research has been done on possible solutions for reaching all social groups for health research. Other strands of literature show that people with low SES have lower levels of trust and present-biased preferences. 
The RCT is part of a transfer project in cooperation with the Universit√§tsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) and aims at identifying factors that motivate people with low SES to take part in health research. For this, we send out letters to former participants of the Hamburg City Health Study (HCHS) to invite them to come to the open-doors day and participate in a survey on motives for participating in health research. The former participants will be randomly assigned to 5 different groups receiving different letters with text modules designed to generate trust in health research or communicate the personal/societal benefits of health research. Our hypotheses are that lack in trust and present-biased preferences prevent low SES citizens from participation in health research. That is, we expect that generating trust and emphasizing the private benefits of more people participating in health research already today, will increase the participation of people with low SES in (a) the survey, (b) the open-doors day, and (c) a planned idea workshop (where participants can get more involved in the conception and implementation of health studies), while emphasizing future private benefits public benefits will not.
