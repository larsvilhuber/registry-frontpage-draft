abstract: "Introduction: Acute gastroenteritis is one of the important causes of mortality in infants and children and one of the six factors of death among children. 
Aim: The aim of this study was to compare the effect of Zinc Sulfate and Saccharomyces boulardii probiotic (Yomogi) on children over 2 years with acute gastroenteritis admitted to the pediatric clinic during 2011 to 2013.
Methods: In this clinical trial children were studied in two groups of case and control. The control group received standard treatment of diarrhea (fluid therapy, continuing feeding and Zinc Sulfate syrup 5 cc QID) and case group received Saccharomyces boulardii probiotic capsule with trade name of  Yomogi (250 mg daily) in addition to standard treatment. Demographic information, diarrhea status, appetite recovery and mean frequency of diarrhea before and during treatment period were recorded and then data were analyzed.
Results: There were 100 children in each group. Average age of children was 35.93±6.18 months in control group and 37.65±3.64 months in case group. Mean duration of symptoms and times of diarrhea after treatment in the two groups had a significant difference. Also the number of days until recovery, patient’s appetite and satisfaction between two groups had a significant difference. But Age and Gender  and the number of times of diarrhea before starting treatment did not have any significant difference and before treatment both groups were similar in terms of severity of disease.
Conclusion: According to this study, a combination of zinc sulfate and saccharomycesboulardii probiotic (yomogi) is recommended in children with acute gastroenteritis.
