abstract: "This study will compare three interventions aimed at improving teacher presence, teacher service performance, and student learning outcomes in remote areas of Indonesia with business as usual approach through a randomized controlled trial. All interventions involve facilitation to help communities and schools agree upon service standards, with quantifiable indicators for each teacher, which are subsequently monitored and scored on a monthly basis by community and parent representatives. Two extensions add monetary incentives for teachers who receive the remote area allowance. In the first, the allowance is cut based on the rate of teachers presence, and not paid if the rate falls below a set threshold. In the second, the allowance is cut based on the score on teacher service performance based on the service standards. The study is implemented in 270 schools in 2 districts in East Nusa Tenggara and 3 districts in West Kalimantan provinces of Indonesia."
