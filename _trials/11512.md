abstract: "This project studies social protection programs for the poor: we ask whether in-kind transfers are more effective at tackling household poverty than offering households with the equivalent valued transfer as an unconditional cash transfer (UCT)? 

We use an RCT to measure the causal impact on households of the offer of either in-kind asset transfer or unconditional cash transfer. We estimate the impacts of each form of transfer on a rich set of economic, social and psychological outcomes at the individual and household. We measure impacts both on the actual beneficiary households, and also measure whether there are positive or negative spillover effects of each form of social protection scheme to other households in the same community.
