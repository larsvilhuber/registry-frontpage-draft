abstract: "To suggest effective policies for female empowerment in India, it is critically important to understand a parent’s decision to invest in their daughter’s. We study this by randomly varying payment and information shocks to the parents of high school students, who we randomly incentivize to participate in a 2-week exposure to the labor force. 

We will test whether being selected for a short internship along with the act of randomly receiving cash empowers girls to voice their demands for education to their parents, and whether the cash can increase educational outcomes through parent’s beliefs on ability or some other behavioral mechanism. On the parent side, we attempt to disentangle two sources of bias on their daughter’s ability to earn income: (i) bias from beliefs on an individual daughter’s ability to earn income and (ii) bias from the belief that most daughters cannot earn income due to India’s historically low femalelabor force participation. On the student side, we measure changes in job-search behavior and beliefs for a period of one year following expected high school graduation.
