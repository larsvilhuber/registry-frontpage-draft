abstract: "This financial intervention provides small subsidies to cover the pecuniary costs of opening formal savings accounts to 1200 agricultural households in rural Ethiopia.  Our intervention focuses on assessing the role of saving product design i.e., single vs. joint deposit accounts, on a large set of individual and household outcomes. This study is an attempt to determine how access to single or joint saving products leads to differences in decision-making authority and control over resources that in turn lead to changes in labor and schooling outcomes, agricultural inputs and crop output, and which ultimately lead to changes in householdsâ€™ consumption, income, and subjective well-being.
