abstract: "We will evaluate the short-term knowledge impacts of a communication-related intervention using an RCT in Uttar Pradesh, India. The intervention redesigns existing methods of communications for the Soil Health Card Scheme, a nation-wide agricultural scheme designed to provide farmers with crop-specific fertiliser recommendations based on local soil testing. We assigned two variations of the intervention: redesigned cards with mobile-based messages and only redesigned cards. The study is designed to evaluate the impact of the intervention on a primary outcome: knowledge of a crop-specific fertiliser recommendation. Ancillary outcomes include: intention to adopt fertiliser-best practices and interaction with communication material."
