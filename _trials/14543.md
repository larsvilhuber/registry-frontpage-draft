abstract: "This study tests the impacts of early childhood programs on post-secondary trajectories, and whether interventions during high school help amplify their impacts. We randomly assign students who were previously part of a prior early childhood intervention (described in the attachment). We randomly assign these students, now high schoolers, to either a control group or a high school intervention that provides one-on-one mentoring and financial incentives for timely completion of college applications."
