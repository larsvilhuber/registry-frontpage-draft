abstract: "As personal cellphones proliferate and work-life demands rise, employees  and organizations face  growing challenges regarding how to manage work-life boundary control and support.  Research is needed comparing theoretically-developed work-life interventions  targeting manager behaviors and considering  overlooked workforces . In this paper, we present three studies that develop and test a  conceptual model integrating literatures on manager implementation of work-life policies, family supportive supervision, and boundary control. In Study 1 (n= 25), we used  qualitative methods to identify how managers and employees are using cell phones on and off the job for personal and organizational boundary control.  In study 2, we analyzed data across 69 work sites (n =473 managers and 740 employees) to develop and validate three scales based on issues identified in study 1. In Study 3, we conducted a randomized field experiment design to compare the effectiveness of two work-life interventions designed to change manager behaviors: implementing cellphone policies to increase boundary control;  and family supportive supervisor behavior (FSSB) training.  Our finding suggest positive main effects on managers respecting time off behaviors, and employeesâ€™ boundary control for interventions involving cell phone policy boundary control, but not FSSB.  Manager moderators of effectiveness included caregiving responsibilities, partner status, and cellphone job crafting.
