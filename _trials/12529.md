abstract: "We conducted an online study to capture US consumers' inflation expectation and its determinants.  We use Binarized Scoring Rule for a discrete distribution to measure priors and posteriors about future CPI inflation rate.  We also design treatments between the elicitation of priors and posteriors.  Our treatments entail combined news excerpts from news media outlets with positive and negative tones.  In some treatments we reveal CNN or FOX news logos as one of the news sources.  We expect political affiliation and news source's political inclinations to affect inflation expectations. 

H1: Republicans and Democrats will be more like to update their inflation beliefs when facing Fox and CNN logos in the news excerpts, respectively. 

H2: We also expect this update magnitude will be higher when individual political affiliation overlaps with the news source's political inclinations.

H3.  We expect inflation belief updates will also affect food consumption and financial planning.  We expect higher inflation will pronounce in more restrained and conservative spending.
