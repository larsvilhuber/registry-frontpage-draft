abstract: "In this paper we analyse the relationship between group size and the effect of diversity on workers’ performance.  We focus on diversity in skills, but also investigate the additional impact of diversity in gender on performance. First, we explore the link between diversity and group size theoretically in a model with knowledge spillovers in production, which predicts that the effect of diversity (in skills) on individual performance increases with group size. We test this hypothesis in a lab experiment in Guinea-Bissau. Nursing and Economics students solve an individual test twice, first in isolation and then communicating with other participants, in homogeneous and diverse groups of different sizes. Our main outcome variable is the change in the percentage of correct answers between the two tests taken by a given individual. We test whether this change is positive and largest when the respondent works in larger and diverse groups compared to smaller homogeneous - or diverse - groups. We additionally ask whether the effect of skills diversity on performance is affected when accompanied by gender diversity, and whether this interaction is different in small or large groups and for male or female respondents."
