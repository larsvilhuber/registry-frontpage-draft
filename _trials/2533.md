abstract: "This study evaluates the effectiveness of a new rapid rehousing program in Santa Clara County on single adults. The goal of the study is to determine whether an intervention of this type is effective at decreasing shelter entry, emergency room visits, and arrests and/or increasing earnings and stable housing. The key components of intervention include a short-term housing subsidy and individual case management. The program is being run by a community service provider in agreement with Santa Clara County's Office of Supportive Housing. We will use County administrative records to track outcomes for at least two years post random assignment. Demographic data obtained from HMIS records will be used to investigate how treatment effects vary across subgroups."
