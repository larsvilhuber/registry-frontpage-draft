abstract: "This survey experiment investigates the tax expectations and preferences of German businesses. It aims to assess corporate attitudes towards tax burdens, decision-making in uncertain tax scenarios, and time preferences regarding tax obligations. Through randomized questions on risk aversion, participants choose between guaranteed tax refunds and probabilistic options, illuminating their tolerance for uncertainty. Additional sections explore expected tax liabilities, time preferences for tax payments and refunds, and sensitivity to intertemporal choices under varying return scenarios. The survey provides valuable insights into how businesses anticipate, manage, and strategize around tax obligations, enhancing understanding of corporate tax behavior in Germany."
