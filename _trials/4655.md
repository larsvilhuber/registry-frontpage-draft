abstract: "Social motivations, such as esteem, enjoy wide recognition as critical determinants of human behavior. According to R. Akerlof (2016), esteem is defined as an individual’s judgment of how good an agent/group is compared with reference agents/groups. In this paper, we focus on two types of esteem: a person’s self-esteem and the esteem conferred on the group to which the person belongs. We extend a model based on R. Akerlof where individuals face a tradeoff between maximizing the group’s payoffs and their individual payoffs, and their willingness to maximize the group’s payoffs is positively related to the extent to which their group-esteem is higher than their self-esteem. Our main prediction is that subjects with high (low) group-esteem and low (high) self-esteem are most (least) engaged in maximizing the group’s payoffs. To test this prediction, we conduct a laboratory experiment in which self-esteem and group-esteem are manipulated through an inter-personal and inter-group competition in which subjects answer questions from an established IQ test. Subjects allocate tokens such that either their own or the group’s payoff is maximized. "
