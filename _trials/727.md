abstract: "Children of recently migrated families in slums in Dhaka, Bangladesh have lower immunization rates and higher rates of death from respiratory illnesses due to delays in seeking qualified health care services. Recently relocated families are in general poorer, less-educated, and less-knowledgeable about nearby health services. Our pilot study aims to develop and test an innovative potentially low-cost intervention in Dhaka slums using word-of-mouth information dissemination to connect community newcomers to nearby immunization centers and qualified child health services."
