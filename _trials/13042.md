abstract: "Platform markets are often dominated by a few large firms. In this project, I measure the contribution of peer effects and interoperability to these high levels of market concentration. By experimentally varying respondent's perceptions of the interoperability and peer adoption of mobile money platforms (MMPs), an important technology in low- and middle-income countries, I estimate their influence on adoption of, communication about, and preferences over dominant and competitor platforms. This experiment will allow me to parse the relative importance of social learning, complementarities between peers from on-platform interactions, and complementarities between peers from other factors such as social image concerns/mimicry/conformity. My results should inform policymakers seeking to spur adoption of or increase competition in platform industries."
