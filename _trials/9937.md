abstract: "Understanding the creation and ﬂow of knowledge is a topic of great concern both in academia and in policymaking. Citations are known to strongly influence researchers’ career paths, salaries, and reputations, as well as their departments’ and universities’ rankings. However, many factors other than scientific merit are known to affect citation trends. Here, we describe in detail a field experiment which aims to measure the impact of one factor that may affect citation trends: online visibility (i.e., overall online presence of a given article). Concretely, we designed and will run an online field experiment in which randomly selected articles from seven fields of research will be added to the English version of Wikipedia (treatment group), while others with similar characteristics will not (control group). Having done this, we will keep track of the evolution of different metrics capturing the citation performances of the articles comprising both the treatment and control groups. By exogenously varying the degree of online visibility of these articles, we will measure causal effect on citation performance of online visibility. We expect to see significant differences between both groups."
