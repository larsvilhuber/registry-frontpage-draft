abstract: "Low-income individuals face several challenges in saving formally and regularly which their employers can uniquely help them overcome. Employers can offer access to a formal payroll account, assist with documentation, and arrange for automatic deductions from the salary. 

In this study, we propose to conduct a Randomised Control Trial (RCT), wherein we offer a bank-based recurring deposit (RD) to production workers of Shahi Exports, a garment manufacturing firm in Karnataka, India. The RD would serve as a commitment saving instrument for workers, requiring fixed monthly instalments for 6 months. In our study, these instalments would be made from the workersâ€™ salary through automatic payroll deductions facilitated by Shahi, their employer. Further, for some workers savings in their RD would be linked to and rewarded based on their tenure and attendance. With this set-up, the study is aimed at understanding if performance-linked employer-enabled commitment saving plans can simultaneously improve i) formal savings of low-income workers and ii) firm performance."
