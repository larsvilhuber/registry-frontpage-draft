abstract: "The aim of this study is to explore the potential of applying machine learning (ML) to improve the efficiency of tax auditing and increase revenue gains through targeted audits. Together with the Danish Tax Agency, we are assessing the use of ML in identifying non-compliant claims of dividend withholding tax by training a model on past audits and comparing claims with different risk scores. Furthermore, we are examining the use of ML in prioritizing claims across various types of audits e.g. full-scope and limited-scope, by randomly assigning claims with different risk scores to different types of audits. The goal of this study is to showcase how machine learning can improve the selection process for dividend withholding tax claims.
