abstract: "Humans are generally motivated to make choices that earn high payoffs with a low level of risk. This trade-off can be stylized as the Stag Hunt coordination game where there exists both a payoff-dominant equilibrium and a risk-dominant equilibrium. Previous models have been provided which aim to predict when humans will coordinate on either equilibrium. Here I use a new approach to show a general disconnection between these models' predictions and actual human decision making. Furthermore, I create games for a laboratory experiment which test whether or not these models predict human behaviour well in this setting."
