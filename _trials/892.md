abstract: "In our experiment we will investigate the effect of a mass media family planning campaign on contraception related behavior. The study takes place in Burkina Faso, a country with an average of six children born to each woman, and a modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) estimated at 16% in 2014. 
 
The aim of our study is to provide robust evidence on the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of an intense 3 year mass media campaign focused on family planning. Development Media International will implement the mass media campaign in conjunction with community radio stations in Burkina Faso. Out of 16 community radio stations, 8 will be randomly selected to receive the media campaign, and the other 8 will be left as control. The radio stations are selected in a way to prevent overlap between coverage areas, and to have different local languages through which the campaign will be diffused, therefore limiting "leakages" between the treatment to the control groups. The campaign will diffuse messages about the financial and health benefits of family planning, and information on the different types, sources, advantages, and disadvantages of different contraceptive methods. In both areas that recieved the media campaign and control areas, half of sampled women will be randomly selected to receive a free radio. The study will target women at the age of reproduction to measure the effect of the intervention on mCPR, perceptions of family planning, contraception-related behavior, and general gender norms."
