abstract: "Active labour market policies (ALMPs) may play an important role in preventing an increase
in long-term unemployment following the Great Recession. We consider this issue for
Denmark, a country relying extensively on this instrument. We present evidence on the
effectiveness of ALMPs as a way of fighting youth unemployment using results from a
randomised controlled trial (RCT) that intensified the use of ALMPs. The intervention was
conducted after the onset of the financial crisis, and the findings are relatively unfavourable in
the sense that further intensification of an already quite intensive effort for youth did not
increase employment. In addition, the intensification of ALMPs seems to have in-creased
transitions into sickness benefits."
