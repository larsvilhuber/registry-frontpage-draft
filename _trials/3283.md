abstract: "We will implement a randomized control trial to explore the causal impact of a social network-based family planning intervention on young women’s contraceptive use, reproductive health, fertility and well-being in rural India. Our proposed intervention consists of a “bring-a-friend” family planning voucher package that exploits young women's social networks to reduce barriers and to improve access to high-quality family planning services. Through this study, we aim to evaluate whether enabling a woman to recruit a friend to accompany her to the clinic leads to a greater shift in family planning practices and attitudes than targeting both of those women individually. Our project aims to identify innovative and cost-effective strategies for delivering reproductive health services through social networks in low-income settings. "
