abstract: "Within a large retail chain we introduce a bonus payment and a novel monitoring scheme for store managers, implementing a 2x2 experimental design. The bonus is based on the storeâ€™s profit contribution margin (= sales - costs of goods sold - inventory shrinkage - personnel costs). The monitoring scheme is based on systematic biweekly conversation with the respective district manager about the development of the contribution margin. 
Store managers in one region in Northern Germany are randomly assigned to one of four treatments. 25% of store managers receive a bonus based on the contribution margin. Another 25% of store managers are assigned to systematic biweekly conversations with their district managers about their actions taken during the past two weeks to influence the contribution margin and their plans for the upcoming weeks. 25% of store managers receive both, the bonus and the new monitoring instrument. The remaining 25% serve as control group. 
Based on a theoretical model we hypothesize that that both, giving only the bonus as well as only implementing the monitoring scheme will increase performance compared to the control group. The combination of both will, however, not necessarily further increase the contribution margin as both instruments are substitutes rather than complements.
