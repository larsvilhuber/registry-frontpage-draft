abstract: "More than half a million prisoners are released from state and federal prisons each year. Formerly incarcerated people are nearly ten times more likely to experience homelessness than the general population, and the risk is highest in the first two years after leaving prison. Permanent supportive housing (PSH), a housing first model, provides affordable housing and support services to individuals facing homelessness, without time limits. PSH is a popular strategy for achieving stability and independence among vulnerable populations; there were over 375,000 year-round PSH beds in the United States in 2021. We will conduct and evaluate the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) of PSH for exiting prisoners at risk of homelessness. Through a partnership with the Corporation for Supportive Housing (CSH), a national leader in supportive housing, we will implement the study through two Ohio-based programs, Returning Home Ohio (RHO) and Community Transition Program (CTP). The programs offer the same services but differ in their eligibility criteria: RHO serves exiting prisoners with mental illness or HIV/AIDS, while CTP serves those with substance use disorders. We will measure the impact of PSH on criminal recidivism, housing stability, health, income, and employment. The study will enroll approximately 880 people, of whom 25 percent will be in the treatment group. "
