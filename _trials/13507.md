abstract: "This study examines the adoption of menstrual health technologies in high-severity settings, focusing on the influence of social barriers on this adoption. Conducted through a randomized control trial, the research assesses two intervention groups: one receiving standard menstrual health education and products, and the other additionally involving male household members in specialized educational sessions. Initially, we explore the demand for various menstrual technology features, along with the knowledge and needs surrounding menstruation among women in communities served by Oxfam in Mali, the Central African Republic, and Somaliland. This approach allows us to understand both the direct impact of menstrual health technologies and the role of social dynamics in their adoption."
