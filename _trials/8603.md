abstract: "Policymakers often do not want to promise flood aid ex-ante, to encourage households and firms in flood-prone areas to take up flood insurance. But ex-post, they feel compelled to provide aid to flood victims. This tension is visible in recent policy decisions in Germany, where commitments to stop providing aid were followed by promises to cover most of the damage suffered by the victims of heavy floods in the summer of 2021.

We perform an information treatment where we provide respondents with information about these policy decisions. The sample is split in three groups, which receive, respectively: 1) information about commitments to cut flood aid ("low aid"), 2) actual aid to flood victims ("high aid"), and 3) generic information about flooding world-wide.

We ask expectations of flood aid before and after the information treatment, to check whether expectations are updated. We then ask about two main outcomes: the willingness to pay for private flood insurance, and support for a policy that introduces mandatory flood insurance.

The starting hypotheses are: 

1) the high (low) flood aid treatment decreases (increases) both willingness to pay for flood insurance and support for mandatory flood insurance; 

2) the effect is concentrated among households that i) express a high concern about flood risk; and ii) update their expectations substantially as a result of the information treatment. 

We conduct separate surveys of households (online, across Germany) and firms (both by phone and online, focussing in an area with high flood risk). This trial registration refers to the household survey. The firm survey will be registered separately."
