abstract: "Female labor force participation in Egypt is among the lowest in the world, due, in part, to social norms that restrict what activities women can do outside of their homes. While in our study area only 17% believe that women should be allowed to work as an employee, 52% are supportive of women working as a volunteer even though volunteers receive financial compensation. In this project, we will visit 7,500 households and encourage women to apply for work opportunities that are either referred to as “employment” or as “volunteering” but otherwise have the same job characteristics, including compensation, hours and contract. In addition to randomizing the name of the work opportunity across 500 geographically distant agglomerations, we will randomize at the household level whether we target women only or whether we also involve other household members in order to better understand household decision making and how to alleviate constraints to women’s work out of the home. After comparing application behavior across these four treatment arms, we will randomize work opportunities among applicants. This will allow us to estimate the impact of working on the female applicants and their families, and compare work performance and satisfaction across treatment arms."
