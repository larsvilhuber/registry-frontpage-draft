abstract: "Students must continuously decide how much time and effort they want to invest in their studies. However, the necessary information for these decisions may be uncertain, not salient enough, or not known at all. For example, students may wonder how much effort and which challenges they will face in future semesters, they may not remember all the reasons why they started their degree program, and they may lack new facts that could affect their original motivation for studying.

In this research project, we investigate the effects of providing students with information about time investments on academic performance. In our first treatment, students receive information about how much time similar students spent on their studies on average. In the second treatment, students are additionally informed about the time they need to invest in each subsequent semester of studying. Our third and main treatment is motivated by research outside the context of education which shows that sunk costs may mitigate limited memory and affect subsequent decisions by providing individuals with information about their initial evaluation of a project. To apply the sunk-cost effect to higher education, we inform students in this treatment group about the time they have already invested in their studies. "
