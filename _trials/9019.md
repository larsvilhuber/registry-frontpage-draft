abstract: "Social skills are essential to building empowered and cohesive communities in ethnic diversity contexts. Recent evidence indicates that the school environment and, in particular, teaching practices are important in shaping these skills, especially for socioeconomically disadvantaged children. This project aims to design and evaluate a teacher-focused pedagogical program to promote the social inclusion of migrant children in Italian schools. The program will focus on social skills that are fundamental to healthy peer interactions, with a particular emphasis on inter-ethnic relationships. We will evaluate the program using a rich set of outcomes by combining administrative data with surveys and incentivized lab-in-the-field behavioral tasks."
