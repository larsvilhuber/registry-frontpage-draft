abstract: "Artificial intelligence (AI) is often described as the fuel that will propel a fourth industrial revolution, but we are still learning whether its widespread adoption will be embraced by individuals or whether it will be met with fear and backlash. In this project, we use RCT to seek to understand the effects of AI adoption on political preferences."
