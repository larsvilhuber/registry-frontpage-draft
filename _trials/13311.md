abstract: "Female-owned firms in Sub-Saharan Africa have lower profits and less access to capital. A common approach to promoting capital access for female business owners is to reserve loans or other capital for women. However, loan application processes remain a barrier to access. Using an information experiment with female small business owners in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, we study whether limiting loans to female business owners increases women's willingness to apply for those loans. This is a follow-up study to "Gender, Competition, and Requests for Capital: Experimental Evidence on Female Prioritization" (AEARCTR-0011271)."
