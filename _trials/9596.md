abstract: "We evaluate a program that promotes social and economic integration of recent migrants to Sweden by matching them with a Swedish buddy (an established Swede) in order to create local social ties through repeated social interaction. The program is implemented in the broader Stockholm area by the Kompis Sverige (KS), a non-governmental organization partner. We use an oversubscription-based individualized lottery to select roughly 400-500 migrants (out of 800-1000) to be matched to a Swedish peer and we aim to study outcomes at 6 and 12 months. Key outcomes are: social inclusion (culturally and socially), social attitudes, especially on belongingness, measures of Swedish language ability, and current employment and education status."
