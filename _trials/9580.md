abstract: "We study the long-term impacts of offering monetary incentives for vaccination on future vaccination uptake. To do so, we exploit the setting of an earlier study that offered payment to people for getting a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine (Campos-Mercade et al., 2021), which provides us with random variation in exposure to monetary incentives. In a survey, we ask participants whether they got a third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (booster shot)."
