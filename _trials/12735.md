abstract: "In the EU, investment advisors must now elicit retail investors’ sustainability preferences (ESMA Guidelines Sep 2022).  Through an online trial with survey participants, we intend to test a number of alternative question sets to elicit sustainability preferences with a view to experimentally testing which version most closely matches revealed preferences from an investment game. We will also check which question set is associated with greater understanding of sustainable investments among the survey panel. Our results will aid discussions around the guidelines, which ultimately have the potential to shape household portfolio allocations to sustainable finance."
