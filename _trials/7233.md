abstract: "We study to what information and benchmark voters update beliefs regarding corruption when they are presented with ``objective'' information about malfeasance.  We conducted and mixed within-between subjects design, where respondents will receive different information about corruption using different benchmarks. The treatment consists of 6 short videos with different information about malfeasance. 
 
For all video treatments, we will measure beliefs about the prevalence of corruption using different metrics 1) beliefs about the prevalence of corruption using a 0 - 10 scale; 2) beliefs about the prevalence of corrupt behavior by civil servants in that local government; and 3) beliefs about the economic impacts of corruption.
