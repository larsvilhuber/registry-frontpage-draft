abstract: "In this randomised controlled trial study, we will evaluate the impact of three communication-based interventions, delivered remotely, on improving the consumption of Iron and Folic Acid (IFA) supplements during pregnancy in rural India. Our interventions aim to make the risks of anemia for both mother and child salient, increase the value  perception of IFA supplements amongst pregnant women, and support the habit formation of their daily consumption. We test for these interventions using two experiments; in the first, we randomize pregnant women with access to Whatsapp between control and a treatment, where the treatment group is given simplified counselling over the phone followed by some visual reinforcements over Whatsapp; in our second, we randomize pregnant women without access to Whatsapp between control and two treatments, where one treatment group is given simplified counselling over the phone followed by regular prescriptions of IFA tablets sent through SMS, and the second treatment group is sent catchy and tuneful IVRS reminders for regular tablet consumption. We deploy our experiments in rural Uttar Pradesh, with a sample of 1929 pregnant women."
