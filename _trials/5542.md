abstract: "Research that leverages social norms to induce desirable behaviour has generally studied norm-based interventions when decisions are made by individuals. However, in reality decisions are often made by groups. This is particular true for natural resource use in developing countries.
With our experiment, we aim to build a bridge between the lab and the field to inform policy makers whether a norm-nudge could improve resource management at Lake Victoria, Tanzania.
We study the effect of norm-nudges by varying whether participants are given social information about past behavior of other groups.
Groups in our experiment are recruited from fishing crews.
At Lake Victoria, there are two relevant forms of decision making on board. 
Decisions are either made by all crew members together (majority) or by a captain (representative).
Thus, we study the effect of a norm-nudge both when group action is determined by majority, or by a randomly selected representative."
