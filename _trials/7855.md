abstract: "In Ethiopia, entrenched gender norms continue to prescribe the burden of domestic duties to women, even as many women run their own business. Most of these businesses are small and tend to significantly underperform their male-owned counterparts. This project seeks to understand to what extent the norm that women do the bulk of housework and childcare constrains female-owned enterprises. More specifically, we estimate the payment premium female entrepreneurs require relative to their husbands to accept additional work opportunities and examine how much of this premium is explained by an unwillingness to perform gender-coded tasks."
