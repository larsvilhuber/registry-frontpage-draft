abstract: "We are conducting an intervention to motivate girls in colleges in Haryana, a state in India, to continue pursuing studies in Economics. Given the state's entrenched gender norms, we aim to see if exposure to female role models can change their aspirations, performance in college exams, dropout rate and interest/enrolment in pursuing a Masters in Economics. Our experiment involves showing college students recorded videos of six female role models with roots in Haryana and a background in Economics working in various fields such as academia, corporate, and bureaucracy. Each role model will share her journey, the obstacles she faced, and how she overcame them along with sharing her professional work. By showcasing these diverse success stories, we hope to inspire and encourage the girls to advance in the field of Economics."
