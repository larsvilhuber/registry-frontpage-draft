abstract: "We investigate the impact of CEO activism, the increasingly more common practice of CEOs speaking out on controversial social and political issues, on firm value. CEO activism may be beneficial for shareholders, as it can bolster firms' relationships with customers and employees. Alternatively, CEO activism may be detrimental to firm value if it alienates important stakeholders with opposing views. Consistent with the former, we find that CEO activism results in a positive market reaction and higher valuations. Firms with CEO activism have higher sales, exhibit higher employee productivity, and innovate more. Additionally, activist CEOs are rewarded with more directorships and a reduced likelihood of turnover."
