abstract: "Nearly 98 percent of businesses in India are microenterprises that are susceptible to income shocks and lack access to capital. These conditions challenge their growth, profitability and survival, particularly for women led microenterprises. While many entrepreneurs have access to microcredit, these loans typically come with rigid repayment schedules that often deter entrepreneurs from channeling money into their business. We run a field experiment to test the effectiveness of microequity contracts, which are characterized by revenue contingent repayments over a three-year term. Working with women microentrepreneurs, we explore how microequity contracts affect microenterprise growth."
