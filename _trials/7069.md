abstract: "The realization rule is central to income tax law, but often decreases the efficiency, equity, and simplicity of the system.  Given these problems, it is surprising that we do not have a good explanation for why the rule exists for liquid assets.  Scholars have long speculated about the role of the publicâ€™s views here, but little is known empirically about them.  We conduct the first survey experiment to understand the psychology of taxing gains on unsold assets."
