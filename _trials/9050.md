abstract: "In this paper, we study contract enforcement in the illegal gambling market of Pakistan as gamblers make high-stakes betting decisions without the state enforcing contracts. Our experimental intervention randomly assigns gamblers with additional week to honor their book bets –a contract that allows them to pay back the week after and to a treatment arm that makes blacklisting from betting market salient in the contract. We observe the pattern of repayment by gamblers in absence of any state authority enforcing these contracts. We also investigate two potential mechanisms behind the blacklisting 1) imposition of reputational costs in case of nonpayment  2) collusion utilization in case of non-payment. The mechanism underpinning the blacklisting is evaluated via a factorial design: we rerandomize gamblers into a treatment arm that imposes reputation costs in event of non-payment or informs the collusion by informing the race “guild” about the non-repayment. Finally, we examine the impact of a much-used decision aid, odds and historical data relevant to the bet, to investigate whether reducing uncertainty about the outcome affect the decision to bet. We observe winnings and losses of gamblers, payback rates and collect rich set of behavioral data in the form of strategic dilemmas on risk, confidence, cooperation and coordination.
