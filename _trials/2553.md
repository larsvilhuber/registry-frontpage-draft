abstract: "Understanding the role of information is at the core of democratic accountability and the the often-broken representative-constituent link. Representatives face strong incentives to reduce the dissemination of information about their policy promises to avoid tying their hands, and to avoid being held accountable for failing to meet them, especially so when the private returns to public office are high. When the media sector is underdeveloped then this results in a low-quality, low-information equilibrium where democratic accountability suffers. We evaluate the impact of an initiative designed to simultaneously shock the supply of programmatic information by candidates and the credibility of the media sector. We do this by leveraging experimental evidence from a nationwide debate initiative ahead of Liberiaâ€™s 2017 elections for House of Representatives designed to solicit concrete policy promises from candidates. With random variation in the participation of political candidates and the intensity of debate broadcasting through community radio stations, we aim to parse how variation in exposure to the policy platforms of candidates affects levels of political information, voting behavior, electoral returns, and the role of the media in intermediating these effects. Ultimately, we want to assess whether the intervention was successful at breaking this low-quality, low-information equilibrium."
