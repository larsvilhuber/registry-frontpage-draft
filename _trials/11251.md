abstract: "Intra-household constraints imposed by inefficient bargaining or household production may contribute to gender gaps in entrepreneurship outcomes. In this study using randomized assignment we test whether the economic returns to a mindset-oriented business skills intervention to female firm owners are higher when incorporating curricula designed to encourage greater spousal support for women. The couples' training component involves modelling effective communication techniques for women entrepreneurs and their male partners with training content focused on financial, network, and time resource allocation within the household. Results from this study will contribute to the evidence base on engaging men to support economic opportunities for women."
