abstract: "Individuals make decisions based on their intrinsic preferences but are also influenced by the decisions of others. Conformity refers to the tendency to align one's choice with that of others, while anticonformity is characterized by a deliberate effort to oppose others' choices. These two behaviors—conformity and anticonformity—are opposites in terms of social utility: conformists seek to align, whereas anticonformists aim to oppose. This study explores, in theory and in a laboratory experiment, the interaction between personal preferences and social influence, specifically conformity and anticonformity. It examines how induced intrinsic preferences and induced (anti-)conformity preferences interact, and which of these factors is more dominant in decision-making. Additionally, the research investigates whether individual characteristics, such as susceptibility to social pressure, influence behavior. To assess these preferences, we use the Revised Self-Monitoring Scale and the Concern for Appropriateness Scale, translated into French. The study also controls for social preferences (SVO) to better understand the role of social influence on decision-making."
