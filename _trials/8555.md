abstract: "As new technologies emerge, hiring is becoming increasingly automated. Organisations are beginning to utilise Artificial Intelligence for the purposes of making hiring decisions, but this adoption has been controversial. Opinions differ on the outcomes of using Artificial Intelligence , with some claiming it can reduce bias, and others claiming it will perpetuate human biases. In particular, assessing candidate perceptions towards the use of Artificial Intelligence in the hiring process has been an emerging area of research, as understanding how candidates feel towards the technology can have implications for the competitive war for talent. This study looks at the perceived fairness and intentions to seek litigation from candidates in a simulated hiring process. Using a vignette style experiment, participants read a hiring process and then state their opinions on it as well as answer questionnaires on individual differences. We assess 9 hiring process conditions with a 3x3 between-subjects design varying on hiring decision maker and stage of recruitment process. "
