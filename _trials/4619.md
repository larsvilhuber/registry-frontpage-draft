abstract: "While advanced degree programs in Business strive to achieve diversity in their ranks, there is little empirical evidence on how to effectively increase the share of some underrepresented groups who may be self-selecting out. We randomly vary the content of informational emails to potential candidates to highlight the diversity of profiles who pursue a degree as well as the breadth of admissionsâ€™ criteria (other than GMAT scores)."
