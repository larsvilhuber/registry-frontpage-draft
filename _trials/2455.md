abstract: "In mathematics instruction, it is quite common for teachers to explain a topic and then assign their students a number of practice exercises - either as classwork or homework - to build "procedural knowledge" (i.e., knowledge about the algorithms to be followed to solve a specific problem) and "fluency" (i.e., capacity to solve these problems rapidly). Although there is general agreement among educators that this strategy is beneficial, prior studies have not determined the extent to which students benefit more from this practice. We will use a computer-assisted learning (CAL) software called "Mindspark" to randomly assign 5,756 students in grades 4-7 in 9 private schools in India to receiving or not receiving practice exercises after they learn a new mathematical concept, and to assess the impact on their procedural knowledge and fluency."
