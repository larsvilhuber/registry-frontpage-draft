abstract: "The economics and education literatures traditionally view human capital as an individual's stock of knowledge and skills. In this project, we posit an additional potential component: the capacity for sustained attention. In cognitive psychology, the mind's ability to direct and sustain attention is thought to underlie all activity: cognitive processes (such as solving a math problem) as well as non-cognitive activities (such as exerting self-control) (Chun et al. 2011). In this project, we examine whether the capacity for exerting sustained attention is malleable. Using a field experiment, we introduce a novel tablet-based adaptive learning platform into low-income Indian primary schools. The platform engages students in sustained practice in either mathematics or cognitive activities for 30 minutes at a time, several days a week for the academic school year. For many students, who typically face disruptive classroom environments and exert little focused direction of attention at home or school, this intervention drastically boosts the amount of sustained attentional practice they receive. We will quantify treatment effects on sustained attention using standard laboratory tests from cognitive psychology, practical tests of attention and performance decline over the course of traditional subject tests. If we find impacts on such outcomes, this would suggest broadening our view of the cognitive dimensions of human capital, and how it is shaped through schooling."
