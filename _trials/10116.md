abstract: "This article shows the effect of providing feedback to university students of the Rey Juan Carlos University of Madrid on their percentile in the distribution of grades in different tests carried out throughout the second semester of the 2022 academic year. To carry out the study, carried out a randomized experiment among students, with the aim of determining whether greater transparency in the results throughout the semester increased performance at the end of the course. It is intended to demonstrate that informing students about their relative position during the semester based on the percentile they obtain with respect to the class can achieve added motivation in order to improve final grades."
