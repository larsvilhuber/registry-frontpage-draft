abstract: "We conduct an online experiment with a sample representative of the German internet-using population. We endow participants with Credits they may choose to contribute to a large public good or use for private consumption. Contributions to the large public good are real carbon emission reductions. We conduct a questionnaire prior to and after the experiment."
