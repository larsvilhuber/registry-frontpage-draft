abstract: "Access to justice and criminal dispute resolution is a first-order issue in many emerging economies. In Pakistan, citizens dissatisfied with the state tend to shift towards a variety of non-state actors, weakening the efficacy of state institutions to resolve crimes and improve public safety. This study builds upon previous research which found that citizens increase their desired usage of and giving to the state when provided information about judicial improvements (Acemoglu et al. 2020). In a unique collaboration with the Punjab Safe Cities Authority, this study focuses on enhancing citizen engagement with state policing and judicial services. Identifying a population that is currently experiencing a dispute, we experimentally introduce interventions that provide information on and/or direct exposure to enhanced services for citizens (an additional police complaint hotline and legal advisory services) and measure these interventionsâ€™ impact on dispute resolution, citizen satisfaction, and engagement with and perceptions of the police and state actors."
