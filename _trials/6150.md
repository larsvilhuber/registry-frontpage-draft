abstract: "This trial will randomly assign approximately 5,000 low-income individuals in the United States to receive either no cash, $500, or $2,000 unconditionally. While the primary purpose of the trial is to test the effects of these cash transfers on a range of financial, psychological, and health outcomes (preregistered separately on this registry), this preregistration discusses how the trial will be used to test a different research question. In particular, it will test to what extent one’s own level of resources or need for help affects one’s beliefs about others’ need for help. (To see the primary preregistration, please see "A Randomized Controlled Trial Varying Unconditional Cash Transfer Amounts in the United States," by Oliver Hauser, Jon Jachimowicz, Julian Jamison, and Ania Jaroszewicz.)"
