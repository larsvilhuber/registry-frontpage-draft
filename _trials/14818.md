abstract: "This project explores and elucidates the complex pathways through which men’s attitudes and behavior towards Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) evolve, as well as their tolerance for violence. By analyzing this, the project seeks to understand, challenge and alter the normalization of violence against women with the aim of fostering positive gender – related outcomes in the future. The specific goal of the project is to investigate whether a small and intensive intervention can help combat violence against women and contribute to shaping views, promoting positive attitudes, and encouraging constructive behaviors.

We plan to conduct a field experiment with male participants in Thiruvananthapuram district, Kerala, India. We chose Kerala because, despite its advanced socio-economic indicators and high literacy rates, the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) reports that a significant portion of the population justifies wife-beating which suggests strong cultural norms might be at play. This contradiction provides a critical context for exploring the impact of social norms on IPV. We particularly selected Thiruvananthapuram due to the recent upsurge of IPV-related cases in the district.
