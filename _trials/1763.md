abstract: "This paper exploits a recently implemented randomised control trial in Madagascar that focused on management reforms. It investigates whether the impact of the reforms varies by the type of teacher. This is an important issue because Madagascar, like many other developing countries, has recently hired a large number of contract or temporary teachers, who have less training but may be motivated to work harder in order to have their contracts renewed. The management reforms did not have any impact on student test scores. This lack of an impact holds for all types of teachers. It may be that two years is not enough time for the program to have had a measurable impact, but it is also possible that the program is ineffective, at least in the context of Madagascar's educational system.
