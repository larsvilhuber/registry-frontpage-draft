abstract: "In this project, we estimate ``Generalized Social Marginal Welfare Weights" (henceforth welfare weights), introduced by Saez and Stantcheva (2016), using an experimental approach. Welfare weights measure the value of providing an additional dollar of consumption to any individual in the society. These weights are general enough to capture many different fairness ideals. In a variety of policy settings, such as  taxation, cash transfers, and in-kind transfers, welfare weights can be used to compare alternative policies. To understand how people assign welfare weights, we administer a large-scale incentivized online experiment in a general population sample of the U.S. population. In our experiment, participants in the role of ``Social Architects,"  assign welfare weights to seven real ``Recipients" with different real-world after-tax incomes. We provide the first estimate of welfare weights using a general population sample of the U.S. population. The weights obtained from our project can be directly used to evaluate several policies such as taxation, cash transfers, and in-kind transfers. We shed light on the factors (both demographics and political affiliations) that affect people's welfare preferences. Finally, we compare the welfare weights obtained from our experiment to the weights implied by existing policies in the U.S."
