abstract: "Introduction: Norwegian alcohol policy measures include national restrictions on sales hours and a state monopoly on retail sales of strong beer, wine and spirits. Medium strength beer is sold in licensed grocery stores. 
A one-hour extension of sales hours per week in the monopoly outlets can take effect from September 1st 2020. The Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care requested the Norwegian Institute of Public Health to evaluate possible effects of this change. 
We aim to evaluate whether this increase in sales hours results in 1) an increase in alcohol sales in the monopoly outlets, and 2) an increase in total alcohol sales, including possible substitution effects from beer sales in grocery stores.

Design and methods: The state monopoly has agreed to implement extension of sales hours within a cluster randomised controlled trial design, to render possible an effect evaluation of this policy change. The unit of randomisation is trade district (total n=67 in Norway). Block randomisation of 62 of the 67 trade districts will allocate monopoly outlets to one of three experimental conditions regarding date of implementation of extended trading hours; i) September 1st 2020; ii) December 1st 2020, and  iii) March 1st 2021. The extension of sales hours will be from 3 pm to 4 pm on Saturdays. Data on monthly sales of alcohol (total and beverage specific) in all monopoly outlets and  grocery stores in Norway Norway will be obtained for a period of 72 months prior to – and 24 months after – implementation (i.e. from September 1st 2014 to March 1st 2023). Simulations suggest an increase in wine sales of 3.5%, which would be statistically significant under reasonable assumptions of power and analysis model.    

Conclusion: The planned randomised controlled trial offers a rare opportunity to study possible causal effects of a relatively small change in a widely used alcohol policy measure.
