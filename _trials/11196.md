abstract: "Due in large part to the proliferation of literatures in behavioral public administration, citizen-state interactions, administrative burden, and coproduction in public services, the micro-foundations of citizen behavior have seen significant growth in recent years. As part of this agenda, the once conventional depictions of citizens as passive participants in bureaucratic encounters are being replaced with depictions of citizens as active participants who express agency, preference, and choice. Indeed, these recent theoretical and empirical developments emphasize that citizens are not a monolithic group, but rather that individual experiences, sociodemographic identities, and social constructions are all important characteristics that shape how citizens interact with bureaucracy, and who they choose to interact with. We use a conjoint experiment to explore how citizens, when they have options, choose bureaucrats and the types of values, choices, and tradeoffs inherent to these decisions. Building on prior work examining citizen preferences for symbolic representation, we examine whether preferences for in-group symbolic representation (having a bureaucrat who "looks like me") are dampened in the presence of substantive cues regarding representative role acceptance (bureaucrats adopting the role of advancing the interests of a particular social group)."
