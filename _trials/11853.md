abstract: "We use a novel incentivized revealed preference experiment in a large hierarchical organization. Respondents
must make binary choices with real incentives similar to those faced in their normal duties. We then test how
decisions change when we change the information environment by (a) varying information provided about field
conditions in each choice, (b) varying how information flows within the hierarchy between respondents who are
managers and subordinates, and (c) varying the conditions under which decisions are made. We consider the
implications for optimal organizational design."
