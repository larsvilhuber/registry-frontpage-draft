abstract: "The  number  of  rigorous  studies  on  “what  works”  to  foster  education  in  less developed  countries  has  strongly  increased,  but  there  is  surprisingly  little  evidence on  how  to  improve  child  learning  through  changes  in  instructional  practice.  We study  the  effect  of  an  innovative  program  in  Karnataka,  India,  that  promotes activity-based  learning  through  teacher  training,  community  engagement,  and additional  inputs. In  a  Randomized  Controlled  Trial  (RCT),  we  will  assign  98  administrative units  (Gram  Panchayats)  and  their  294  schools  to  either  receiving  the  program,or  not.  Our  primary  outcome  of  interest  is  child  learning,  in  mathematics,  for students  enrolled  in  grade  four  (at  baseline).  Sub-group  analyses  will  focus  on differential  effects  by  students’  initial  ability  level,  by  gender,  and  by  geographic location  (i.e.,  by  district).  The  study’s  secondary  analyses  investigate  changes  in observed  instructional  behaviors  and  the  program’s  implementation  fidelity."
