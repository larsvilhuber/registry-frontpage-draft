abstract: "In this trial, we want to analyze the differences between individuals' and groups' ambiguity attitudes. For this purpose, we look not only at the gain domain but also at the loss domain, since ambiguity attitudes can also be influenced by loss aversions. Furthermore, we try to find out exploratively how the groups arrived at a decision and which factors might have influenced the group decision (and thus potentially also the ambiguity attitude).
