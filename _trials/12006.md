abstract: "The incentives of the workers are not always fully aligned with the manager's. This paper uses a field experiment to understand which types of incentives, other than workers’ salaries, can be provided when more than one factor is crucial for the firms’ productivity. In this industry, salary incentivises all workers individually for one of the factors, and this intervention introduces a team incentive to improve the other factor. Moreover, I will run surveys and economic games to get richer data on team characteristics that might matter for the team incentive’s efficacy."
