abstract: "A widespread concern exists regarding social media contributing to political polarization. Social media sites, by promoting the creation of “echo chambers” (situations in which beliefs are amplified or reinforced by communication and repetition inside closed systems), are believed to distort the salience of some beliefs and perceptions, potentially leading to polarized views. However, given that signing-up in a social network is not mandatory, a valid argument is that the presence of polarization patterns documented in social networks may arise in part because of their users being particularly prone to polarization. In other words, patterns observed in social networks may be simply the consequence of self-selection. Disentangling the magnitudes of these effects --polarization effectively caused by exposure to social media versus selection bias-- remains an open question.

We will conduct an experiment with participants from two populations: participants with and without Twitter accounts. Participants will randomly watch either a live stream of Argentina’s 2019 presidential debate or a placebo video. Also randomly, during the debate Twitter users will be asked to turn off their phones, to use their Twitter accounts as they wish, or to post content on their Twitter accounts. In this way, we plan to measure and compare two things. First, the way in which different degrees of access to social media affect polarization indices and stress levels. Second, the differential reactions on these variables for Twitter and non-Twitter users. This evidence will help to disentangle the roles of exposure and selection in the polarization observed in social media."
