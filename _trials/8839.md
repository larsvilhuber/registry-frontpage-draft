abstract: "In order to promote a healthy diet in a successful way, individuals’ knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and behavior towards food must be taken into consideration. The aim of this food-related survey is to investigate the following: i) whether individuals perceive certain products as healthy or unhealthy; ii) which factors drive subjects’ choice towards one product or another (price, taste, etc.); iii) subjects’ beliefs on which food the majority of individuals perceive as healthy; iv) whether people who have been affected by covid-19 (with loss of taste and smell) attribute more or less importance to taste in making their food choice; v) whether the perception of products as healthy differs between people who have been affected by covid-19 or not; vi) whether people feel happier to switch from a portion of unhealthy food to a healthy one if they are driven by intrinsic motivation (sticking on their intentions of having a good diet) or extrinsic motivation (adhering to a government policy aiming at promoting healthy food). In addition to the investigation of the above questions, we will use the results of this survey to select the snacks to use in a subsequent lab experiment. In particular, in the lab experiment, we will use the snacks that individuals declare to perceive as healthy in the survey."
