abstract: "We describe the analysis plan for an online intervention designed to examine how inducing participants to think about the values instilled in the military affects values and views related to nation-building, civic values, and social cohesion more broadly. The study will be conducted online with men of 45 years and older living in Argentina. Participants will share their opinion about the lessons and values that serving in the military taught those who were conscripted. The primary experimental treatment is the order in which individuals respond to this open-ended question. We outline the study design, the treatments, the main heterogeneous treatment effects that we will examine, and the econometric strategy for the analysis."
