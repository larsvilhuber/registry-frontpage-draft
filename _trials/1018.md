abstract: "The project studies if there are any systematic differences in social preferences between managers and people in general.  More specifically, the project examines if the sources of income and the cost of redistribution matter for people in the two groups when they make distribution decisions.  Given this information, we can study the prevalence of different fairness ideals in the two groups. That is, are people motivated by different moral norms when they decide on important distributive issues? 
Additionally, the project measures existence of dishonesty.  It aims at mapping any pattern of lying behaviour amongst managers and people in general, and test for any difference in this pattern between the two groups. The project also aims to explore if a high degree of honesty in a group correlates with social preferences in the group.
Next, the project examines if there is a relationship between distributive choices and attitudes towards materialistic values and willingness to compete, respectively. The project also aims to explore if there is a correlation on group level between existence of dishonesty and focus on materialistic values and willingness to compete, respectively.  
Finally, if there are differences between the two groups regarding these questions, how can it be explained? Do demographic and/or socio-economic variables make a difference?  Are  managers – for example  – initially more concerned with economic incentives than others, and thus have selected a working carrier accordingly, or have exposure to economic incentives influenced their behaviour over time?
