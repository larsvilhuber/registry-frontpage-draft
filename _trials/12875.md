abstract: "Modern social communication systems–ranging from email to social media systems–present a dizzying number of decisions for users. Privacy configurations, when not hidden by social media companies, are opaque. Individuals sometimes are also not aware of the externality that their sharing decisions can have to others. Thus, it is often hard for individuals to react or behave in ways that model the personal behaviors or are communally advantageous. Personalized recommendations, interfaces, interventions or nudges can help but implementing these requires an understanding end-user preferences. Our research seeks to tackle this challenge by modeling individual preferences through the use of economic games, both in a neutral context and in specific scenarios. Simultaneously, we will collect user preferences in actual social and communication systems. We propose to connect the game-modeled behaviors with real-world preferences. Doing so will allow us to create interventions that can help align interface settings with real preferences or can nudge towards better decisions."
