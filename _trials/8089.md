abstract: "This project involves a series of online surveys (with an experimental component) on representative population samples in the UK, Brazil and China to study normative preferences and perceptions about wellbeing. Preferences related to well-being/welfare/life satisfaction, their relationship to death and non-existence, one's understanding of other's (goal directed agents') wellbeing in relationship to their own, tradeoffs between money, health, social standing, etc., and ethical preferences related to the existence of future and current populations are all idiosyncratic and donâ€™t necessarily have an objective right answer. We try to measure these by asking people directly using a stated preference survey that will allow us to determine median valuations and tradeoffs for key variables; variations by individual background characteristics; differences across the countries; and importantly, the effects of debiasing interventions on these answers."
