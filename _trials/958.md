abstract: "Neurobiological science has established that the first three years of life lay the basis for lifelong outcomes due to the rapid development of the brain. During this period, children are also vulnerable to negative influences of a number of biological and psychosocial factors such as malnutrition, illness and unstimulating environments. These factors may be induced by poverty and may have a detrimental effect on children’s health and development, including physical, cognitive, language and motor development. Research has shown that approaches to early childhood development (ECD) that involve psychosocial stimulation and/or nutrition are effective in mitigating influences of negative factors. Our aim is to understand the cost, sustainability and effects of such approach and the mechanisms needed for these early years’ interventions to be effective in poor populations. We need to know how the interventions change beliefs, knowledge and parenting practices as well as the specific investments (in time and resources) that parents and caregivers make in child rearing. We need to identify how specific investment choices are translated into individual child development outcomes. Our research agenda comprises evaluating two different modes of delivering an ECD intervention coupled with nutritional information through a randomised control trial in 192 villages in rural Odisha. Odisha provides an excellent setting for the study as it represents a prototypical context of low levels of stimulation, high malnutrition, poor developmental outcomes and extreme levels of poverty. The study will permit us to learn the extent to which an early childhood stimulation and nutrition intervention is feasible and effective in improving child health and development in low-income and disadvantaged environments."
