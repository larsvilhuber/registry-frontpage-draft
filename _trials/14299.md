abstract: "We study the role of information frictions in migration decisions and aspirations as well as the effect that these frictions have on human capital decisions and aspirations. We conduct a large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) in rural areas in Senegal with two treatment groups, each receiving different sets of information, and a control group that does not receive any information. The first treatment group receives information on predicted personalized income changes and predicted income gains for having apprenticeship training when moving from rural to urban areas in Senegal. These estimates are based on a survey conducted in urban areas. The second treatment group receives information on legal migration routes to the United States. We aim to determine whether these treatments alter the migration intentions, behaviors, and aspirations of the treated individuals."
