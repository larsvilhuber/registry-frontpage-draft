abstract: "This is a replication of Nikiforakis, Nikos. "Punishment and counter-punishment in public good games: Can we really govern ourselves?." Journal of Public Economics 92, no. 1-2 (2008): 91-112..  In the original paper, they test whether a counter-punishment opportunity affects cooperation in the provision of public goods. We conduct a laboratory public good experiment considering only two of his treatment conditions; one without any punishment – the standard public good game which is also known as the voluntary contribution mechanism (VCM); and one with two-sided punishment – that is, a VCM followed by a stage of punishment and a stage of counter-punishment (PCP). We expect our results shed light on the directional effect of the counter-punishment opportunity in public good games and help us extend the study in future.  "
