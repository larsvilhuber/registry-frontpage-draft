abstract: "In this project, we examine the extent to which targeted coaching can improve the non-cognitive skills and academic outcomes of college
students. To explore this issue, we create a non-cognitive skills profile for incoming students at a southwestern public university. Using a field
experiment, we randomly assign students to one of three groups: (i) a control group, (ii) a passive intervention group, and (iii) an active
intervention group. The students belonging to the passive intervention group are exposed to information about their non-cognitive skills profile and the challenges they are likely to face in college because of deficits in their non-cognitive skills. In addition to receiving this information, students in the active intervention group are also directed to various services at the university to help them address any deficits in their non-cognitive skills profile that may hinder their academic success. We examine the impact of each treatment on students' short- and long-term academic outcomes. "
