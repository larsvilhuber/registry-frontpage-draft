abstract: "In an online survey, we elicit perceived similarity between respondents and individuals from three foreign countries, as well as contact between respondents and individuals with ancestry from the same three foreign countries. Using information on respondents' county of residence, we will combine these data with a measure of charitable donations from US counties to the countries of interest (Bursztyn et al. 2023), and instrument contact using historical migrations (push and pull factors) that predict the contemporaneous distribution of foreign ancestry across counties in the US (Burchardi et al. 2019). 

We hypothesize that contact between respondents and individuals of a given foreign ancestry causally increases perceived similarity and generosity toward others from that foreign country.
