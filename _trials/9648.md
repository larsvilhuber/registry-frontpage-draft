abstract: "Computer-aided learning (CAL) can play a vital role in reducing learning gaps in developing countries by providing low-cost access to supplemental learning. While existing studies have focused on the effects of computer-based learning systems on older students, the impact of CAL on younger children during their formative years is still unknown. In our study, we will evaluate the effect of a “formative teaching” CAL model for foundational learning where teachers in grades 1 and 2 will leverage a game-based software, Chimple, to assign supplemental at-home learning activities. 

The intervention will be implemented in public schools managed by the Bharti Foundation in Haryana, India. These schools primarily serve students from low-income backgrounds. Hence, the intervention will also illuminate the efficacy of this product for improving outcomes for marginalized populations. As schools return to in-person learning, technology-aided supplemental learning can play an instrumental role in helping teachers address a heterogeneous classroom. In addition to evaluating a teacher-driven model where students are encouraged to continue using the software because their teacher assigns content regularly, we will also randomly assign parents into two groups, with one group receiving low-intensity and the other receiving high-intensity nudges, to study how engagement responds to reminders.
