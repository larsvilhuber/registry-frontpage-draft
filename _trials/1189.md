abstract: "This project will examine how (i) different types of health information, and (ii) time availability affect people’s dietary choices. The main motivation behind this study is the idea that people may have limited cognitive resources and would thus prioritise other issues or problems rather than their dietary or lifestyle choices, instead relying on heuristics and defaults when making such decisions. Therefore, under such circumstances the provision of public health information may have little impact on people's choices, particularly such information is perceived as being of limited relevance or salience. In order to tackle these issues, we propose a lab experiment where in the first instance, participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups – no information (the control group), generic health information, and targeted health information. In the generic health treatment, subjects will be exposed to standard health information on heart disease and diabetes issued by organisations like the UK’s National Health Service and the British Heart Foundation. In the targeted information treatment, subjects will obtain personalised health information via a specialised computer-based tool that calculates the relative risk of contracting heart disease or diabetes as well as suggestions to reduce this risk (e.g. eat more fruit & vegetables). In the second part of the experiment subjects would be allocated a fixed budget in order to spend on various food and drink items available from a specially-designed online supermarket, containing a mixture of obesogenic and healthy food and drinks. It is at this stage that the second level of variation will be introduced since subjects (across all information groups) will be randomly-assigned into two further groups – a high-priority group and a low-priority group. The high-priority group will be allowed 10 minutes in order to make their dietary choices from the virtual supermarket, while the low-priority group will only be allowed 3 minutes to make their choices. We will then use the nutritional information from the chosen basket of food and drink in order to determine the impact of health information and time availability on individual food choices, controlling for a number of factors like prior health knowledge, prior health status (and knowledge of such status), dietary habits, socio-economic factors and demographic indicators. We will also conduct a follow-up session 3 months later in order to measure the long-term impact of information provision on people's food choices.   "
