abstract: "This paper examines attitudes toward climate change in Russia, a fossil fuel-dependent economy. We conduct a survey based on a modified version of Dechezleprêtre et al. (2022), which did not include Russia in its original scope. While retaining the core structure of the original survey, we introduce three novel components. First, we explore within-country variation in public knowledge, opinions, and support for climate policies, with a particular focus on differences between fossil fuel-rich and fossil fuel-poor regions. Second, we expand the original set of randomized treatments by incorporating informational videos on various aspects of the 2023 Presidential Decree, which outlines the government’s official stance on climate change. Third, we investigate public trust in experts, including economists. This study aims to provide insights into climate attitudes, policy preferences, and effective communication strategies in oil-dependent economies, which are often expected to resist a swift energy transition.
