abstract: "We investigate the effects of automation on the behavior of firms that provide firm-based training. We survey companies in Switzerland that provide firm-based training – namely apprenticeships – and present them hypothetical scenarios about future work task automation. We analyze how this affects their decision regarding the number of apprenticeships they offer. Specifically, we hypothesize that the shorter time until task automation happens and the higher the proportion of tasks that are automated, the larger the reduction in apprenticeship-positions offered. Crucial to our analysis is the heterogeneity of in the firms' reactions. For this, we divide firms according to profit and investment motif with regards to offering apprenticeships, their exposure to recent innovations in AI versus previous innovations, and their size; and we divide the apprenticeship occupations into cognitive or manual as well as having high language or math requirements."
