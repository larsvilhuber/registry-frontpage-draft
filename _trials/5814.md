abstract: "This document describes the pre-analysis plan for a randomized impact evaluation of a World Bank funded, labor-intensive public works (LIPW) program in Eastern DRC. The project, implemented by the Social Fund of DRC, sought to increase resilience and livelihoods in five major cities in Eastern DRC by offering short-term employment to the urban poor. In order to make a lasting impact, the project also offered a savings incentive and a training program to develop professional skills. Between November 2016 and December 2018, 2,775 beneficiaries were randomly assigned into one of four groups. A first group of beneficiaries was offered short-term employment. A second group was offered a savings incentive in addition to the temporary works component. A third group was offered the employment component in addition to a training program while a fourth group was offered all three program activities. The impact evaluation seeks to produce rigorous evidence on non-material impacts of these four LIPW schemes. Because these schemes entered a broader program seeking stabilization and recovery of Eastern DRC, this study will investigate their impact on areas of social and political engagement, exposure to and engagement into violence, views and behaviors regarding gender equality and psychological well-being. This document provides an overview of the interventions and hypothesized effects, describes the key outcomes of interest and outlines econometric methods that will be employed to ascertain the effects of the interventions.
