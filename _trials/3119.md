abstract: "We conduct a lab-in-the field-experiment in which we randomly assign students in their last year of secondary education to watch aspirational videos that show potential role models. After being exposed to these videos, the students perform an effort task under different payment schemes which serves to assess their performance in competitive environments as well as their preference to enter into competition. There is empirical evidence that videos which display successful peers can increase individual aspirations. Showing aspirational videos could provide students with a new sense on what they could achieve, making them more ambitious (increasing their performance) and competitive (selecting more into competition). The potential role model effect can be larger for women, owing to the fact that women in the study region continue education and follow a career less often than men.

Furthermore, we will test with an artefactual field experiment whether aspirational videos also have real-world consequences in the decisions of the students to enter into competition or not. The same students from the lab-in-the-field experiment will be informed about two job openings in the project of one of the principal investigators. The students will have the opportunity to express their interest of applying to the job after the lab-in-the-field experiment. One week later, students who expressed their interest will have to fill out an application form. For the second part of this study, we include two treatments in each of the three treatment arms mentioned above. We randomly assign students to give their statement of interest in applying for the job privately or publicly. Showing a potential female role model might lead to more females expressing their interest in the job publicly, as it might decrease their discomfort from not adhering to gender norms."
