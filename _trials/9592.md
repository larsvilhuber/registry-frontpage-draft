abstract: "This randomized experiment examines how individuals perceive discrimination under three job assignment mechanisms (with varying potential to discriminate) and the effects of the two mechanisms that reduce the scope for discrimination from the status quo on perceived discrimination, retention, effort, performance, cooperation with and reciprocity towards managers, and future labor supply. The study design and randomization ensure that the only differences between the three groups is what they believe about the job assignment process."
