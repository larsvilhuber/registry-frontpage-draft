abstract: "Donations are an important way to address funding shortfalls in conservation. However, few behavioural studies have tested the impact of  ‘messaging’ on conservation donations. We will conduct two types of randomized field experiments to examine the effects of information provision on donation behaviour for forest conservation. Specifically, we measure the impacts of two types of information. The first relates to funding by informing potential donors about the percentage and total amount of current donations compared to the targeted amount. The second concerns the conservation importance of the targeted forest and provides information about the high number of threatened species that live there. We will test whether those messages enhance the donation behaviour among Japanese citizens using traditional mailshot (first experiment) and advertisements on Facebook (second experiment)."
