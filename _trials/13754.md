abstract: "Intergenerational transfers, including inter vivos transfer or inheritances, are prevalent and unequal. Through a large-scale experimental study, this study investigates the fairness preference of Americans and Chinese towards unequal intergenerational wealth transfers. Participants made real distributive choices affecting two workers whose wealth differed due to merit, luck, or parental wealth transfers."
