abstract: "Parents undeniably play a pivotal role in shaping the development of their children. Besides parental investments in form of money and time, parenting style and thus the way how parents raise their children holds substantial importance for their children’s development. The causes and consequences of parenting style, however, are still understudied. To this end, we have developed a digital parenting program designed to enhance responsive parenting. We deliberately chose the digital format as it shall allow for an easy and flexible usage. To evaluate the parenting program we collaborate with around 100 preschools in Lower Franconia (Germany) and randomly assign parents to participate in the digital parenting program. Our focus lies on investigating whether  i) the digital parenting program works; in other words, whether parents make use of it and ultimately employ more responsive parenting strategies, ii) responsive parenting has positive consequences for parents, in terms of their confidence and perceived sense-of-competence in their parenting, as well as their own mental health, and iii) responsive parenting has positive consequences for children’s development, in a first instance in terms of children’s social-cognitive and behavioral development.
