abstract: "Admission to high schools in Germany is conditional on the final grades obtained by students in junior high school. This is why thousands of 10th graders apply for admission every year. Running a randomized controlled trial in this process, we test if gender, migration background and grades have an effect on high school admission’s responsiveness to messages sent by putatively 16-year-olds teenagers who request information on the admission process. In line with our priors from a pre-test in the state of North Rhine-Westfalia, we expect that high schools across Germany discriminate against the ethnic background of students. Most notably non-German female students receive significantly fewer replies even if they have best grades."
