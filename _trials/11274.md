abstract: "Financial and agricultural technologies could help women farmers in Nigeria to build their resilience to shocks. Among the most promising of the agricultural  innovations are stress-tolerant crop varieties, an improved maize developed by the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA) through the Stress Tolerant Maize for Africa (STMA) project. These seed varieties have proven to sustain yields during moderate mid-season drought. Financial technologies such as financial literacy, Area yield index insurance  build resilience by providing financial literacy and payments in the event of insured losses. Index insurance bases payouts on an index of factors, such as rainfall or vegetation growth, that predict crop losses in an area. Because this type of insurance does not require a direct verification of losses, it can be made available at a much lower cost than conventional insurance and cost-effectively scaled across dispersed rural communities. On their own, these two innovations separately may not adequately promote resilience among farmers, particularly women. It is important to build our understanding of how to integrate these two technologies into comprehensive solutions to manage weather-related risk and how they might be tailored to meet the different needs and attitudes of women and men. Hence The University of Ilorin (UNILORIN), is committed to rigorously testing the interlinked effort of financial services, insurance,  and use of stress tolerant  seeds that will help build resilience among smallholder women farmers in Nigeria. Our primary null hypotheses are that: (1)There is no significant difference in access to financial services, stress tolerant  seeds and formal insurance among men and women smallholder farmers. (2) There is no significant effect of adoption of stress tolerant maize on  productivity of men and women smallholder farmers; (3) There is no significant effect of financial literacy, insurance and stress tolerant maize seed on the resilience of men and women smallholder farmers.
The Stress Tolerant Maize (STM) group in University of Ilorin and Accelerating Genetic Gains in Maize and Wheat for Improved Livelihoods project (AGG) of IITA project will provides logistic support for the research. The research will use STM and AGG interventions as laboratories for assessing the impact of interlinking of insurance and financial services with stress tolerant seeds in building resilience among women smallholders in Nigeria. The research partners are National Agricultural insurance Corporation (NAIC) in Nigeria and Shine  Initiative for Empowerment of Rural Dwellers, division of Arise Microfinance Bank.
