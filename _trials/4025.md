abstract: "Globally, women’s groups have emerged as an important platform for improving the economic, political and social empowerment of poor women. In India too, women’s groups have become a central component of many rural development interventions. At present, self-help groups (SHGs) are the most common variant of these women’s groups in India. A typical SHG is essentially a savings and credit group, consisting of 10-12 women who live in close proximity and meet regularly to deposit money into a collective account from which individual loans are provided to those in need (Nair 2005). These groups are widespread: the National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) covers over 5 million households, and the Bihar Rural Livelihoods Support Program (BRLPS) reaches another 9 million under the JEEViKA program.

In recent years, multiple thematic interventions - on agriculture and livelihoods, WASH, health and nutrition and political action - have been layered onto these community platforms. These community-based interventions are largely delivered by agents selected from within the communities they serve. An example of this would be the JEEViKA Technical Support Program, a partnership between the BRLPS and Project Concern International, currently implemented in over a hundred blocks of Bihar. Even without the thematic additions, it has been shown that SHGs have the potential to empower women socially, politically and financially; this, combined with their reach and penetration, makes them a powerful development platform.

In India, evidence suggests that SHGs are generally ethnically and economically homogenous - partly due to self-selection into groups, partly deliberately, because it is believed that homogeneity improves cohesion, and partly because villages tend to be divided into ethnically homogeneous hamlets, so women living close to one another are typically of the same ethnicity. This implies that development programs that use SHGs as a vehicle for advancing interventions in agriculture, health, nutrition, or other areas may be susceptible to limitations imposed by society’s ethnic conventions, such as the exclusion of “lower” castes from certain occupations, public spaces or public goods. This is particularly salient in a state like Bihar, where caste divisions are stark. 

We propose a field experiment to examine how the relationship between the ethnic identity of the development agent and that of SHG members affects the delivery and acceptability of development interventions. We test this using the provision of information on the need to invest in nutrition-related public goods. Specifically, we design a model of a group-based community nursery and kitchen garden that requires the investment of labour hours by members of the SHG. We then test the impact of (1) information around the importance of dietary diversity in improving maternal and child nutrition, and (2) the ethnic identity of the agent providing that information relative to the group, on the willingness of group members to contribute labour hours towards the construction of the group-specific public good. We will conduct the study in close collaboration with PRADAN, an Indian NGO with many years of experience in this sector.
