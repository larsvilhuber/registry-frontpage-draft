abstract: "Large language models (LLMs), the most well-known form of generative artificial intelligence, have proven remarkably useful in the Finance domain. Thus far, studies on the capabilities of LLMs in financial applications have investigated general-purpose models (mostly drawing on OpenAI's cutting-edge GPT models) without domain-specific knowledge (i.e., Finance-specific knowledge). It stands to reason that the performance of LLMs could be further enhanced by adding domain-specific knowledge to pre-trained LLMs. Thus, we study how injecting domain-specific knowledge affects the performance of LLMs in a simple portfolio allocation task. We vary the type and scope of domain-specific information we inject and compare the performance across treatment conditions and to a human benchmark derived from an incentivized survey among financial advisors.
