abstract: "Cause marketing (CM) refers to the practice of linking consumer goods with charities or “causes”. It is a very common practice for increasing sales and loyalty of products. There is an extensive literature on the extent to which charitable donations are motivated by pure altruism and warm glow. In this study, we will explore altruistic preferences of individuals when they purchase goods that are associated with charitable giving. We introduce a theoretical model and an experimental design to study the giving motivations of individual in a charitable giving framework that accommodates cause marketing. CM is also used as a tool to increase total amount of donations to a certain charity or for a particular cause. We will use our model and experiment to show that an increase in total donations will occur only for certain preference types. In particular, individuals who do not view direct donations and donations from cause-marketing as perfect substitutes and get more utility from direct givings are behind a surge in total charitable output."
