abstract: "This trial tested the effect on the subject choices of secondary school students in English schools of providing them with information about the variation in graduate salaries by undergraduate subject studied. We ran a cluster randomised controlled trial in 2011-12 in which 15-16 year old students were provided with information about graduate salaries through an activity-based lesson lasting one hour. The lesson was taught by the normal class teacher using resources provided for the intervention. The information on graduate salaries was taken from a study by O'Leary and Sloane (2011) which used data from the Labour Force Survey. The education system in England encourages relatively early specialization. Most students who remain in full-time education between the ages of 16 and 18 study a small (3-5) number of subjects which are designed to prepare for undergraduate study. Undergraduates typically study their major from their freshman year onwards. We measured the effect of the intervention on students' choice of subject using the records supplied by the school showing which subjects students were studying in 2012/13 when the students were aged between 16 and 17. Data were collected by questionnaires before and after the intervention lesson. These data were linked to data available on the National Pupil Database. We were therefore able to control for a range of student characteristics including prior achievement, parental education, ethnicity, cultural capital and expressed intentions towards subjects they might study. 

A priori we conducted a power calculation assuming an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.1 and an average school size of 83, which suggested that 48 schools would give 80% power to detect a 0.3 difference in outcomes using a two-tailed test at α=0.05. We generated a pool of potential participants through a list of all schools within a large and diverse geographical area within England which satisfied our criteria: serving the age range 13-18 and having at least 100 students in their ‘sixth forms’ (students in the academic year for students aged 16-17 and the academic year for students aged 17-18). We also stratified our sample to include 20 private schools and 30 state schools. These criteria meant that the average achievement of students in our sample was significantly higher than the average for all 15-16 year-old students in England. Schools satisfying these criteria were placed in a random order and approached in that order until we had secured firm agreement for participation. The total project sample included 50 schools and 5,593 students. Ten schools withdrew part way through the project. Six schools (571 students) allocated to the intervention arm did not take part in the intervention and four schools (487 students) allocated to the control did not take part in the questionnaire administered after the intervention. As per the recommendations for reporting randomised trials (Moher et al. 2001) we report results using an intention to treat analysis. We used the mi routines in Stata to impute missing data. 

Analysis of the trial data showed a positive effect on choosing to study math and a negative effect on choosing study biology or art.
