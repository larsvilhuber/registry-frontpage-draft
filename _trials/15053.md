abstract: "The Educational Innovation Project (EIP) in El Salvador, funded by USAID and implemented by FHI 360, aims to improve foundational learning outcomes by enhancing teacher professional development and school management. This randomized controlled trial evaluates the impact of two interventions: (1) a comprehensive teacher training program integrating targeted instruction, socio-emotional learning, and ICT-based teaching strategies, and (2) a focused arm on targeted instruction. The study examines outcomes related to student learning in literacy and numeracy, teaching practices, and school management effectiveness. "
