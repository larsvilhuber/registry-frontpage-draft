abstract: "The stage of this RCT is Glassdoor, which is a crowd-sourced platform where people anonymously post firm reviews. Glassdoor has a "flag" function which allow users to report the reviews that are against Glassdoor's terms of service.

This study aims to find out whether the processing time of these reviews is faster for newer reviews."
