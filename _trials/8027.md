abstract: "This study conducts a filed experiment that explore how to improve the academic achievement and non-cognitive ability of left-behind children. We examine the video calling intervention and after-school tutoring intervention in our experiment.
We designed two different type of intervention programs: Video-calling program as academic and After-class tutoring program as academic intervention, which were targeted at children from 3rd grades to 5th grades in primary school. Moreover, with video-calling and after-school tutoring intervention, we endeavour to compare average treatment effect of two different interventions and expect to see improvement both in academic achievement and Big-five personality of left-behind children."
