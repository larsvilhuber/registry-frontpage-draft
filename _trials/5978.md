abstract: "This study aims to use an online experiment on an Indian matrimonial website to assess the prevalence, and extent, of discrimination against working, career and higher-income earning women in the marriage market in India. The experiment will help gauge the impact of women's work, especially their desire to work after marriage and their relative income on potential marriage market outcomes, in terms of the responsiveness and interest from male suitors.
