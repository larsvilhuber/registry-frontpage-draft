abstract: "Through the delivery of comprehensive football for development training and the involvement of school students, this program is reaching out and educating young people in countries with identified need, on what it takes to be truly inclusive. Out on these pitches, football plays an important role in making teammates of people from different backgrounds. The program has 10-12 sessions delivered as Physical Education class for school students aged 8-12 years. During the delivery of the program, coaches and PE teachers confront the issue of commitment and engagement of participants in the program, which hinders the learning process. The objective of the study is to test whether signing a commitment card with a set of rules, such as following instructions and wearing sports outfit, can increase studentsâ€™ commitment to the program, compared to students that will not be asked to sign the commitment card."
