abstract: "This study focuses on perceptions and normative evaluations of richness, an understudied aspect of inequality. It uses a vignette experiment to assess the effects of the origin of money, use of money and amount of money on normative evaluations of the rich. It will thus assess perceptions of their deservingness. 
The results will add to the literature on perceptions of inequality and deservingness, where we know much more about perceptions of the poor than the rich. Further, this module contributes to research on attitudes towards redistributive policies. Research on perceptions towards the poor expects that when people perceive the poor as undeserving, they are less likely to support pro-poor redistribution. Our module will allow us to evaluate whether people who perceive the rich as deserving are less likely to support redistribution by taxing the rich.
