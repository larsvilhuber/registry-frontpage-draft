abstract: "Algorithmic decision support tools used in high-stakes domains such as criminal justice, hiring, and lending often exclude protected variables from input data to comply with anti-discrimination regulations and fairness principles. While these interventions are typically assessed based on quantitative disparity measures, their behavioral implications are less explored. This experiment examines how human decision makers, who are assisted by these tools in making accurate decisions about others, respond to algorithmic predictions that omit protected group membership, and whether these reactions are related to their prior statistical beliefs about protected groups. It examines how such interventions affect belief updating, and how this in turn affects discrimination in subsequent decision outcomes.

The experiment uses a hiring context in which participants predict the performance of individual workers on a math and science quiz, both before and after receiving algorithmic performance predictions for each worker. The workers are selected to be balanced by gender, with otherwise identical characteristics, allowing for the measurement of prior statistical beliefs about gender differences in quiz performance. The algorithm’s input data varies between subjects regarding the inclusion of the gender variable. Participants are informed about the input data. Prediction results remain constant as gender is neither a significant predictor nor correlated with significant predictors. Another treatment excludes month of birth (even vs. odd) from the training data, while keeping gender included. By excluding a non-stereotypical variable, the experiment differentiates whether participants’ reactions are specifically driven by the omission of the gender variable, or if their behavior changes due to the exclusion of any variable."
