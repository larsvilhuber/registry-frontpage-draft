abstract: "This study is a follow-up to Ziegler et al. (2022) who found a deterioration of morals in markets where the replacement logic is available (FULL) compared to both individual decision-making and markets with capacity constraints (MULTI), and especially to study II (AEARCTR-0008306). In this study, we provide participants with information from previous sessions to shock their beliefs about the number of other traders that are active. The goal is to study the impact of shocked beliefs on trading behavior.
