abstract: "In the past two decades, 30% of U.S. voters have indicated mistrust in electoral outcomes, and the number is growing in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential elections and an increasingly polarized political landscape.  Our project seeks to utilize messaging on the bipartisan nature of the electoral processes to enhance voter confidence in U.S. election results, and evaluate whether an increase in voter confidence will lead to higher turnout for different groups of registered voters.  

We plan to conduct a randomized experiment before the midterm elections in November 2022 and match respondentsâ€™ treatment status with their voting behavior on an individual level based on the subsequent voter file data. We will analyze our treatment effects on those who voted in 2018 and those who did not, and across ideological lines. 

As the first large-scale experiment to evaluate the causal relationship between voter confidence and electoral participation, our project will contribute to research on American politics, political communication, and behavioral/experimental economics. Moreover, our findings will provide actionable insights and policy recommendations for election officials.
