abstract: "In a survey of recent visitors of an employment center in New England, we ask respondents to choose between hypothetical jobs with randomized characteristics, allowing us to quantify workers’ preferences concerning three mechanisms by which they may voice their needs or ideas to their employers: 1) a standard human resources department, 2) an “employee resource group” sponsored by management, and 3) a union with collective bargaining. We quantify how these preferences, as measured in willingness-to-pay (willingness to sacrifice wages), are modified by higher levels of monitoring by employers, and by a remote work option."
