abstract: "There is evidence that the gender of high-order school participants (teachers, principals, etc) impacts students. It remains an open question whether same-group peers can act as role models for their classmates. We develop a survey experiment in which individuals are exposed to randomized images of students of different gender excelling in different subjects. Participants are asked whether they think that the image of the student they see could provide good examples for other students in terms of performance, behavior, study and career choices.  "
