abstract: "This study will use a conjoint survey experiment to test the importance of production and process performance for political trust. The survey is fielded during the third week of school closures in Denmark (March 30th-April 6th) due to the coronavirus (covid-19). The survey experiment tests the effect of production performance outcomes (fatality rate, economic costs) and process performance outcomes (equality in health, equality in economic costs, use of cellphone data) on political trust and the respondentsâ€™ preferred choice of strategy towards the coronavirus.
