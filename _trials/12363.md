abstract: "In a laboratory experiment, we examine bidder behavior in a multi-unit single-price auction. Two units of a good are for sale. Each bidder has a randomly-determined private valuation. We contrast the behavior of one human bidder in an auction with the behavior of two human bidders. Human bidders have a demand for two units each. The presence of computer-simulated bidders with demand for one unit ensures that the total demand is equal across treatments."
