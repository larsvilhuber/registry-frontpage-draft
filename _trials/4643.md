abstract: "This study examines the effects of a high-dosage math tutoring program for low achieving 5th grade primary students in a disadvantaged neighborhood in Amsterdam (Amsterdam South-East, The Netherlands). Based on 4th grade test scores, low achieving students were eligible and about half of them were randomly selected to participate in the program. Selected students receive intensive math tutoring in a 2 (students) on 1 (tutor) setting, for 5 days/week, 45 min/day, for an entire school year. Prior to the start of the program, treated and control students scored roughly 1.2 population level standard deviations below the national average."
