abstract: "I investigate in an experimental survey, whether publicly informing individuals from disadvantaged groups that their selection for a beneficial opportunity, such as an educational program, is based on their group identity, aﬀects their perceptions of the opportunity offered. In a lab-in-the-field experiment in collaboration with a Colombian university, I present information of the international program to students from diﬀerent social groups and ask them to indicate how different social groups (females, low-middles social class, rural origins) feel about the invitation they received. Some are shown a course invitation that discloses that they would be invited to the program because of their
demographics, others are not. I focus on three measures for each social group: tokenisms, offense, judgement."
