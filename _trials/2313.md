abstract: "We conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the effectiveness of small-scale Kickstart irrigation pumps for low-income farmers. In 2015, Kickstart distributed 500 irrigation pumps to randomly selected poor rural households in Western Kenya, where an effort was made to specifically give the pump to female household members. The analysis described in this document focuses on the Intent to Treat (ITT) estimates, comparing those who received pumps to those who did not, with Treatment on the Treated (TOT) effects comparing those who actually used pumps vs. non-recipients are evaluated as a secondary outcome. The present document outlines the outcome variables and econometric methods we will use to assess the effect of the technology on agricultural income, time use, and investments in inputs along with measures of household consumption, food security, assests, income and enterprise activity, as well as  domestic violence and the psychological well-being and empowerment of female household members."
