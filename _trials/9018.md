abstract: "Female workers and entrepreneurs were randomly chosen to receive a free e-bank and savings account, 
which is only accessible to the woman. She is able to make transactions at a local bank branch or through a mobile network, 
keeping transactions as private as she would like. In addition to providing e-bank and savings accounts, 
we also experimentally varied the involvement of the husband by offering the same savings product but with their 
husbands being informed about. Finally, in some households, both spouses were invited to a training program that 
aims to improve the quality of household decision-making."
