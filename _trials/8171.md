abstract: "People's attitudes regarding the fairness of income inequality may differ depending on the source of inequality. The fairness views with respect to inequality generated by luck or by merit have been recently studied in different countries. In this study we would like to extend the discussion and examine views regarding inherited inequality in addition to the views regarding inequality generated by luck and merit.  
We conduct an incentivized online experiment consisting of a representative sample of the adult Israeli population. The experiment is based on the impartial spectator methodology (as in Almas et al., 2020) in which spectators make redistribution choices in situations where inequality is due to luck, effort or inheritance."
