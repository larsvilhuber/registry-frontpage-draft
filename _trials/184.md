abstract: "This evaluation will examine TFAâ€™s efforts to scale up their program under an Investing in Innovation (i3) grant from the U.S. Department of Education (ED). Under the scale-up initiative, TFA plans to increase the size of its teacher corps by more than 80 percent by September 2014, placing 28,000 TFA teachers in high-need classrooms. The evaluation will include an implementation analysis of the scale-up efforts as well as an analysis of the impact of the scaled-up program on student achievement at the elementary school level. The impact analysis will be based on an experimental design, under which students in a given school and grade will be randomly assigned to a class taught by a TFA teacher or a class taught by a non-TFA teacher. Information on program implementation will be collected from interviews with TFA staff and TFA-collected data on both successful and unsuccessful applicants to its program. Data on student achievement for the impact analysis will be obtained from a study-administered assessment for students in grades kindergarten through 2 and from state or district records for students in grades 3 through 5. We will also survey teachers in the impact analysis sample on their backgrounds, attitudes, and classroom practices."
