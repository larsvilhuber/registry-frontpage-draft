abstract: "This research studies a government multifaceted program implemented in urban Madagascar. It compares a simple cash transfer program (Transferts monétaires urbains, TMU) to the multifaceted version of the program. The multifaceted TMU adds a productive cash grant component to the regular cash transfers provided by the classic TMU program. The multifaceted TMU also provides additional support to Community Saving and Loan Associations (CSLA) aimed at promoting beneficiary income-generating activities. The multifaceted version of the program was randomly provided to a subset of the TMU neighborhoods (fokontany) by the government. This selection process generates a randomized control trial (RCT) design. We will measure the short term impact of the productive package provided by the multifaceted TMU program (compared to the classic TMU program) on household productive activities and wellbeing."
