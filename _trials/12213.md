abstract: "Previous research has provided evidence that feedback in the form of relative performance information (RPI) can increase employees’ performance. However, it is very likely that the strength of the performance effects resulting from such a feedback depends on the feedback recipient’s personality traits and prior performance (e.g., whether the feedback is positive or negative). In this study, we aim to investigate whether machine learning can enhance the effects of RPI by tailoring it to an employee's individual characteristics. Additionally, we will utilize both closed-form and open-ended questions to target RPI and explore the use of alternative data sources."
