abstract: "This study analyzes the impact of a comprehensive technology project in Brazilian public schools. This project is the first structured initiative with the objective of fostering the adoption of technology within a larger policy, the “Connected Education Program.” This initiative – called Public Call for the Connected Education Program – provides additional funds for a group of randomly selected schools to implement the program. These additional funds are at least 300% higher than what this group of schools was receiving from other sources to implement technology projects. The Connected Education Program was developed under the premise that the potential of technology in education is only achieved by integrating four dimensions – vision, infrastructure, expertise and content – which must be in balance. This study focuses on two key research questions. First, does the “Public Call for the Connected Education Program” lead to an improvement in student learning? Second, what are the mechanisms of change? We will conduct a randomized controlled trial within the municipalities selected to receive the intervention. Our study is designed as a matched-pair cluster randomization with three levels (municipalities, schools and students) and treatment at level two (schools). Within the municipalities selected to receive support we have randomized 50% of the municipal schools to receive the treatment. Within the schools, we will evaluate school, teachers and students’ outcomes. The evaluation will focus on students of the 5th grade municipal schools. Our key hypothesis is that the interaction between the four dimensions is what will generate the intervention’s impact."
