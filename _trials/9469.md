abstract: "In real life, people face strategic situations when there are trade-offs between payoff maximization and sequential reasoning. The decision we made in these situations depends on our own strategic reasoning, and the advice we received from others. In this project, we will examine the situation when this advice is generated by an algorithm. Furthermore, we will explore the mechanism behind algorithm trust in strategic interactions."
