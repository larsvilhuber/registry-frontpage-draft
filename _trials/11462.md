abstract: "The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) currently has a Best Practice Guide for International Money Transfer (IMT) calculators. However, evidence suggests that online calculators may still be confusing for users. 
This research will test a number of potential changes to IMT calculators. These changes are designed to improve the communication of fees and exchange rate margins with users. These changes should allow consumers to directly compare IMT services with each other, which will improve competition and ultimately improve value to consumers. 
Findings from this research may inform updates to the ACCC Best Practice Guide."
