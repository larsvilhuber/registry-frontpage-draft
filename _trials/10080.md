abstract: "Using data from a new small-scale survey ran under a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) framework, I measure the differences in treatment effects that come from different FOMC statements that express the same message, only changing the level of complexity in the choice of words used. The three treatments are based on the actual FOMC statement from December 15, 2021, and express the same message; however, the first treatment (T1) expresses the message with simplified language, and the third treatment (T3) with complex language. The second treatment (T2) is the actual FOMC statement.

I am consequently able to look at how the general public, a non-specialized audience, reacts to distinct policy statements that only differ in the complexity of the words used. For this audience, a simpler message is more effective in shaping householdsâ€™ expectations and enhancing understanding, but less effective in stimulating trust in the central bank."
