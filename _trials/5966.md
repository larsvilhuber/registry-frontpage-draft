abstract: "In this project, we investigate whether support for federalism depends on peopleâ€™s perception of policy heterogeneity across states. In particular, we study the decentralization of education policy across states of Germany, focusing on the minimum number of hours students are mandated to attend in primary school. We implement an online-survey experiment among a representative sample of adults aged 18 to 69 years in Germany. Each subject is randomly assigned to one of four experimental groups, and completes three consecutive stages. In stage 1 all respondents are asked to guess how many primary-school hours are mandatory (i) in Germany, (ii) in their state, (iii) in the state with the fewest required hours and (iv) in the state with the most required hours. In stage 2 all respondents state how many hours they think primary school should be mandated to attend on average. In stage 3 a randomly selected group receives information on the mandatory hours of primary students in Germany and in their state. A second group additionally receives information on the mandatory hours in the states with the highest and lowest number of required hours. A third group is identical to group 1, but receives additional information on the mandatory hours in a randomly drawn other state. The fourth group of respondents does not receive any additional information. All respondents then state their support for decentralization of education policy. "
