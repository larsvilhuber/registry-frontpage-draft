abstract: "Whether the observed association between aflatoxin exposure and stunting in children is causal, and how exposure to this toxin can be mitigated, are open questions. This study comprises a three-arm randomized controlled trial designed to answer both questions. Within 71 randomly selected maize-growing villages of Meru and Tharaka-Nithi counties of Kenya, households that included a pregnant woman or child under 2 years of age were recruited. Villages were randomly assigned to, a post-harvest technology intervention group, an exposure reduction intervention group, or a comparison group. Within the post-harvest group, prices for an aflatoxin mitigation technology were randomly varied across households, as was the opportunity to receive a price incentive for safe stored maize. Primary outcomes in the post-harvest technology sub-study are adoption of the technology and aflatoxin levels in stored maize.  Primary outcomes in the exposure reduction sub-study are blood aflatoxin levels in children and child linear growth (LAZ). "
