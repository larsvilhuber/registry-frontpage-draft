abstract: "Recent findings show that people care about the negative consequences their choices unfold on others. They often incur moral costs as they trade-off selfish motives against ethical concerns. However, these intrinsic costs are far from being steadfast and people often exploit moral wiggle room to justify selfish behavior in morally questionable situations. In this paper, we want to examine how employees react to the introduction of unethical but payoff-beneficial production externalities across different workplace settings. In our lab experiment, participants have the possibility to generate personal income for themselves by decoding letters in a simple real effort task. The explicit task compensation depends on the implemented production type. They either work under a high wage or under a low wage scheme. Working under the high wage, however, adversely affects the income of a passive third party. In particular, we are interested in whether employees justify selfish behavior (maximizing personal income under the production externality) across different workplace scenarios using a 2x2-treatment design.
