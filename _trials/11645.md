abstract: "The study design is a randomized control trial that compares the reading proficiency outcomes of students who receive Chapter One’s 1:1 tutoring support from a certified teacher Early Learning Interventionists (“ELIs”) to students who receive tutoring support from a non-teacher ELIs. Chapter One’s certified teacher ELIs undergo rigorous training program on phonics and literacy instruction. The tutoring began in August 2022 in 7 schools and 54 kindergarten, first, and second grade classrooms that constitute the study sites. As part of the tutoring program, Chapter One’s Reading Foundation Stage (RFS) and Oral Reading Fluency (ORF) assessments are administered by ELIs at the beginning, middle, and end of school year to all 1,129 tutored students in the participating classrooms.  Approximately half of the students in each classroom are randomly assigned to receive tutoring from a certified teacher ELIs (treatment group, N=583) and approximately half of the students were assigned to receive tutoring from a non-teacher ELIs (control group, N=546).
