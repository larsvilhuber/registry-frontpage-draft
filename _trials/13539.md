abstract: "This trial protocol summarises the approach for the first Utilisation Payments mini-trial within CrowdFlex: Beta. 
A trial protocol for the first Availability Payments mini-trial and all subsequent mini-trials will come later in 2024. 
CrowdFlex will take an iterative and learning approach, altering the treatments in later mini-trials. 
For the first utilisation mini-trial, we will be testing how different incentives (Â£ per kWh flexibility) cause domestic customers to turn-down or up their energy consumption during event windows. 
Each Demand Side Response Service Provider (DSRSP) will have four groups (n=9,600 per group) exposed to different payment levels, and a fifth waitlisted group that will serve as a control group"
