abstract: "In this project I study how immigration and economic information shocks affect political preferences. After viewing a projection of either future immigration or job automation, subjects are asked to choose between fictional political candidates. The candidates' social background, stances on immigration and redistribution are cross-randomized. This allows me to study whether (1) immigration and economic shocks change subjects' choice over political candidates, and (2) whether the change can be attributed to social background or preferred policy."
