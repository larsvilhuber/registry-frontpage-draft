abstract: "Covid-19 is a worldwide pandemic. Some medical studies suggest that contracting Covid-19 increases the risk of developing other health problems. However, there is significant ambiguity about the severity of sequelae. In the Chinese insurance industry, we observe that some insurance companies charge higher premiums or even refuse to provide coverage to people infected with Covid-19. We conjecture that insurers' willingness to cover is influenced by their ambiguity attitudes and perceived ambiguity about the severity of sequelae. In this study, we use questionnaires to investigate individuals' risk perceptions on Covid-19 and attitudes toward insurers' underwriting decisions. We recruit two types of respondents including insurance professionals and lay people. Their levels of knowledge of risk differ considerably, which may lead to different opinions. In the questionnaires, we use some self-reported attitudinal scales to measure individuals' willingness for coverage, ambiguity and pro-sociality preferences. We conjecture that the more averse insurance professionals are to ambiguity, the less willing they are to cover people infected with Covid-19. Conversely, the more averse lay people are to ambiguity, the more they expect insurers to cover Covid-19. Moreover, respondents with a higher level of pro-sociality are more willing to cover people infected with Covid-19."
