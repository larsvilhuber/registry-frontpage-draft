abstract: "Our study will examine how branding influences stakeholder engagement with government services and alternative solutions. Specifically, in the realm of policing and its alternatives, we plan to carry out an email experiment to distribute findings from previous research to key policymakers and civic leaders. Our aim is to gauge their interest in these results and their readiness to incorporate alternative public safety strategies into their community's governance framework."
