abstract: "FORSA is a new program of the Egyptian government implemented by the Ministry of Social Solidarity which aims to graduate beneficiaries of the national cash transfer program "Takaful" to self-reliance.  The program has two modalities: (1) an asset-transfer modality which is inspired by the BRAC graduation model approach and (2) a wage employment modality which focuses on job matching and training.  Both modalities also include a behavioral change seminar intended to increase self-efficacy, financial literacy training, and ongoing mentoring provided by volunteers.  A pilot funded by the World Bank is planned in 165 communities including 50,000 participants.
We will conduct a cluster randomized control trial of this pilot program to measure the impact and cost-effectiveness of the two approaches at raising wage and self-employment income and increasing consumption for participants and explore heterogenous effects by poverty level, match between actual and desired modality, and other baseline characteristics.   The program activities are expected to last 12-18 months, from late 2021 to early 2023. We plan to collect baseline data in August 2021 prior to the intervention and follow-up data in August 2023.   Because there is expected to be a high degree of self-selection into the program and into the separate modalities, our household sample will be based on a model of predicted participation conditional on administrative data on Takaful beneficiaries.   This model will be trained using a separate sample of households for which uptake information is available prior to the baseline. 
Our evaluation will complement a rich existing literature by exploring how the graduation model works when targeted to beneficiaries at various levels of poverty and when implemented at scale by a government.   The asset-transfer modality will provide an example of an at-scale graduation program which provides an asset-transfer, training, savings group, and health messaging, but instead of investing in staff for weekly mentoring, will provide messaging and guidance through existing government structures.   The wage employment modality will be primarily a job matching service with subsidized on-the-job training.  A unique feature of the Forsa intervention is that it will also work with employers to improve job quality and work environments, responding to high turnover among workers.
