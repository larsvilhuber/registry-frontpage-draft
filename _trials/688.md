abstract: "The project assess the effects of voter information on vote buying and incumbent advantage. The intervention was designed with and implemented by the Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV). We collected data from candidates on their proposed policies and platforms and distributed that information in brochures to voters in randomly selected villages ahead of the May 13, 2013 mayoral elections in the Philippines. These brochures and the household visits by PPCRV volunteers to distribute and explain the brochures increased voter information about the types of public good provision that mayors could provide and to inform them of the availability of a large fund to finance provision of municipal public goods.

The intervention (and pre-analysis plan) were registered on the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) hypothesis registry on May 12, 2013."
