abstract: "Indonesian women’s labor market participation has remained relatively constant with around 50% of women working. Previous research has shown that women’s economic participation is hindered by marriage and childcare responsibilities. The reluctance of women to work when they are married and have young children is likely due to social norms that emphasize the role of women as mothers and carers. While the role of social norms is widely acknowledged, there is very limited research on social norms around women working in Indonesia. This research therefore aims to evaluate online information interventions designed to influence men’s and women’s attitudes towards women’s labor force participation. "
