abstract: "The study investigates the relationship between informal support among individuals, in the 
form of a risk-sharing strategy, and the presence of formal insurance in a lab-in-the field 
experiment. According to the existing literature, the introduction of formal insurance in a 
community is associated with a reduction of the informal support the individuals can rely on, 
in terms of monetary transfers from one to each other. We propose a lab-in-the-field experiment 
that consists of a repeated dictator game, allowing to investigate if formal insurance not just 
decreases informal support but also improves the overall coverage from idiosyncratic shocks. 
Furthermore, in the experiment we have designed, we construct a situation where the crowding-out of informal support among players, conditioned to the presence of insurance, may be less 
prominent. Specifically, when individuals are engaged in a reciprocity mechanism as a risk-sharing strategy, the introduction of formal insurance might decrease informal support less due 
to the presence of established self-enforcing mutual help relationships. "
