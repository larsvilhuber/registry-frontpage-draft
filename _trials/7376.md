abstract: "In this study we evaluate the effects of Think Equalâ€™s curriculum which provides socio-emotional education to children aged 3-6.

Socio-emotional skills play a major role in driving important life outcomes and influencing the development of cognitive skills (OECD, 2017) and labor market success (Heckman & Kautz, 2012). In fact, existing experimental evidence on socio-emotional learning reveals long-term positive effects in youth. Most of the interventions for children usually have an integrated approach that includes health, nutrition, cognitive development and protection services. However, there is scarce experimental evidence on the impact of early childhood programs focusing mainly on socio-emotional skills.

This program uses the existing infrastructure and resources of the Colombian family welfare institute (ICBF) that serves 1.7 million vulnerable children and their families nationwide. This will facilitate the scalability of the intervention if the program seems effective in this context. IPA is implementing a cluster randomized control trial (RCT) in 366 public community nurseries (HCBs) in Colombia.""
