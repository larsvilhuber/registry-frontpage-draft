abstract: "Teacher quality is one of the key determinants of students’ academic success. We examine the impact of teacher screening criteria on academic outcomes of primary school students to better hire effective teachers. Specifically, we consider two different traits of a teacher that can potentially improve academic outcomes: 1) a teacher candidate’s math test score and 2) his/her performance on a teaching demonstration. Our study takes place in the context of the after school teacher recruitment drive in rural Malawi by our collaborating NGO, Africa Future Foundation (AFF). During the pre-employment testing session, AFF conducted the math test and teaching demonstration for 347 teacher applicants. Then, AFF randomly divided them into two groups: “math test” and “teaching demonstration” group.  132 out of 173 in the math test group were hired based on their math test score as after school teachers. 130 out of 174 in the teaching demonstration group were hired based on their teaching demonstration evaluation. Hired teachers were randomly assigned to 414 classes in 31 schools, with 122 classes comprising of 4-7th graders. A class size of 4, 6, 8, or 10 was randomly determined for each tutoring class. We compare the performance of teachers (students’ test score) selected via two different channels over one year (three semesters) to shed light on effective teacher screening."
