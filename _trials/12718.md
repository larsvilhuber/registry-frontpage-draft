abstract: "The judicial system frequently falls short of its claimed standard of impartiality, instead perpetuating racial and gender biases. While these shortcomings are well documented, their origins are less well understood. To get a better understanding of the emergence of these biases, we take a step back from the judicial system and focus on law students instead. 
We conduct a randomized control trial (RCT) in the introductory lecture of criminal law by randomizing a characteristic feature of the perpetrator in the final exam and analyzing the response behavior of the students. Thereby, we can determine whether biases are already observed in students starting law school. In follow-up projects we further aim to track the development of the biases throughout law school. "
