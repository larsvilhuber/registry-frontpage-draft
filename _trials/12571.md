abstract: "We study how (miscalibrated) beliefs about one’s ability causally affect optimal actions through (misguided) inferences about an external fundamental. Our experimental paradigm ensures that the causal impact of beliefs on effort solely operates through inferences about an external fundamental to eliminate any motivational confounds arising from learning about one’s ability."
