abstract: "The objective of this evaluation is to use a randomized design to evaluate the effect of sending a series of mobile SMS follow-ups to beneficiaries who have received referrals for family planning services from a family planning promoter in urban and peri-urban Mozambique (Nampula and Sofala provinces). Currently, only about 50% of beneficiaries who receive referrals ever redeem them by visiting a family planning clinic. This evaluation seeks to understand whether behaviorally informed SMS messages can be a cost-effective means of increasing the referral redemption rate among beneficiaries. The project is implemented by the Office of Evaluation Sciences, supporting the USAID-funded Integrated Family Planning Program (IFPP) in Mozambique led by Pathfinder International; the component of the IFPP that will be evaluated in this project is led by Population Services International (PSI)."
