abstract: "A “digital divide” exists in access to technology and internet connectivity. Policymakers argue that this divide impedes lower-income and minority students’ ability to complete schoolwork and succeed academically. Government agencies and private entities have directed large investments toward bridging the digital divide in the hopes of reducing achievement disparities across socio-economic groups. However, there have been no large-scale experiments testing whether access to the internet improves student achievement. This study identifies the causal effect of bridging the digital divide on student achievement by randomizing the provision of 10,000 smart phones, tablets and hot spots, with 4-year data plans, to high school students who lack home internet access. This project is a part of a larger initiative, the 1Million Project (1MP), which provides devices and data plans to one million high school students across the country. This study will inform policies that aim to provide digital devices and internet access to low-income students. "
