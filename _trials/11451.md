abstract: "This paper investigates the behavioral impact of mobility, self-confidence, and entitlement in the context of the prospect of upward mobility (POUM). It has been found that the rates of antisocial behavior occur more frequently when mobility is not possible and that a mobility process determined by effort rather than luck decreases the antisocial behavior rates. What is unclear is whether these findings can be expanded to a setting in which subjects do not experience any income mobility but are able to form expectations about future mobility and when mobility applies in all directions. With this regard, I designed an experiment where subjects can reduce others’ payoffs at a cost, knowing that in the future they can move in the income distribution in all directions. The mobility process is endogenously modified by individuals’ relative performances or luck, and it is characterized by the POUM effect or not based on performances or luck. It has a certain and uncertain part, with the uncertain part being dependent on the experiment’s outcomes. Individuals chose whether to attack or not another subject in three different cases. First, there was no future mobility. Second, decisions were taken knowing that there was future mobility and estimating the unknown part of the mobility function through expectations of subjects’ relative performance or luck, introducing the self-confidence or optimism effect. Finally, subjects made choices knowing that there was future mobility and their actual mobility function, introducing the entitlement effect across treatments. Other determinants that can affect results, such as risk aversion and individual characteristics, are controlled through a specific test and a questionnaire."
