abstract: "The standard economic model of crime predicts that people lie more when material incentives are higher. Yet, most experimental studies find no effect of monetary incentives on dishonesty. In most existing studies, changes of payoffs are implemented by multiplying honest and dishonest payoffs by a certain factor. An explanation for the lacking effect could be that it becomes not only more profitable to be dishonest but also to be honest. The goal of our research is to examine the importance of the absolute and relative difference of payoffs for dishonesty in an online study. Subjects participate in a wheel of fortune game in which they can increase their payoff by lying. Our treatments vary the absolute and the relative difference in payoffs."
