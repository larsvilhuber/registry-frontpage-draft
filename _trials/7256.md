abstract: "We study the competition for consumer attention between social media platforms. We run a field experiment that collects comprehensive data on the time usage of individuals as well as periodically collects psychological measures of well-being. We randomize restrictions to several prominent social media applications on subject's phones and utilize this to measure changes in subject's well-being and time usage. This randomization allows us to overcome a primary challenge with measuring substitution patterns in such markets where firms compete for consumer attention and are characterized by zero monetary prices. We utilize our experiment to characterize such substitution patterns, define relevant markets, and estimate a demand system for consumer attention. "
