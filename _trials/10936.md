abstract: "The project involves the implementation and evaluation of an intervention that empowers youth groups (including both girls and boys in the age range 16-25) to tackle the problem of female early marriage within their communities through paralegal training and mentoring and supervision by experienced paralegals. The aim of the intervention is to reduce female early marriage and school dropout, and improve agency of adolescent girls and young women in Bangladesh. Compared to existing programmes, the main innovation lies in institutionalising moral agency by building paralegal capabilities through grassroots youth network development."
