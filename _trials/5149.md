abstract: "Attitudes towards social groups such as women and racial minorities are important determinants of decision-making, but they are difficult to measure for individuals in policy-making roles. We propose to address this challenge by studying U.S. appellate court judges, for whom we have large corpora of written text (their published opinions). Using published opinions, we construct a judge-specific measure of gender-stereotyped language (gender slant) by looking at the linguistic association of words identifying gender (male versus female) and words identifying gender stereotypes (career versus family). To improve our understanding of how lexical slant can be interpreted, we plan to conduct an online survey experiment aimed at eliciting gender preferences from judges with the objective of correlating them with our measure of lexical slant.
