abstract: "This paper seeks to estimate the impact of increasing educational alternatives for low socioeconomic parents on school segregation, school choice and ultimately on educational outcomes. The wider range of educational alternatives is given by the Subvención Escolar Preferencial (SEP), a targeted voucher that allows low-income parents to attend private voucher schools with copayment for free. In order to estimate the impact of the SEP on school choice and educational outcomes we implement an encouragement design that randomly provides parents information on the SEP."
