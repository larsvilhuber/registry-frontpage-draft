abstract: "There is growing interest in the potential for interventions to motivate behavior in policy settings. We study a large-scale (n=50,000) field experiment implemented by the Social Security Administration on one such “nudge” aimed at increasing the timely and accurate self-reporting of wages by Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients. Sending a letter reminding SSI recipients of their wage reporting responsibilities increased the likelihood of reporting any earnings and the amount of reported earnings in the three months immediately following the intervention by a statistically significant amount. However, this immediate relative effect of the letter decays slightly over time. While we find a robust effect of the reminder letter, the specific content of the letter—providing social information or highlighting the salience of penalties—had no systematic effect on behavior. We estimate that the letters generated roughly $18.88 in savings on average per dollar spent."
