abstract: "This study examines the separate and joint impacts of discounts on remittance prices and reminders to send remittances on the remittance behavior of Filipino migrants in the UAE. We develop a model that makes predictions regarding transaction frequency, amount per transaction, and total amount remitted in the presence of limited attention. The experimental study is designed to test these predictions."
