abstract: "This study investigates different motivations for information avoidance. For this purpose, participants take part in an intelligence test in which their results are compared to other participants. All participants are member of the same cohort of a Business School. Participants are asked to guess the share of others who performed the test better than them and are paid based on the accuracy of that guess. They are informed that they can find out the exact share after they made their initial estimate. If they find out their initial guess, they can revise their previous guess, ensuring full payout from the experiment but potentially also finding out unpleasant information about themselves. 
We investigate the fraction of participants who actively avoid that information, thereby foregoing earnings from the experiment. We furthermore test for different motivations that these participants could have for that decision. "
