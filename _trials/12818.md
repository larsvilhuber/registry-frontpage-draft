abstract: "In numerous developing urban areas, there is a prevalent issue of high levels of air pollution, leading to increasingly severe consequences. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that one out of every nine global deaths can be attributed to air pollution, with 90% of these fatalities occurring in low and middle-income countries (WHO 2016). This problem is particularly critical in India, which is home to 14 of the world's 20 most polluted cities. Some estimates suggest that if New Delhi were to meet the air quality standards set by the WHO, it could potentially extend the average life expectancy by up to 10 years (Greenstone and Fan, 2019).

Despite the significant health toll that air pollution exacts in these areas, there is a notable absence of public pressure on elected officials to implement policy solutions that would improve air quality. The demand for air quality improvements among the public seems to be relatively low. However, information has the potential to be a powerful tool in aligning people's beliefs and preferences with the goal of cleaner air, thereby incentivizing policymakers to respond to this demand. The central questions here are: Can information be a driving force in generating civic demand for better air quality? And in what manner does information act as a barrier? Is it more critical to emphasize the adverse effects of pollution exposure (related to individual stakes and beliefs) or to help citizens overcome the perception that this issue cannot be resolved by highlighting state capacity and action (fatalism concerning state)?

This study aims to investigate whether the limited private demand for reductions in air pollution plays a significant role in explaining the persistence of poor air quality. Such an understanding is crucial for governments to prioritize efforts to combat air pollution and reduce pollution-related mortality. To achieve this goal, we intend to conduct an incentivized field experiment to gauge and compare private demand for cleaner air with the corresponding willingness of the public to engage in various civic actions that would lead to improved air quality. Furthermore, we will evaluate how different information treatments influence these measures and whether they increase support for environmental safeguards.
