abstract: "The study aims to investigate prosocial behavior and is conducted by the online economic experimental laboratory at the University of Hamburg. The experiment provides empirical insights into donation preferences in a prosocial dilemma. The baseline experiment is a donation experiment while the intervention revolves around a prosocial dilemma. Based on the insights the study discusses the idea of conflicting prosocial preferences and whether economist should account for them in their game theoretical analyses of prosocial behavior.
