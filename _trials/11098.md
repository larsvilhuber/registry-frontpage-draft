abstract: "Many interventions aimed at improving students' reading skills have proven effective in small-scale evaluations. However, when educational interventions include more than a thousand students, effect sizes tend to approach zero. This problem of scalability is recognized in the literature, yet there exists very little systematic, research-based knowledge on how to solve it. 

If behavioral interventions cannot scale effectively, the societal value of the rigorous experimental studies is limited. Therefore, it is of utmost importance—and the purpose of this study—to understand how interventions can be made effective at scale. 

To study this question, we use an experimental approach where we randomly assign approximately 630 schools including approximately 6,000 students to either (i) a Control condition, (ii) a Treatment-as-Usual condition, or (iii) an Implementation Support condition. "
