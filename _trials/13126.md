abstract: "
Existing intergroup contact interventions involve sustained interactions with a fixed set of outgroup individuals â€“ such as in fixed sports teams, college dorms etc. A common finding is that such contact changes behavior toward the individuals interacted with, but not help change attitudes towards or dispel stereotypes about the outgroup at large. We will test whether an alternative type of contact causes more generalized effects: briefer contact with a rotating cast of outgroup members. This can inform policy regarding effective ways to integrate individuals in different settings. We will recruit young Hindu and Muslim individuals to work on simple production tasks in West Bengal, India. We will randomize each participant to (1) be paired with an outgroup or ingroup member, and (2) have their partner change every day or stay the same.
