abstract: "We study a tax evasion response to car taxes in Finland, where used car importers overstate the mileage to reduce the taxable value of the car. In the overall analysis we study many aspects of this phenomenon. We develop a tax evasion measure by comparing reported mileage information upon import with subsequent third-party information from vehicle inspections, and find that a decline in mileage — “missing miles” — is a common phenomenon. In the RCT we vary the salience of tax enforcement measures. For example, we inform in one treatment potential car importers that third party information is now more widely used in tax enforcement. The RCT was designed in co-operation with Finnish Customs. In the experiment different treatment letters were sent to potential car importers in the name of Customs. The baseline population in the treatment consisted of individuals who had imported a used car to Finland before. Four letter groups were randomized from this baseline population."
