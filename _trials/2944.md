abstract: "This study aims to investigate the reasons why the take-up rate of the public pension for self-employed workers such as herders in Mongolia is low and find effective policies to increase the take-up rate. We distribute different types of leaflets to local community (bagh) meeting participants with conducting a questionnaire survey to study their impact on take-up rate. We target 690 baghs in eight provinces, stratified at the province level and herder's population share within provinces. We will analyze the impact on take-up and contribution using administrative records."
