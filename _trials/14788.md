abstract: "How do employers respond when they learn about an automation shock? We leverage randomized information provision that exogenously shifts employers’ prior beliefs about automation rates to investigate the impact of automation on employment strategies, wage structures, skill investment plans, and information acquisition. We use the tax consulting and auditing sectors as a case in point due to their clearly defined job titles and significant exposure to generative language models, which present credible automation potential in white-collar professions. We assign respondents to one of three treatment groups that receive a correction of their beliefs using official estimates of automation rates, alongside a control group. We then study to what extent an update in their beliefs about job-specific automation rates causes reassignment to new roles, wage adjustments, education investment, and information acquisition. We also assess effects on firm-level outcomes, such as profit, revenue, and cost growth, and interpret our results through the lens of a task-based automation model."
