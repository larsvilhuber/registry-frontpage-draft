abstract: "We run an online field experiment in Germany designed to empirically study anticipated peer effects in the context of the decision to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Anticipated peer effects capture the idea that people want to lead by (good) example when having the opportunity to influence others. Our goal is to isolate anticipated from other behavioral motives operating once individualsâ€™ behavior is made observable to others such as social image effects. To this end, we will analyse individuals' stated and revealed willingness to register for and later receive a COVID-19 vaccination."
