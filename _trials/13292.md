abstract: "Social norms are sometimes misperceived, which has consequences for important economic outcomes. However, little is known about why misperceptions exist in the first place. This project focuses on the role of communication in shaping misperceptions, which I study in the context of masculinity norms among 8th to 9th graders in urban Brazil, in collaboration with the Secretariat of Education of the
City of Rio. In this study, I ask adolescents to self-select into groups to learn peersâ€™ opinions about masculinity, specifically about two traditional beliefs: men who cry are weak, and men should use violence to get respect if necessary. To estimate treatment effects, I randomly allocate participants to answer the outcome variables either before or after the discussion. "
