abstract: "Immigrants’ limited social networks are often seen as a key reason for the group’s relatively weak labor market outcomes. We propose one of the first field experiments to study how contact with natives affects immigrants’ social and economic integration. We have partnered with the largest NGO of its kind in Sweden, which annually matches several thousand native Swedes and immigrants to promote new social connections and facilitate integration. We will study how such connections influence immigrants’ social relations, attachment to Sweden, and economic outcomes in terms of employment and housing."
