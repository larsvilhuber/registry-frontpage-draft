abstract: "This project aims to understand correspondence bias and its determinants, especially its interactions with imperfect memory. Correspondence bias is the tendency to draw inferences about a person's enduring characteristics from behaviors that can be entirely explained by the incentives/environment that induce them. In our first study, we identify the bias through a clean experimental design that deals with three potential confounders. Subjects in our experiment play a dictator game as the dictator in the first stage. In stage 2, they are randomly matched into a group of 4 to play a benign game and a malign game. Benign game promotes cooperation, while the malign game motivates them to harm each other. In stage 3, we elicit their benign premium, which is their willingness to pay, as the receiver in the dictator game, to choose the one they play the benign game with as their dictator. Furthermore, our design enables us to investigate whether there are ways to potentially alleviate correspondence bias or even eliminate it. The second study concerns the interactions between imperfect memory and correspondence bias. The central hypothesis is actions are easier to recall than the environment in which actions take place. Consequently, correspondence bias becomes more severe when people have to rely on their long-term memory to make a decision as it becomes even harder to attribute behaviors to the environment instead of a person's enduring characteristics. We test this hypothesis by comparing benign premium, our measure for correspondence bias, when there is no delay between obtaining information in stage 2 and making partner choice in stage 3 and when there is a 1-hour delay between the two.
