abstract: "We explore mechanisms driving the effectiveness of the behavioral nudge known as Home Energy Reports (HERs).  HERs typically provide information about a household’s own energy usage, how that compares with neighbors’ usage, and estimated monetary savings from several suggested conservation actions. A household’s energy consumption is a function of both their behavioral choices, such as thermostat settings and appliance usage and the characteristics of their home that affect the rate at which it retains heat.  Therefore, a typical HER nudge is a signal about a combination of household behavior and the structural efficiency of the home.  The purpose of this study is to disentangle the individual effects of each of the two signals.  We will estimate the effects of a signal based either solely on the physical characteristics of the home and a signal based solely on household behavior.  Further, we will determine home or household characteristics that drive treatment effect heterogeneity for each type of signal, which could be used for targeting purposes.
   
We take advantage of a new technology that assesses the structural efficiency of a home based on images of heat loss taken from an aircraft-mounted infrared sensor during the winter heating season.  The technology measures the heat flow from different parts of the roof, comparing the flow of heat coming through the furnace vent to other components of the roof.  Importantly, since the measure comes from a comparison across the roof of a single home, it is driven solely by the building envelope and not by household choices about thermostat settings.
