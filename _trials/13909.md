abstract: "The experiment is designed to analyze the gap between public preferences and economically optimal environmental policy making. We confront respondents with the monetary cost induced by carbon pricing and and an alternative subsidy scheme. Given the low public acceptance of carbon pricing, we investigate whether preferences shift when the cost of subsidizing is made salient. A VAT increase is used to finance subsidy programs of varying efficiencies. If the preference for either instrument changes as costs are made salient, the experiment can provide an estimate of the public's additional willingness to pay for subsidies compared to Pigouvian pricing. The survey is conducted online in Germany and refers to examples from the housing sector to explain the carbon pricing mechanisms and the effect of subsidies."
