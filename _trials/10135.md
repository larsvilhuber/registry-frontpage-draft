abstract: "A well-functioning educational system plays an important role in educating students and training future workers. In many settings, a vocational degree may be a steppingstone toward a professional career and financial security. Despite the amount of resources that the Greek Government pours into their government-sponsored vocational training program every year, vocational schools in Greece exhibit dropout rates as high as 30%. Moreover, a sizable fraction of dropouts re-enrol in vocational training programs later in life. The reasons why students drop out in such large numbers and/or re-enrol in the program later in life are not well understood.

We propose to study these phenomena through the evaluation of a management intervention that aims at reducing dropout rates and evaluate its effectiveness using a randomized control trial (RCT)."
