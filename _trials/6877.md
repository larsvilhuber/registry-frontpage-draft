abstract: "The effect of relative performance feedback, especially ordinal rank feedback, on performance has been broadly discussed in recent decades. However, there are few studies on the relationship between the impacts of providing relative performance feedback and the choice of comparison group. This trail intends to investigate the effects of rank feedback provision on subsequent performance, and whether the effect tends to be enhanced in smaller same-ability groups. "
