abstract: "Lack of skill development has been a core policy issue in India over the last decade and ambitious skill training programs have been initialized by the government to skill the youth. However, policy reports and prior studies suggest that these programs have had little impact on the livelihood of the youth. In this context, for both wage and self-employment training programs, this study project proposes to partner with Yuva Parivartan to examine two broad research questions: (i) how does the provision of post-training assistance (access to information and resources) impact the labor market outcomes of trainees? (ii) does the mode of information dissemination (either through general announcements, access to experts either on public forums or private sessions have a differential impact? Put together, these questions could shed light on the importance of providing comprehensive support to trainees along with the forum through which this is provided. "
