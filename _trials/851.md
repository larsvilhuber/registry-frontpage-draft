abstract: "Weak governance is a critical constraint in delivering quality education in developing countries. A recent review of a decade of education research in India concluded that “business as usual expansion in education spending is unlikely to yield improved outcomes without significant improvements in pedagogy and governance of the education system” (Muralidharan 2013).  A striking indicator of weak governance in education in India is the high rate of teacher absence, estimated as 26.2% in 2003 and 23.6% in 2010, leading to an estimated fiscal cost of $1.5 billion annually (Muralidharan et. al. 2014).

We propose to conduct a randomized evaluation of one of the most ambitious recent attempts by a developing country government to improve education governance at scale.  The Madhya Pradesh (MP) School Quality Assessment Program (MPSQA) – officially called the MP Shaala Gunwatta program – is a comprehensive attempt to improve school governance in the Indian state of MP and has been designed in a partnership between the Government of MP (GoMP), DFID, and Absolute Return for Kids (ARK). The program targets school governance directly through a combination of (a) regular monitoring of schools, (b) creation of school report cards, and a customized school improvement plan, (c) quarterly follow-ups on progress against this plan, and (d) the leveraging of ICT tools to collect and report real-time records of all assessment results, school improvement plans, and follow-ups to a dedicated online system. MPSQA was piloted and refined in a sample of 100 schools in 2013-14 (phase 1), and has been rolled out across 2,000 schools in the  school year (2014-15) (phase 2). The Principal Investigators (PI’s)  have worked with the project implementation team from ARK and GoMP and have successfully randomized the rollout of the program across ~2,000 schools in August 2014, to enable a credible evaluation of the MPSQA program on both school process outcomes and student learning outcomes. 

The evaluation, with a sample of 534 schools (primary and secondary), will assess the effects of the program on key governance metrics (e.g. teacher absence) as well as student academic outcomes over a period of 18 months.
