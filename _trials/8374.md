abstract: "We study the impact of value chain development in women’s farmer producer organisations on household and women’s economic outcomes and their agency in the enterprise and the household. The project “Gramya-shakti” aims to collectivise rural women into producer groups for processing of local spices for sale in high-end urban markets. We propose a village level randomised evaluation design by which the project will be rolled out on randomly selected spice-producing villages. The control villages were be intervened under the project. We use three rounds of household and enterprise panel data and process level  data to estimate program impacts and understand the mechanisms of change."
