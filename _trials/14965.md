abstract: "Countries worldwide are transitioning to renewable energy to meet Net Zero targets, but renewable sources like solar and wind cannot easily adjust to fluctuating energy demands. One way to address this challenge is by encouraging demand flexibility—the ability of consumers to adjust their energy use based on the grid’s needs.

Time-of-use (TOU) tariffs are a key tool for promoting demand flexibility. These tariffs offer lower electricity prices during off-peak hours (when demand is low) and higher prices during peak times (when demand is high), incentivizing consumers to shift their energy use and help balance the grid.

This study has three objectives. First, we will test email campaigns designed to encourage customers of a UK utility to sign up for a TOU tariff. Second, we will collaborate with the utility to develop and compare different TOU tariff designs to see which ones drive the most sign-ups. Finally, we will assess how enrolling in a TOU tariff affects household energy usage."
