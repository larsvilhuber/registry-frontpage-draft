abstract: "In a laboratory environment, we analyze the role of payment structures in energy consumption. Energy use is billed after consumption has taken place, such that a dynamic trade-off between consumption and payment of the good emerges. Such “bill-me-later”-systems give rise to uncertainty, inattention and (hyperbolic) discounting of future costs. This research focusses on the discounting of costs, by, holding information on and saliency of costs constant, randomly changing only the timing of the energy bill. 
Building on recent laboratory and field experiments on present bias, we adapt the common setting with immediate effort costs and delayed benefits to a setting with immediate benefits and delayed costs. The benefits and costs are framed as consuming light and paying an energy bill. The control scenario is billing one week after consumption has taken place, the treatment scenario is billing immediately after consumption. This change in the payment structure allows us to estimate the influence of (hyperbolic) discounting on energy consumption.
