abstract: "We set up a customized random experiment within the Austrian segment of the most comprehensive European wealth survey, the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS). The randomization was implemented a priori so that each household in the sample had a 50% chance of being selected for the treated group.

The group of non-treated households went through the questionnaire from one question to the next without a break before the questions on taxation. The treated group was given specific information on net wealth. This information included their own net wealth recorded in the survey, their position in the net wealth distribution (decile), as well as information on the overall net wealth distribution (in 10 percentiles). Thus, depending on the actual level of wealth reported in the survey, the information individual households received varied as well.

After receiving the information, the treated group was asked about their attitudes towards taxation with the same questions as the non-treated households.
