abstract: "The aim of the study is to examine whether work-experience from the non-traditional labor market (or the gig economy) is valuable in terms of finding employment in the regular labor market. We intend to study this question through a correspondence study conducted in the Swedish labor market, where we send out fictitious applications to companies with open vacancies in entry-level jobs. By randomly changing the job seekers' labor market experience we can compare the number of positive responses from employers for applicants with (i) experience from a job in the non-traditional labor market (the so-called gig-economy) (ii) experience from a (similar) job in the traditional labor market (iii) no labor market experience. This method has been successfully used to study, among other things, the effect of long-term unemployment and ethnic hiring discrimination.
