abstract: "This research project investigates how the exposure to different role models impact children’s interest in STEM fields. We design a field experiment integrated within a Computational Thinking (CT) teaching proposal in Uruguay to explore two critical hurdles in children’s interest in STEM: gender and growth mindset beliefs. We will manipulate a teaching module called ‘Write your own adventure’ - provided in the initial level of CT - and randomly assigned classes to one of four different biographies of accomplished scientists. These biographies will manipulate (i) either the gender (male or female) scientist, or (ii) the extent of growth mindset (whether they succeeded or they had to overcome academic struggles since the young age). We will assess the impact on children’s interest in STEM across the 4 biographies and a control group exposed to another teaching module unrelated to the previous biographies. Finally, we will shed light on the underlying mechanisms by analyzing how children gender stereotypes and norms, and beliefs about growth mindset change when exposed to different role models. Our results will contribute to better understand how to foster an environment where all children can pursue and reach their full potential."
