abstract: "Sustainability and resource allocation are central concerns in modern economics. Ensuring the well-being of future generations is vital to the survival of families, organizations, nations, and even the global ecosystem. Ensuring that todayâ€™s consumption does not deplete resources for future generations is a crucial issue for policymaking. Moreover, the challenge lies in the fact that securing the future often demands sacrifices in the present. Artificial intelligence (AI) is starting to permeate economic and social life. It has demonstrated significant potential in optimizing decision-making processes, offering personalized financial advice, and reshaping how individuals communicate and interact. Given the importance of sustainability and the rise of artificial intelligence in the real world, we ask the research question of whether advice given by artificial intelligence can improve intergenerational cooperation.

Specifically, we employ advice generated by a large language model and compare the effect of AI-generated advice to human advice on promoting cooperation among non-overlapping intergenerational players. "
