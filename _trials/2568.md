abstract: "This project examines the role of commitment and motivation in education by introducing a program called CollegeBetter.com which acts as a commitment device and monetary incentive to improve undergraduate academic performance. The zero-sum mechanism is based off a parimutuel betting market, where students join a pool by placing a monetary wager on themselves to achieve the pool’s “commitment challenge.” Students who successfully commit to the challenge 1) recover their wagers and 2) split losing wagers proportionally. A series of initial surveys and field experiments were conducted at UC Davis from 2015 to 2016 in order to investigate selection into and the effectiveness of the program. Field experiments will be expanded to the University of Hawaii at Manoa starting in 2018. "
