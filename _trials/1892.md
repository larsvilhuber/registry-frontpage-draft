abstract: "In Europe, it has become increasingly difficult for young people to find decent-paying jobs and move out from their parents' homes. In response, local governments have begun working with independent organizations to try and halt this growing crisis. The goal of these actions is to favor professional integration and autonomous housing for youth. 

In 2010, the General Council of Bas-Rhin (France) started implementing the "Pass'Accompagnement" program. This project is to be offered to 1400 youth in the department, aged from 18 to 25. It provides personalized mentorship to young people experiencing unemployment or homelessness and aims to support access to housing and favor more autonomy for youth.

Each beneficiary will be assigned a mentor meant to advise them in matters of employment, education, and housing over the course of two years. If program participants find autonomous housing, the General Council will pledge to pay the rent if the participant fail to do so over the following year and a half. Finally, participants may receive a grant of up to 1,800 Euros (2,593 USD). 

The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention in France using a randomized experiment, with randomization at the individual level. The evaluation will be implemented in two waves. In each wave, 300 marginalized youth will be assigned to the beneficiary group and 400 others to the control group. We will identify the causal effect of the intervention by comparing differences between the two groups in terms of social and professional integration as well as housing quality and stability, and in terms of cognitive and non-cognitive skills. In addition, potential heterogeneous effects between rural and urban areas will be assessed.

All participants (whether or not they will benefit from the program) will be interviewed three time over the course of three years: before the randomization takes place, and one year and two years after randomization."
