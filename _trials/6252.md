abstract: "We run a online experiment to understand what is the effect of learning other players' payment in a hierarchical group. The participants will complete two games: a costly punishment game and a sorting task. In the punishment game the players can reduce the payment of the other group members at a cost, while in the sorting task they will choose which group would they want to join. We randomly vary the information participants see about their peers' payment."
