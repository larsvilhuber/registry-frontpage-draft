abstract: "This study investigates the impact of the Program "Em Busca do Tesouro" in promoting financial, fiscal, and civic education in elementary schools in the Federal District, Brazil. Developed by the National Treasury Team in partnership with the Maurício de Souza Institute, the program presents concepts related to financial decisions, public administration, and the relationship between the civic population and the government through comics with popular characters from Turma da Mônica (a famous national cartoon created by Maurício de Souza). The program is aimed at 4th and 5th-grade students, and its pilot is being conducted in a selected group of schools, in which students in the target age group will be exposed to program materials and involved in classroom activities. After the intervention, students will answer a questionnaire to assess the impact on their knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to fiscal, financial, and civic education. Expected results include increased students' understanding of the concepts covered. possible changes in their attitudes and habits regarding savings and other financial issues, a higher understanding and appreciation of public goods, and more active behavior regarding authority's accountability."
