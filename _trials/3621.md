abstract: "This study examines whether providing motivation and personalized feedback can improve the performance of government officials. In our setting, school directors from all public schools in the Dominican Republic were told to execute a specific task. We randomly varied the ways in which the instructions were given to test whether motivation and personalized feedback on previous task performance can increase the task execution."
