abstract: "The transition from primary to high school can be costly, even when tuition fees are low or zero.  In this project, undertaken in Kenya, we provide parents of soon-to-graduate primary school children with a variety of vehicles to save for these expenses, and measure their responses in terms of take-up, amounts saved, and enrollment and attendance at high school.  The primary focus is on a mobile money lock-box, held within a bank account, itself linked to and accessed through a mobile money platform.   Balances held to maturity in the lock box earn a bonus interest rate, but this bonus is lost on early withdrawals, which can only be accessed after a waiting period of 48 hours.  We measure the net effect of the time penalty (the lock) and the interest rate bonus, by comparing a treatment group with a pure control group and with a group that is encouraged to save on their mobile phone, but not in the lock box.  We cross the different mobile money product arms of our RCT with a text messaging intervention reminding users of the goals they set at recruitment."
