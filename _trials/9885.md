abstract: "Preference elicitation is a key challenge within the analytical framework of microeconomics. In this intervention, we propose a novel empirical and Bayesian approach to measuring individual preferences in a developing-country context. We present participants with binary choices between bundles of goods - recorded choices are then aggregated into preference estimates using Gaussian Processes. In this proof-of-concept study, we aim to: i) demonstrate that this method is capable of delivering important preference metrics (such as cross elasticity estimates) in the field, and ii) illustrate the robustness of this method. Our analysis is based on novel survey data collected in collaboration with BRACU in Bangladesh. "
