abstract: "Building on the seminal work of Benabou and Tirole (2004), we study the motivated belief on present bias. In particular, it is beneficial from the current selfâ€™s perspective to maintain an optimistic belief about present bias, as this optimistic belief can motivate the future self to undertake challenging tasks. If the future self is fully aware of her present bias, she might be too discouraged to even make an attempt. We test this motivated belief on present bias using a field experiment in the classroom setting. "
