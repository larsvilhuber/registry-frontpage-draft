abstract: "Divisiveness, polarization, and social fragmentation are major obstacles to social progress. They are deepening despite a proliferation of programs created to foster cohesion. Most such programs address divisiveness at the level of form and technique, rather than underlying worldviews and motivations. We explore an alternative pathway built on principles of the oneness of humankind and unity in diversity. We develop and evaluate a “unity in diversity” program that seeks to tap the roots of human identity and motivation. We implement this three-week, intensive program with youth in India. Partnering with a large nonprofit that provides free in-person training for young people, we evaluate the program using a cluster randomized controlled trial involving almost 9,000 individuals. We examine to what degree and how the program affects different types of outcomes such as: 1) discriminatory behaviors (measured using incentivized dictator and trust games); 2) decisions to work with people of diverse backgrounds (measured by examining teammate choices in a real-world project); 3) global citizenship (measured by behaviors associated with participation in an international penpal program); and 4) discriminatory attitudes by caste, religion, gender (measured using survey scales). Evaluating the program’s average and heterogeneous impacts along these and other dimensions will generate knowledge around how youth can actively build united and diverse communities."
