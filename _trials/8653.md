abstract: "We investigate how different ranking methods impact risk-taking in the standard portfolio choice in a between subject lab experiment. Participants are randomly assigned to groups of three participants and endowed with different wealth levels. The assignment of wealth is either determined by chance, by a real effort tournament, or by a financial literacy quiz. We hypothesize that the different rankings system impact risk-taking differently. In addition, we aim at observing if these differences are moderated by the individual personality trait of entitlement. "
