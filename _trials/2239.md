abstract: "Why do parents in low-income countries send their children to private schools? This paper seeks to shed light on this question by evaluating the impact of randomly allocated vouchers that provided families tuition-free access to private schools. In a randomized control trial in East Delhi, treated students were given five years worth of tuition vouchers to attend a nearby private school. Six years out, we track these students and collect information on their academic abilities and other important characteristics. "
