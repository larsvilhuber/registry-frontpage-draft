abstract: "will undertake a series of mini-trials as part of CrowdFlex Beta, a UKRI and Ofgem funded programme of work. The trials will encourage residential energy customers to turn down or up their energy consumption during flexibility events, as well as making their appliances available to Flexibility Service Providers to remotely control for flexibility both inside and outside of specific events. The first mini-trial will take place from May 2nd to July 2024. This mini-trial will involve a Randomised Control Trial (RCT). 
Randomisation will involve two steps: 
Invitation to the trial (Randomised Encouragement Design – the subject of this pre-analysis plan):
Invitation randomisation: We will randomise invitations from the pool of eligible customers for the mini-trial. The pool of eligible customers will be refreshed before each mini-trial. The participants for the later mini-trial will be a mix of the previous mini-trial participants, customers from the first eligible pool and customers from the refreshed pool. 
Within the list of customers that have signed up for the minitrials (Randomised Control Trial): 
Wait-list randomization: We will waitlist some customers who opt into the CrowdFlex programme, leaving them as a ‘control’ group until the final event of the first mini-trial.
Individual-level randomisation within a mini-trial into 5 treatment arms: low, medium, high, low to high and finally high to low incentives during flexibility events
The analysis of the RCT design is the subject of a formal trial protocol as part of CrowdFlex Beta and is registered at [https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/13539]. This pre-analysis plan focuses on the randomised encouragement design. "
