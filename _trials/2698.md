abstract: "This trial is part of a collaborative project of the Australian National University and the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). The aim of the trial is to study the effect of providing information about unsustainable tax debt levels and the availability of financial help tools to small businesses with an outstanding tax debt during outbound phone calls. The analysis will be based on 6,345 small businesses that received outbound calls from 87 ATO officers. About half of the businesses were randomly assigned to the treatment group. The remaining businesses received 'business as usual' calls and constitute the control group. Outcome measures include variables indicating payment behavior, the establishment of payment arrangements and the take-up of various financial help tools.
