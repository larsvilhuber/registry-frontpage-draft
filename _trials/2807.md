abstract: "The Seattle-King County Creating Moves to Opportunity (CMTO) Demonstration aims to help families with children who receive Housing Choice Vouchers (also known as Section 8 Vouchers) have the opportunity to move to and persist in higher opportunity neighborhoods. Families with children under 15 who receive a Housing Choice Voucher from the Seattle Housing Authority (SHA) and King County Housing Authority (KCHA) who elect to participate in the study will be randomly assigned to either the treatment group (expected to be 642 families), who receives access to CMTO services, or the control group (expected to be 642 families), who have access to the normal support services provided by the housing authorities to new voucher-holders. CMTO services include housing locator services (housing search assistance, neighborhood education, and support in preparing rental applications) and access to flexible financial assistance to help cover costs associated with opportunity moves (e.g. security deposits, moving expenses). Additional outreach will be conducted to landlords in opportunity neighborhoods, and landlords will receive financial incentives for leasing to CMTO families in order to help increase the supply of units available to families. Future phases of research may involve randomizing the types of services families receive. The primary outcomes of interest are to determine (1) if CMTO services increase the number of families moving to high opportunity neighborhoods, and (2) how long they persist in those neighborhoods.

The second phase builds on the lessons from the initial phase by testing three treatment groups that aim to increase the both explore the precise mechanisms that explain familiesâ€™ decisions to move to opportunity areas and explore opportunities for more scalable housing mobility programs. Families with children under 15 who receive a Housing Choice Voucher from the Seattle Housing Authority and King County Housing Authority who elect to participate in the study will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups who each receive a particular set of CMTO services (expected to be about 160 families each), or the control group (expected to be about 160 families), which has access to the normal support services provided by the housing authorities to new voucher holders. Families in the Coaching Services and Resources group receive housing locator services, access to flexible financial assistance to help cover costs associated with opportunity moves (e.g. security deposits, moving expenses), and connections to landlords identified in opportunity areas through proactive outreach and incentivized to participate through financial backstops and streamlined processes. Those in the Cost-Optimized Services group receive pared down versions of the three program supports outlined above, and those in the Financial Assistance group only receive the full flexible financial assistance."
