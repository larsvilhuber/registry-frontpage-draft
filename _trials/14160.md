abstract: "Trust in public institutions is crucial for compliance with recommended behaviors that minimize negative externalities and improve societal welfare. Previous studies have shown how exposure to polarizing media content and living through a crisis can rapidly erode citizensâ€™ trust in public institutions. This study aims to provide novel experimental evidence on the efficacy of light-touch scalable interventions that can rebuild trust in public institutions. "
