abstract: "We describe the analysis plan for a field experiment that will examine the importance of caste and salience in the transmission of information in rural India. The participants are social workers and potential beneficiaries living in randomly selected villages in Karnataka. The social workers are provided information about a particular health insurance scheme implemented by the Indian government. We then ask them to transmit this information to the potential beneficiaries. Each social workers is matched with four potential beneficiaries, and we measure information transmission by fielding a knowledge test to the beneficiaries before and after their interaction with the social worker. We randomly vary whether or not social worker and beneficiaries are matched on caste, and whether or not beneficiary caste is revealed to the social worker."
