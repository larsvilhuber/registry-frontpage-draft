abstract: "While many of the world’s poor consume inadequate amount of calories and consume calories with low nutritional value, there has been little work on how this may shape their behaviors. Using a lab-in-the-field and field experiment settings in the context of a floriculture plant in Ethiopia, this study investigates the short and the long-term effects of nutrition on labor productivity and economic decision-making by randomly providing nutritious filling snacks to workers. To explain the mechanism through which this relationship might exist, I examine to what extent hunger alleviation affects individual’s prosociality, attention, stress, and physical ability. By examining behavioral outcomes related to productivity and economic decision-making, this study shifts the focus from how nutrition affects the physical aspects to the mental and the behavioral aspects."
