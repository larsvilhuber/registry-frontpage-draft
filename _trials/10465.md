abstract: "Since the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic, further EU integration steps in health policy gained renewed attention. However, we know little about the public support for a so-called European Health Union. To contribute to this debate, a survey vignette is designed to investigate public preferences towards a stronger role of the EU in the health care systems of EU member states. The role of individual characteristics in support for alternative policy designs will be investigated."
