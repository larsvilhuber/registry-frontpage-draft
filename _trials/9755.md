abstract: "Rule following is fundamental to social order and often a practical form of human cooperation. Both rule following and cooperation have in common that they are individually costly but collectively beneficial in many interesting situations. Here we investigate how cooperation in a social dilemma situation is linked to peopleâ€™s propensity to follow costly rules. This study comprises of five treatments which examine how rule following behaviour and cooperation in a public good setting are related. We will conduct an online experiment with 520 participants on the platform Prolific, using the software LIONESS Lab. In a follow up study, we analyse the underlying mechanisms which may explain differences in behaviour observed in Study 1. We examine differences in social expectations (both normative and empirical expectations) and conditional preferences (both normative and empirical) in the tasks participants completed in Study 1. That is, in Study 2 we analyse differences in social expectations and conditional preferences for three classifications of rules: (i) pointless rule; (ii) pointful rule; and (iii) pointful rule with stated purpose."
