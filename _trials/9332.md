abstract: "The linguistic-savings hypothesis (LSH) indicates that languages with future tense reference would distance people’s perception of future events and causally reduce future-oriented behaviors. Chen, He, and Riyanto (2019) examined this hypothesis taking an experimental approach based on a Chinese linguistic feature: the omission of the future tense is allowable in grammar. To be specific, the auxiliary word ‘will’ was arranged in the treatment group and was omitted in the control group. This manipulation was expected to drive subjects to be more impatient in the treatment group. Nevertheless, no supporting evidence for the LSH was found. It is essential to have a stronger intervention and investigate the cognitive mechanism of the LSH. Therefore, we replicate Chen et al. (2019) and modify it in several dimensions. First, instead of using a price list to elicit preference, we use a binary choice design to strengthen the treatment effect. Secondly, we apply an eye-tracker to investigate the visual pattern and measure the percentage of fixation on the key word “will”. Lastly, we estimate parameters in both discounting models and a drift-diffusion model at an individual level. These modifications lead to a more comprehensive exploration of the cognitive process of the LSH."
