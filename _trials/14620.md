abstract: "This study evaluates the impacts of decentralized school meal procurement from agricultural cooperatives on children and the local economy in Burundi using a two-dimensional impact evaluation. The research examines how this procurement model affects the local economy—including cooperatives and farmers—alongside children's nutrition, health, and education outcomes.  

The intervention replaces the centralized delivery of school meal crops by the World Food Programme (WFP) with a system where schools procure these crops using Commodity Vouchers (CVs). Impacts on schools and children are assessed through a randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 243 schools across 200 school clusters, randomly assigned to either the decentralized procurement model or the status quo.  Simultaneously, impacts on the local economy are evaluated by randomizing contract awards during competitive tendering at the district level. Eligible cooperatives compete for contracts to supply up to three key crops: maize, rice, and beans.  

The study leverages extensive survey and secondary data, including digitized meal and attendance records from schools, anthropometric and cognitive assessments of children, seasonal production and revenue data from cooperatives and farmer households, and commodity price data from local market vendors. This research builds on a pilot evaluation conducted in 2022–23 (AEARCTR-0011995).  "
