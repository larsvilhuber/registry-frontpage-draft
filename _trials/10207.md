abstract: "We study whether the type of human capital (specific vs. general) and the type of employee (unskilled vs. skilled) matter for managers’ decisions to approve lifelong learning opportunities for their employees in their company. For that purpose, we implement a vignette experiment among managers from small and medium-sized enterprises in Germany, who are presented with hypothetical scenarios involving fictitious employees. Respondents will be asked about their likelihood to allow this described employee to attend further training. The main objective is to understand obstacles to employees' additional training and lifelong learning activities within organizations."
