abstract: "Small businesses are widely believed to serve as engines for innovation, employment and social mobility. Yet, data suggest that very few small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in low-income countries grow into larger businesses. Because SME owners often have limited human capital and lack management experience (Bruhn et al. 2012, Bloom et al. 2010, Drexler et al. 2011), many governments and development agencies invest in technical assistance programs aimed at training and mentoring entrepreneurs and helping SMEs to develop expansion strategies. However, little rigorous research exists on if and why these types of training programs are effective and whether they can be designed more efficiently to enable transformational entrepreneurship and poverty alleviation.

This evaluation assesses the impact of TechnoServe’s Women Mean Business program, which provides business skills training and mentoring to women entrepreneurs in Central Uganda. In addition to analyzing the direct impact of the training on recipient SMEs, we also examine the overall welfare effects on the community – a perspective that is needed to inform policymaking about SMEs but which is missing from most existing evaluations. A clustered randomization design enables us to capture spillovers from the training on non-participating businesses, such as stealing customers from competitors or sharing information with collaborators. A series of consumer-focused interviews will allow us to explore a new approach that moves beyond firm outcomes to look at the broader welfare effect on the community, tracking changes in price, quality, variety, and service that may benefit or harm consumers. Finally, the study will provide insight into aspects of program design, such as which types of entrepreneurs and businesses benefit the most from managerial training, which may help to target future programs more effectively. This evaluation will expand our understanding of how SMEs in low-income countries operate and how improved business operations affect the broader community."
