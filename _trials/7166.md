abstract: "This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of measures to support young women making the transition from school to work in Kenya, and to provide scalable recommendations to address the barriers they face, on both the supply and demand sides. Specifically, the intervention proposed for evaluation is a course that provides soft skills training, information, and motivation to women about the opportunities and possibilities for women entering the labor market. The intervention aims at improving women’s labor market outcomes.
The project will generate new evidence on the effectiveness of these interventions to address gender gaps in labour market participation and gender-based employment segregation in the context of Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) programs in Kenya. Our research method employs a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the impact of the intervention.
