abstract: "Do people process ego-relevant information about themselves in an optimistic manner? We experimentally investigate how people update their beliefs about their relative performance in an IQ-test for different levels of ego-relevance. 

We implement the following experimental methodology: First, subjects perform an IQ-related test. Second, we elicit subjects' prior beliefs about their relative performance. Third, we provide subjects with polarizing information about the validity of IQ-tests. Fourth, subjects receive noisy but objective performance feedback. Fifth, we elicit subjects' posterior beliefs about their relative performance. The last two stages are repeated such that subjects receive two binary signals and report their updated beliefs twice. 

The experimental design allows us to compare subjects' belief updating process to the normative benchmark of Bayes' rule for different levels of ego-relevance. By exogenously varying the perceived ego-relevance of IQ-tests, the results provide a clean test of the optimistic belief updating hypothesis, because prior beliefs are held constant across treatments. In addition, we elicit subjects' effort in the IQ-test and subjects' perceived validity of the IQ-test for study success and job success. To this end, we examine how subjects engage in ex-post rationalization of negative feedback.
