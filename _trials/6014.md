abstract: "Algorithmic news feeds provide a combination of news stories with a very high degree of personalization. Personalized political information may affect democratic outcomes by how it bolsters false consensus beliefs, and that, in contexts of high levels of polarization, may create an artificial wedge between political parties. This paper investigates the implications of personalized news feeds, by implementing a pre-registered, globally replicable, lab-in-the-field experiment, in which subjects are treated with a custom-developed news app, and then evaluated with surveys in the changes to their political and democratic beliefs. The experiment is a patient-preferred trial to explicitly account for the impact of self-selection. Results from the pilot show that algorithmic news feed are quite powerful in determining media diets, but ineffective at changing preferences."
