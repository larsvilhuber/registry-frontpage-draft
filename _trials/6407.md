abstract: "Digital financial services such as Mobile Money have the potential to contribute to financial inclusion of many small-scale business owners in low-income countries. However, limited financial literacy among small-scale entrepreneurs may constrain the understanding of costs and benefits of these kinds of financial services. The field experiment studies the impact of a financial education intervention randomly offered to small-scale entrepreneurs in trading centers in Western Uganda on take-up and usage patterns of digital payment services (e.g., mobile money) and other household and small-scale business financial behaviors (such as savings, investments, and credit). The treatments are randomized at the trading-center-level. Additionally, the treatment intensity (share of entrepreneurs invited)  is randomly varied within trading-centers to study the extent of information spillovers and other potential externalities. Outcomes are measured in hypothetical choice experiments and using (self-reported) survey data. D"
