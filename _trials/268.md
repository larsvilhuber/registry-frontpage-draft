abstract: "This study aims to analyze the learning about product quality by farmers who are encouraged to experiment with inputs. We will study whether such experimentation leads to higher adoption of products that were shown to have higher returns on a farmer’s own farm. After identifying farmers who are interested in participating in an agronomical trial in 96 villages, we will randomly select half of the villages to participate. They will be invited to experiment with several inputs and practices, under guidance of an agronomical researcher. By comparing these treatment farmers with the control farmers (the other half) we will test whether the reduction in asymmetry of information about the returns to different inputs translates into a higher take up of the good while crowding out the lower return ones. We focus on whether learning-by-doing differs with soil characteristics and farmers’ own characteristics (in particular their technical, cognitive and non-cognitive skills). The random assignment generates an experimental control group that also allows analyzing potential biases in agronomical field trials."
