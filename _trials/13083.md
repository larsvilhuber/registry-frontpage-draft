abstract: "A powerful test of Varian's (1982) generalised axiom of revealed preference (GARP) with two goods requires the consumer's budget line to pass through two demand vectors revealed as chosen given other budget sets. In a laboratory experiment using this idea, participants face a series of 8 successive grouped portfolio selection problems. Each selection problem has up to three stages, where later budget sets depende on participants' choices at earlier stages. We examine whether participants' choices satisfy GARP by using a relatively generous non-parametric test. Furthermore, we implement time pressure into the choice problem and collect mouse-tracking data to investigate participants' thought processes and attention."
