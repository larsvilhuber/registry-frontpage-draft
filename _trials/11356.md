abstract: "This is a survey experiment to assess whether competition affects the quality of scientific research. We will reach out to corresponding authors on scientific papers via a fully anonymous email survey.

We will cross-randomize across two sets of questions. The first set of questions will assess whether scientists think that important work is more likely to be competitive. We will pose a hypothetical scenario about working on a project, but randomly vary the expected journal placement of the project. We will then ask scientists how likely they think it is that another team is working on a similar project.

The second set of questions will assess whether scientists work faster and less carefully if they believe the project is competitive (i.e., multiple parties are working on the same project). We will pose a hypothetical scenario about working on a project, but randomly vary the probability that another team is working on the project. We will then ask scientists (a) how long will they spend finishing the project and (b) which tasks would the do prior to publication (replication, additional analyses, etc.)"
