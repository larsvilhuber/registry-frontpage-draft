abstract: "The overall objective of the Education Quality Improvement Program (EQIP) is to improve the quality of primary education by improving the skills of Belize's teachers in mathematics, science and language arts. To achieve the objective, half of the country's teaching force has been trained in classroom practices that use an inquiry- and problem-based (IPB) pedagogy. This approach is a sharp departure from the pedagogy previously used, which was predominantly teacher-centered and did not actively engage students in activities that may help them develop analytical and critical-thinking skills. A randomized control trial reveals that the IPB produces learning gains for students in all three subject areas.  "
