abstract: "This project seeks to identify how bottom-up community interventions and top-down audits change spatial patterns of medicinal drug diversion, impact access to public health aid, and perceptions of clinic accountability using a two-arm factorial randomized control trial. While firm estimates are lacking, medication theft is likely one of the leading causes of preventable disease in low income countries. According to Malawi Ministry of Health officials, 29% of spending on drugs and medical supplies disappears due to theft alone. Malawi is a particularly extreme outlier, but these estimates are not far off from estimates in other countries. We introduce a novel measurement protocol that allows to more precisely estimate these theft rates, and the impact of these interventions on drug theft across the supply chain. "
