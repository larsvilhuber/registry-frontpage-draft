abstract: "This study aims to evaluate the effect of a digital waste segregation curriculum called 'Waste No More' on students of primary schools in the villages in Maharashtra, India. To establish causality, 118 schools from 52 Gram Panchayats (GPs) are randomly assigned to the treatment group who will receive the digital curriculum, while 125 schools from 53 GPs are assigned to the control group. A baseline and an end-line survey as well as an online waste segregation game involving students and teachers from both treatment and control schools will be carried out to measure the impact of the digital curriculum on their knowledge, attitudes, and actions.
