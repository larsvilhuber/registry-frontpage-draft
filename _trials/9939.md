abstract: "In the study, we examine the impact of flood experience on individuals' altruism and trust levels in incentivized lab-in-the field games, controlling for their risk and time preferences. We divide subjects into three groups: (i) non-flood-prone households; (ii) flood-prone households who have suffered no flood event since 2019; and (iii) flood-prone households who have suffered at least one flood event since 2019. These subjects will play a dictator game and a trust game to explore how flood exposure affects their giving and trust in others."
