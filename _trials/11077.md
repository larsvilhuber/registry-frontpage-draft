abstract: "UNESCO estimates that 11 million girls did not return to school after the COVID-19 pandemic closures. This not only threatens their future perspectives but also puts them at risk of unplanned pregnancies, early marriage, and violence. A valuable asset that empowers girls and facilitates their transport to school like a bicycle ([1 ]) might mitigate the adverse effects of COVID-19, encourage girls to go back to school and minimize harmful effects on their health and wellbeing. We evaluate the long-term impacts of an in-kind transfer, a bicycle, received by students in rural Zambia in 2017, on girls’ economic and social empowerment. We further assess how receipt of a bicycle alleviates the detrimental impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on school dropout, teenage pregnancies, early marriages, and gender-based violence. Using the random allocation of schools to receive bicycles in 2017 or not, we survey girls that were enrolled back then. We hypothesize that the pandemic has significantly increased girls’ likelihood to have dropped out of school, to have suffered violence, to have been married, and to be pregnant, but that receipt of the in-kind transfer in 2017 cushions against these negative impacts."
