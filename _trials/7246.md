abstract: "Nearly a half century after the civil rights movement, racial inequity remains a defining feature of U.S. society. We formalize a model of structural racism and empirically test a central implication – that beliefs regarding racial discrimination in one system will tend to be correlated with discrimination in other systems – through two complementary RCTs. Focusing on the settings of policing and healthcare provision, our first experiment examines the impact of providing information about racial discrimination in policing on perceptions of discrimination in the healthcare sector among 1,000 Black and White individuals. In a second experiment, we then investigate whether counter signals made by healthcare professionals affect this correlation in beliefs among 7,500 Black respondents, and whether such signals enhance actual healthcare demand. Understanding how racial discrimination affects beliefs and behavior across systems is critical to reducing racial inequality in the United States given the history of structural racism. We focus on the consequences of discrimination in criminal justice, one of the key institutions generating inequality and an issue of pressing public policy, and on healthcare because the medical system plays an important role in combating the severe consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigating its disparate impact on marginalized groups."
