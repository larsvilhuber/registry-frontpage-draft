abstract: "With increasing internet accessibility in India, channels of information exchange have widened more than ever before.  A by-product of this development has been an increase in the rural uptake of smartphones for various purposes, including agriculture. In this paper, I study the effects of exogenously created farmer-Whatsapp groups on agriculture outcomes, including yields, costs and response to weather and pest shocks. I also measure the effect of online interactions on farmer beliefs of willingness to exchange information with other farmers in-person versus over the phone. More specifically, by collecting data from a unique field experiment spanning 108 Indian villages, I test whether long-distant (online) connections lead to better diffusion of information and adoption of new agricultural technology by connecting farmers across space on several online groups. Due to the endogeneity of within-village networks, I randomize treatment at the village level, into two treatment interventions. In the first arm, farmers from non-neighboring villages are connected on twelve moderated Whatsapp groups (one group per 3 villages) to facilitate online information sharing of farming practices. In the second arm, along with the Whatsapp groups I also simulate in-person connections by inviting the Whatsapp group participants meet physically to discuss several farming related topics over lunch, and attend a poster-presentation. I then measure the differential effects of online farmer-interactions in these two types of groups. In addition, I track individual Whatsapp chat participation rates to test whether in-person interactions substitute or complement the online interactions. By facilitating online discussions on topics that are important to local farmers, I expect to see better agricultural outcomes for treated farmers. Preliminary analysis indicates that the mechanism through which this may happen is increasing willingness to exchange agriculture information with unknown farmers for treated groups."
