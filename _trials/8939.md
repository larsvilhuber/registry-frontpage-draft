abstract: "As part of their goal of providing innovative services to improve individuals’ lives after custody, the Lubbock County, Texas Detention Center operates the “Step-Up” program within their facility. Using a foundation of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), this program works with individuals through a curriculum that aims to reduce acts of violence and make substantive changes to a person’s behavior. Through a partnership between the Wilson Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunities and the Detention Center, this experimental research study will generate evidence of the impact of the Step-Up program on outcomes such as behavior within custody, longer-term recidivism, and workforce success."
