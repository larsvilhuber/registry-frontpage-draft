abstract: "Persistent gender inequalities in economic outcomes and leadership representation pose significant challenges, with women consistently earning less and being underrepresented in senior roles. Recent research suggests that differences in behavioral traits, particularly the willingness to compete, may contribute to these disparities. Earlier findings have shown that women are less likely to opt for competitive payment schemes, a tendency that may hinder their career progression and contribute to the wage gap. This project introduces an innovative approach to examine interventions that could mitigate the gender competitiveness gap. By employing an Outside Option treatment alongside the traditional tournament entry choices, we aim to explore the effects of providing participants with the flexibility to revise their payment choices after task completion. We aim to enhance our understanding of gender dynamics in competitive environments and discover potential strategies to promote gender equality in economic and professional settings."
