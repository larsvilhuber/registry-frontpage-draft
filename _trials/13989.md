abstract: "This study seeks to advance our understanding of labor market discrimination by disentangling whether preferences by employers, co-workers, or customers may drive discrimination against sexual and gender minority individuals in the workplace. We partner with a local firm to recruit a large, nationally representative sample of individuals in Chile. We exploit an incentivized, double list experiment designed to elicit preferences free of social desirability bias. Additionally, the experiment is complemented with a real-stakes decision problem to address hypothetical bias. Specifically, participants can choose to donate their earnings from the study to a charitable organization with a mission to improve the welfare of sexual and/or gender minorities in Chile. Additionally, we compare findings from the list experiment with responses from direct questions to estimate the size of the social desirability bias. Lastly, we will conduct heterogeneity analyses by socio-economic variables, demographics, and employment status among other characteristics."
