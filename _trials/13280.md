abstract: "This study tests the effectiveness of an informational intervention on young Tunisian adults' attitudes towards organ donation and their willingness to register as deceased organ donors. The study is being conducted in collaboration with the Tunisian Center for the Promotion of Organ Transplantation (CNPTO). We will randomly assign classrooms of undergraduate students to a treatment and control condition. The treatment classes will be visited by a representative of the CNPTO who will explain the medical and social significance of organ donation. She will also explain that Islam endorses organ donation as an act of generosity towards others. We will assess the effectiveness of this informational intervention on a set of outcomes which are self-reported by the studentsin an online survey: willingness to become organ donors, knowledge about the medical and administrative procedures, and trust in medical institutions."
