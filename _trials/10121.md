abstract: "This pre-analysis plan describes a follow-up survey experiment to a study registered as AEARCTR-0007596. In this pre-analysis plan, we describe a new survey experiment that builds on the findings from that previous survey experiment (conducted in 2021). The new survey experiment will cover 12,000 German respondents and include the “Efficiency” and the “Displacement” treatments. In addition, the new survey experiment will include a composite treatment combining these two treatments. Moreover, in addition to the main outcome question used in the 2021 survey to elicit attitudes towards the Berlin rent cap, the new survey will include an incentivized donation question and an open-ended question."
