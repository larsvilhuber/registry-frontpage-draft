abstract: "The Ifaa program, implemented by Catholic Relief Services, will provide an integrated set of complementary activities and services aimed at improving the lives of poor rural households who participate in Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP). The primary objective of the evaluation will be to measure the impact of the Ifaa program on food security, livelihoods, nutrition, and related outcomes in targeted communities. The proposed evaluation will contribute to a growing literature analyzing the effect of multifaceted interventions aimed to graduate poor households out of poverty. The study will use a cluster randomized control design whereby 120 kebeles will be randomly assigned to either receive the Basic PSNP package or the Ifaa enhanced package. "
