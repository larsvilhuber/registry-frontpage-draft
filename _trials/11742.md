abstract: "How does the proliferation of Native American representation impact local culture and attitudes towards Native Americans? Theories of cultural exposure suggest that more interactions with unfamiliar cultures can, under the right conditions, lead to increased tolerance. Existing evidence suggests that, in several contexts, direct contact with diverse people can change people's preferences and beliefs. However, much of the representation of Native American people and culture in the United States has been appropriated by Euro-American people and influences. This project seeks to understand how the presence of Native American representation, and the degree to which the representation is authentic or appropriated, affects attitudes towards and beliefs about Native Americans."
