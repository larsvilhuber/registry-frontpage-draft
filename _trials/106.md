abstract: "Internet-based sexual education could help reduce risky sexual behavior among adolescents. Across public junior high schools in 21 Colombian cities, we conducted a randomized evaluation of a mandatory six-month internet-based sexual education course. Six months after finishing the course, we find a 0.4 standard deviation improvement in knowledge, a 0.2 standard deviation improvement in attitudes, and a nine percentage point increase in likelihood of redeeming vouchers for condoms. We find no evidence of spillovers to control classrooms within treatment schools, although treatment effects are enhanced when a larger share of a student's friends also takes the course."
