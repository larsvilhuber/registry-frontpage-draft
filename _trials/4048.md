abstract: "In 2015, the Participation Act introduced a new law on income and participation in the Netherlands. The law was intended to implement more decentralized policy and municipalities are expected to take local circumstances into account during implementation. Nevertheless, a number of municipalities found that the implementation of the law was still not flexible enough and have submitted a request to the national Ministry of Social Affairs to experiment for 2 years with a more flexible implementation of the law. Deventer, a city with around 100.000 inhabitants in the eastern part of the country, is one of them. Under the title "What works on the way to work?" some of those entitled to social assistance are guided differently Approximately 400 of the 2400 people who meet the inclusion criteria are followed in 4 different ways for 2 years. One group becomes an intensive treatment, one group intensive digital treatment, one group less intensive treatment with much room for own initiative and for one controlgroup itÂ´s business as usual. A group of 200 other persons will be administratively followed. Tthe objective of the experiment and research is to research which approach leads the most to paid work, but also to, for example, voluntary work or training. We also look at effects on themes such as health and well-being. The study is set up as a randomized controlled trial running from October 2017 till October 2019.
