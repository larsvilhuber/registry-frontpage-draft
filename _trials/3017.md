abstract: "We conduct an experiment in the context of a protest in Berlin on May 27th 2018. For this date, the right-conservative German party "Alternative f√ºr Deutschland" (AfD) planned a protest. Several organizations and political parties tried to mobilize their followers to rally in a counter-protest.

In the experiment we leverage differing expert opinions to exogenously shift potential protesters' beliefs about the protest turnout for both sides.  We then study how the exogenous shift in beliefs affects supporters willingness to turn out at one of these protests."
