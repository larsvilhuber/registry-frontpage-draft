abstract: "The Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP) is a government-funded program for all permanent visa holders and some temporary visa holders who have less than a vocational level of English. Not all people who are eligible for the AMEP participate in it. The Department of Home Affairs commissioned BETA to evaluate the effectiveness of communication in participantsâ€™ home languages on increasing participation in the AMEP. We will conduct two simultaneous trials to test communications with students who have disengaged from the AMEP and those who have yet to enrol."
