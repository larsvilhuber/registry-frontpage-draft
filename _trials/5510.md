abstract: "In the presence of imperfectly observed quality, a market breakdown can occur in which sellers of high-quality products do not find it profitable to remain in the market. Such market dynamics can affect both buyers and sellers, but little research has explored these dynamics empirically, particularly in developing county settings where substandard and counterfeit goods have been reported to be widespread in numerous industries. In this project, we study the market for an important productive input – hybrid maize seeds. We study whether an information campaign to improve Kenyan farmers’ ability to detect seed quality and empower then to obtain recourse can: (1) increase usage of techniques to verify quality, (2) increase adoption of quality-verified products, (3) increase product quality and profitability at firms in the local market, and (4) improve agricultural outcomes. The information campaign is to be randomized across small rural markets in Western Kenya. Findings will provide direct evidence for an intervention relevant for boosting yields of a staple crop crucial for food security. We also aim to provide generalizable lessons on the role of information asymmetry in a market as a barrier to the adoption of productive inputs."
