abstract: "In many settings male students outperform females in mathematics, and furthermore, there appear to be a systematic difference in the way males and females approach mathematics tasks. This may be due to student factors (e.g. differences in preferences, personality, or ability) or teacher factors (e.g. gender stereotypes or didactic approaches). We focus on the role of teachers in fostering this gender gap. We carry out a conjoint experiment testing whether mathematics teachers believe that—all else being equal—male students benefit more from certain didactic approaches compared to females, and if such biases can be explained by teachers’ gender stereotypes or didactic approaches."
