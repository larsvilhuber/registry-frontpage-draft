abstract: "Social conformity and information-based herding have been studied extensively in the social sciences, but there is little experimental evidence on the relationship between task importance and herd formation.  In the upcoming experiment, we aim to replicate  the main findings of a previous experiment on herd behavior, using some minor design tweaks, to both ensure the robustness of our prior work and to more explicitly test (in a pre-registered manner) some hypotheses motivated by exploratory findings from our previous study."
