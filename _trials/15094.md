abstract: "Increasing the number of Small Medium Enterprises that have formal bank loans is of a primary policy concern to the government of Pakistan. Equilibrium levels of formal bank lending are very low for two main reasons: (a) high equilibrium interest rates on loans (~50% APR) with residential property collateral requirements and (b) inefficient credit markets due to information asymmetryâ€”SME bankers reported during exploratory fieldwork that low proliferation of credit scores coupled with unreliable auditing in Pakistan makes evaluating SME loan applications very difficult. These two inefficiencies result in high levels of relationship lending in both the formal and informal marketplace for business loans. The State Bank of Pakistan (Central Bank) frequently offers lending schemes specifically aimed at increasing the amount of money lent to formally registered SMEs. Such schemes remove collateral requirements and reduce interest rates to extremely favorable rates (~9% APR).  However, less than 3% of SMEs apply for bank loans per year (World Bank Enterprise Survey 2022). This project attempts to decompose the low levels of demand for formal business loans for the remaining 97% of tax paying SMEs by running a randomized control trial in partnership with the Small Medium Enterprise Development Authority of Pakistan (SMEDA)."
