abstract: "In this laboratory experiment, we intend to analyze how work arrangements that couple employee autonomy and performance incentives affect occupational stress. According to the Job Demand-Control model (Karasek, 1979, Administrative Science Quarterly, p. 285-308), individuals may experience detrimental health effects when job demands are not met by a sufficient level of decision latitude (i.e., autonomy). Yet, it is not clear whether granting autonomy to employees who face incentivized performance targets may impair their well-being. In such incentive schemes, autonomy, e.g., in terms of self-determined working time, could induce workers who strive for reaching their performance goals to provide effort beyond an optimal level. This effect should be particularly pronounced if individuals face uncertainty about the level of their performance. We use a real-effort task in a laboratory setting, in which we manipulate the extent of autonomy, certainty, and incentives, to analyze which working conditions are perceived as particularly stressful.
