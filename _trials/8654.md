abstract: "There are sizable gaps on indicators of human capital between the caste groups in India. Evidence suggests that such gaps, in part at least, are affected by discriminatory attitudes of school teachers towards students from the group called the Scheduled Castes. Our study intends to provide evidence on the prevalence of discriminatory attitudes a large sample of school teachers from India. We then design a treatment to mitigate discrimination that operate through empathy towards the schedule castes. "
