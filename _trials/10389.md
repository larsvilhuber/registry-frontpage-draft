abstract: "We examine whether the sustainable character of an investment impacts asset prices. We use experimental markets with the structure introduced by Smith, Suchanek, and Williams (1988) to investigate the impact of sustainable attributes. Empirical evidence suggests that investors experience positive emotions when choosing a sustainable investment and that positive emotions correlate with purchases and overpricing. We analyze investors' emotions using a face-reading software and posit that a high sustainability level leads to positive emotions and price increases. Conversely, a low sustainability level is associated with fear and, thus, price decreases. Moreover, we test how participantsâ€™ sustainability preferences influence their trading behavior."
