abstract: "We present here an extension of our experiment (entitled “How Unequal Wages, Unfair Procedures and Discrimination Affect Labor Supply: Experimental Evidence” in the AEA RCT Registry (ID: AEARCTR-0002655)). Our research is extended on two fronts: (1) negative gender discrimination without chances involved, and (2) positive gender discrimination of women without chances involved. We investigate the causal effect of wage inequality due to gender discrimination on labor supply decisions of workers. We conduct an experiment on an online platform, where workers individually engage in the same task and are individually paid a piece-rate wage. Workers receive information about their own wage and the wage of another worker as well as on the procedure leading to these wages. A worker’s labor supply decision only affects himself or herself. Providing less labor reduces the worker’s earnings but leaves unaffected the other workers’ earnings."
