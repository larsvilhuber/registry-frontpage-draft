abstract: "Reminders can be effective, low-cost behavioral interventions for encouraging individuals to take action. In a controlled field experiment, we analyze the effects of different reminders on individual’s recycling behavior (i.e. returning plastic bags). We cooperate with a food-boxes provider that offers clients weekly compilations of seasonal, biological products. Several vegetables within the food-boxes are delivered in plastic bags. While customers have the possibility and are encouraged to return the plastic bags for reuse ("recycle"), there is currently a low return rate of plastic bags. As behavioral interventions, we investigate the impact of close-to-the-action reminders and of conventional reminders on recycling behavior, relative to a control treatment where no reminders are present. A close-to-the-action reminder is understood and designed as a reminder which catches people’s attention in the situation and at the time of taking action. In our case, this is the moment of deciding whether to discard or return a plastic bag for reuse. "
