abstract: "I conduct an online laboratory experiment with Prolific and Qualtrics to evaluate whether blind grading on online platforms like Canvas might promote grade equity. I report the average impact on grade gaps by race and gender and the underlying behaviors that drive those gaps. In particular, I measure information seeking, time spent grading, order effects, and self-reported ratings. Motivated by rational inattention theory consistent with a Bayesian learning model with costly signal extraction, this experiment provides empirical evidence on whether statistical discrimination and endogenous inattention can explain grade differences."
