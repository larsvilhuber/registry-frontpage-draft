abstract: "This study will use low-end smartphones to adapt and deliver a tailored psychological therapy, Behavioural Activation among adolescents (15 to 19 years old) with depression in rural South Africa. We will assess the feasibility, acceptability, and determine the preliminary efficacy of the intervention (primary objective). As a secondary objective, we will pilot a range of mental health, social-affective cognition, risky behaviours, and socioeconomic measures; and collect descriptive data on trial procedures to inform key parameters in the development of a further large-scale trial."
