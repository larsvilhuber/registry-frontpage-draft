abstract: "Effective leadership stands out as a key driver of organizational performance, but we know little about how to select the best leaders. We use a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to explore this question in a real-world, high-stakes public sector context. This project investigates how to select ‘Champions’ among midwives to lead the implementation of a new obstetric triage programme (OTIP). Given that the current management-led selection might miss opportunities to leverage peer networks, which is crucial for OTIP, we study if a bottom-up selection approach, based on peers selecting champions, could be more effective to improve performance of frontline workers than a top-down approach. We use primary data from patients on service quality as key performance measures. To understand mechanisms, we survey midwives, using elicitation methods and cutting-edge lab-on-the-field experiments, and gather comprehensive peer network data."
