abstract: "My research objective is to examine how sharing information on social media impacts subsequent beliefs about that information. I aim to test the theory of Cognitive Dissonance - whether actions shape beliefs, and hypothesise that once people share information on their social media profile, they come to believe in it more strongly than they did before. I aim to conduct an online experiment with a large sample from India, which would involve a task of sharing information on Facebook and subsequent measurement of beliefs about the veracity of that information. This research has important policy relevance as the insights can extend an understanding of how the simple act of sharing unverified information itself could contribute to the prevalence of unsubstantiated beliefs, with serious consequences for individual well-being."
