abstract: "We examine in how far the elicitation procedure of the Minimum Acceptable Probability (MAP) used by Bohnet and Zeckhauser (2004) is influenced by the presentation of the probability distribution of the winning probability. Should the distribution have an influence on participants’ MAP, this is evidence that was has been called ‘betrayal aversion’ in previous studies is (partly) due to factors other than an anticipated disutility of betrayal."
