abstract: "A third generation, premium female condom called the Maximum Diva Woman’s condom will be marketed in Lusaka, Zambia in November 2015. The Maximum Diva Woman’s Condom is a new type of female condom that provides non-hormonal protection against unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. With the introduction of this new product, the question arises regarding whether the availability and promotion of the Maximum Diva Woman’s Condom will increase overall condom use. This study will evaluate the effect of introducing a new female condom to the Zambian market, a mass media campaign, and interpersonal communication intervention on the prevalence of female condom use and prevalence of overall condom use.

Specifically, the study will examine the effect of these two approaches on female and male condom use. We also will look at willingness to use, knowledge, attitudes and practice regarding female condoms. To understand the effect of interpersonal communication, the proposed study will gather information on communication with sexual partners. "
