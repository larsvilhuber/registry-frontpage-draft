abstract: "We study the medium term impacts of free access to day care on home resources, home environments, and child development. Applicants to public day care in Rio de Janeiro in 2008 were allocated to slots in public day care centers through a lottery. The lottery was binding when there was excess demand for slots in a particular age group - day care center combination. Data is collected in 2008, 2012, 2015 and 2017 on the labor supply and income of different household members, household expenditures, home environments, children's cognitive and non-cognitive skills, children's anthropometrics, and children's preferences."
