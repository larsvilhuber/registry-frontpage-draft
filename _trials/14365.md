abstract: "Participants in this experiment read the instructions of two different payment mechanisms from a past study. In the past study, subjects played a real-effort slider task in groups of two for four rounds, with their payment being determined by one of the two payment mechanisms. The first mechanism is a tournament that not only awards a higher prize to the winner, but also gives them more time in the next round, while the loser receives less. The second mechanism is a simple piece rate for the number of correctly placed sliders, with no time penalties and rewards. Participants in the current experiment are asked to rate the overall, outcome, and procedural fairness of these two payment mechanisms. At the end, we elicit their willingness to give up part of their fixed payment to make sure that the piece rate is implemented in a lab session, where participants will play the slider task. They are informed that the choice of a randomly drawn participant will be implemented. Half of the participants rating the mechanisms will also get the chance to be invited to these lab sessions."
