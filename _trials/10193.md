abstract: "We study how the provision of information about the legal ramifications and risks associated with a third-party guarantee for a loan affects an individual's willingness to grant such a guarantee. We examine how the effect varies with individuals' (i) expectations about loan default of the borrower and (ii) social preferences. The setting of the study is a survey experiment with a net sample of around 5,000 interviews that will be conducted online. The target population are adults living in the UK. Respondents are randomly assigned with equal probability to one of four different groups, a control group, a salience treatment group, and two salience-and-information treatment groups that differ in the information they are provided with."
