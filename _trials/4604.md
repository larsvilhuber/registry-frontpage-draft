abstract: "In this project, we study a new type of contribution to a (impure) public good, personal data. We do so in the context of a German online education platform, which provides free online courses for participants but lacks sufficient data about them to further improve their services. We design soft behavioral interventions that highlight higher benefits and lower costs of contribution. In one treatment, we increase the salience of the public benefit of personal data contributions for the whole user community. In the second treatment, we additionally highlight data protection standards, thereby reducing potentially overestimated privacy costs. If our intervention is effective, we plan to use machine learning methods to study whether our intervention indeed increases the quality of the public online education good. For example, we may explore whether a larger base of personal data generates more precise predictions of course-related outcomes such as drop-out and grades. "
