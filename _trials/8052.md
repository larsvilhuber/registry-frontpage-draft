abstract: "To encourage participation in local governance and increase tax compliance in Niger, an intervention providing information on municipality participative events and on how taxes are used is tested. An information dissemination campaign is implemented in a randomly selected group of villages to assess if information diffusion can be a useful tool to address the two aforementioned issues. We test two different interventions: i) tax base assessment tool for municipal government in low state capacity environment, and ii) basic information dissemination about taxes and local government affairs and augmented with social influence messages. In addition to local participation and tax compliance, we examine a range of other outcomes including trust and satisfaction with public services supply. "
