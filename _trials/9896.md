abstract: "There exist persistent gender gaps in financial knowledge, both over time and across countries. While many studies explore why women know less, these gaps might not only reflect differential knowledge but also differential behavior in the provision of an answer.  The gaps are measured by the number of correct answers. However, men might always offer an answer while women might prefer to say they “do not know” when not completely certain. This project tests this hypothesis and explores whether these gaps could be closed with simple nudges. We implement an online survey to 6,000 participants to test how gender gaps vary in “do not know” and correct answers. The survey randomizes the questionnaire format by using a standard financial literacy survey, with “do not know” options, by excluding these, incentivizing the correct answers and providing informational nudges."
