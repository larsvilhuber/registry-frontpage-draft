abstract: "Estimation of belief learning models relies on several assumptions regarding measurement errors. Whereas existing work has focused on classical measurement errors, the current project investigates the impact of a non-classical measurement error. In particular, we design an economics experiment to study the impact of rounding bias on belief updating."
