abstract: "This study explores how workers respond to reports about Social Security’s finances, using an online experiment where participants are shown identical articles with different headlines.  The first headline reports that Social Security has a “long-term financing shortfall,” but does not directly reference the trust fund.  The remaining three headlines highlight the depletion of the trust fund.  The second headline draws on language from the summary document accompanying the 2021 Trustees Report: “The Social Security Trust Fund Will Deplete its Reserves in 2034” (the projected depletion date in 2021 when this experiment was run).  The third mirrors recent media coverage: “Social Security Fund Headed toward Insolvency in 2034, Trustees Find.”  And the fourth emphasizes ongoing program revenue alongside the trust fund: “Revenues Projected to Cover Only 75 Percent of Scheduled Social Security Benefits After 2034.”

Participants were then asked about their expectations for the future: the level of benefits they expect to receive from Social Security, their planned claiming age, and how much they plan to save in their 401(k) or IRA.  The analysis compares these expectations across the four headlines.
