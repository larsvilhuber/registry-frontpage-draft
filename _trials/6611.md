abstract: "This study is twofold. First we add to the discussion about the effectiveness of food-vouchers. Second, we contribute to the literature about the impact of information and labelling as part of social aid programs. To answer both questions we randomly allocate households with children beneficiaries of the Georgian Targeted Social Assistance (TSA) program in four arms. These households receive a monthly transfer per household member (adults and children) and an additional support per child. In our study some households received part of their monthly transfer as a food voucher, some households receive an SMS describing the size of the child benefit, some households will receive the voucher and the SMS and other households receive the monthly transfer only in cash.

Our results aim to provide evidence about the effect differential effect of vouchers and labeled transfer in order to increase children's and households welfare.  "
