abstract: "Reducing post-harvest storage losses creates opportunities for smallholder households to increase incomes and food security. Hermetic storage bags, which are locally produced and cost-effective, have been demonstrated to significantly minimize storage losses. However, adoption of these bags remains low among smallholders, despite their proven benefits and relatively low cost. This project aims to analyse the role of potential adoption barriers relating to farmerâ€™s (i) financial constraints and (ii) liquidity constraints, as well as iii) to what extent smallholders who have already tested hermetic harvest bags in a prior project phase (and are thus better able to weigh up the advantages and costs) are more willing to invest in new harvest bags than smallholders who have not yet been able to test harvest bags."
