abstract: "In the last few years, Colombia has seen a wave of migrants entering the country from Venezuela (more than four million have entered the country and 1.4 million have stayed in the country by the end of 2019.) This adds to the number of internally displaced people, victims of the civil conflict who also usually live in poor conditions and in the poorest areas of the big cities, as well as former combatants of the FARC and paramilitaries that have rejoined civilian life. The presence of migrants and former combatants in the cities, together with the fact that interpersonal trust in Colombia is very low, led to the question of what impact does their presence has on people’s levels of trust and their preferences for redistribution. We are implementing a lab-in-the-field experiment with a representative sample in Bogotá to measure prosocial behavior (such as preferences for redistribution) and trust among Colombian citizens and four groups: Venezuelan migrants, former combatants, internally displaced people and the very poor. This will allow us to study whether how much Colombians trust Venezuelan migrants compares to how much they trust other migrants (such as internally displaced people) or other poor people (that are Colombian.) It will also allow us to study how trust in former combatants compares to another group that is connected to the Colombian civil conflict, which is internally displaced people, most of whom are victims of the civil conflict and were forced to flee their homes and move to the cities (such as Bogotá.) We use one intervention to test a mechanism that can explain and increase interpersonal trust: an improvement in empathy levels among citizens towards the target groups via videos of them (former combatants and Venezuelan migrants).
