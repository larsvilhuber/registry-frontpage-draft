abstract: "We investigate the mismatch between the skills that employers demand and the ones that workers have in the Saudi Arabia labor market. This mismatch is especially emphasized in soft skills. This study will investigate two behavioral factors as possible barriers to invest in soft skills for university students. One factor is the lack of information about the importance of these soft skills. The second factor is the lack of these soft skills, because investing in these skills is often non-mandatory and is left at the discretion of students. To investigate these channels we will use standard experimental methods as well as survey methods and measure students' soft skills. We will randomly provide students with the results of a survey about the most important soft skills in the workplace and we will examine the effect of the information intervention on investment in soft skills and academic outcomes. We will also measure participants' perceptions about labor market and motherhood-related issues."
