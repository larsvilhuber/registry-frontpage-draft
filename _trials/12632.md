abstract: "Despite being a top concern for global welfare, policymakers have struggled to implement taxes to address climate change. This has led to an increasing reliance on voluntary actions taken by firms and consumers to combat carbon emissions. In this paper, I experimentally test a non-standard policy that publicizes voluntary consumer carbon mitigation, leveraging social rewards to increase uptake. Specifically, I show that posting names of carbon offset purchasers online is an effective tool to encourage voluntary carbon mitigation, as confirmed by experimentally estimated demand curves. Further, I show that social rewards vary heavily by perceived market penetration of offsets. Uptake increases vastly among those with the lowest perceptions of carbon offset market penetration but is only slightly impacted among those with moderate perceptions. I then estimate a structural model of demand for prosocial actions in the face of social rewards to understand the implications of my findings on optimal subsidy policy. To avoid crowding out social incentives, I show that optimal subsidies for consumer carbon mitigation technologies should start out small at low participation rates and ramp up as these technologies become more common.
