abstract: "This trial investigates the effect of leader incentives on the performance of teams. In collaboration with a medium-sized Latin-American bank, we engineered a field experiment by designing a series of contests among the bank branches, in which we varied the prize structure of the tournaments (in some tournaments, the prizes were shared among all branch employees, while in other tournaments there was an additional prize for the branch manager).
