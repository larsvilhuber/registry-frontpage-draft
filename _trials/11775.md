abstract: "In Japan, the per capita vegetable intake for adults is about 280g, falling short of the 350g target. Continued inadequate vegetable intake increases the risk of lifestyle-related diseases such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and arteriosclerosis. The purpose of this study is to implement a commitment intervention that will allow Japanese consumers to determine their target vegetable intake and to examine ways to increase vegetable intake. 
The survey will measure the fruit and vegetable intake of approximately 2,000 civil servants working for Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, and asking approximately 1,000 randomly selected participants from the measured population to fill in a target for fruit and vegetable intake one month later. They were then asked to measure their fruit and vegetable intake one month later to confirm changes in intake. Based on the results, we propose measures to increase fruit and vegetable intake in Japan.
To measure fruit and vegetable intake, we used a vegetable intake measuring instrument (Veggie Meter®, Longevity Link Corporation) (Redtke et al.), which can measure carotenoids in the blood without contact.
