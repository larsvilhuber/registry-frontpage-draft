abstract: "Despite a long-standing expectation that trade politics in the US had become a non-partisan affair, the 2016 presidential election witnessed a collapse of support for free trade among Republican voters.  While some current work suggests that this was the result of either simple elite cuing, or of rising "nationalist" populism on the right, we demonstrate that these accounts overlook a crucial value that mediated the effectiveness of Trump's narrative about trade as an assault on the American Dream:  meritocracy.  Americans who believe that the (domestic) market in the US is fair---particularly those facing economic anxiety themselves---were especially primed to respond to Trump's explanation that recent economic frustration was due to an unfair international playing field."
