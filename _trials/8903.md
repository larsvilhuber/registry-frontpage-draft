abstract: "Around the world, laws limit incentives for transactions such as human research participation, egg donation, or gestational surrogacy. A key reason is the notion of undue inducement---the conceptually vague and empirically largely untested idea that incentives cause harm by distorting individual decision making. Two experiments, including one based on a highly visceral transaction, show that incentives bias information search. Such behavior is consistent with both irrational and  Bayes-rational behavior. I examine whether choices admit welfare weights on benefit and harm that justify permitting the transaction but capping incentives."
