abstract: "Recent literature has shown the effect of inherited or assigned identity on economic behavior and human decision making in general. We investigate if priming an aspired (or rejected) identity has an influence on real effort provision (learning a language). Additionally, we will analyze the effect of both loss- and gain-framed identity primes on the learning behavior in a language learning application. In our setting, we prime newly arrived migrants on the host country's identity either with a loss or a gain framing. We analyze the effect of the different primes on the language app's utilization with a number of different parameters tracked by the app. "
