abstract: "Researchers often rely on data from voluntary (online) surveys, for instance, to investigate effects on outcomes that are not available in administrative data (e.g., well-being and non-cognitive skills) or to study potential mechanisms that drive effects (e.g., behavioral changes may occur due to an update of individuals’ beliefs). However, survey response rates are often low, which reduces the statistical power of subsequent analyses. In addition, survey participation may be selective, which can affect nonresponse bias. Using a large sample of university students, we investigate if social norms can be used to increase participation rates and to reduce the nonresponse bias in a voluntary online survey."
