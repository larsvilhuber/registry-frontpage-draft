abstract: "This study is driven by the implications of the recent MIFID II regulation, which requires financial advisors to consider their clients' sustainability preferences and tailor investment recommendations accordingly. The central aim of our research is to examine the extent to which MIFID II allows for motivated reasoning when selecting sustainable investments. Specifically, we investigate if investors' assessment of sustainability criteria is influenced by the potential for financial gains. We conduct an incentivized online experiment on Prolific with 800 participants. Our results shed light on the effectiveness of the MIFID II regulation in capturing sustainability preferences."
