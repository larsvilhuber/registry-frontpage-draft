abstract: "This project will study voter opinion on congestion pricing using an information intervention combined with a policy introduction. Respondents in the region of a proposed congestion price will be asked their opinions on the policy before the policy is introduced. This pre-policy survey will include an information intervention; treated respondents will receive information related to congestion pricing, and the study will test the effect of this information on their likelihood of supporting the policy. After congestion pricing is introduced, respondents will be surveyed again to see how opinions change."
