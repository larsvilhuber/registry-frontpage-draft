abstract: "Traffic congestion is a difficult problem faced by urban management all over the world. This experiment investigates how to encourage commuters to drive cars in non-peak hours. We organize a randomized field experiment to explore the effectiveness of different treatments: tradable permits, congestion charges, and health information. We define the time window of 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. as the big peak hours. and before 6:30 a.m. or after 8:30 a.m. as the small peak hours. Under the tradable permits, drivers' app accounts will be deducted for some tickets if they depart during peak hours. Under congestion charges, drivers' app accounts will be deducted some money if they depart during peak hours. The drivers in health information group will receive reminder messages every week. In the last group, drivers will be influenced by health information and congestion charges.
