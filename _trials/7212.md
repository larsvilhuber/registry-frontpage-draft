abstract: "Abstract This study documents the impacts of a women's entrepreneurship program on intrahousehold dynamics and decision-making. Through a spousal survey and a series of lab in the field games between spouses, we seek to understand how a program designed to promote women's entrepreneuship changes women's barganing power, how the additional income earned by the woman gets allocated within the household, and whether the program is effective at reducing intrahoushold conflict. In addition, we provide descriptive evidence on which women select into the program."
