abstract: "The study focuses on adoption of eco-schemes (ES) by French farmers. Eco-schemes are new payment schemes for care for the environment and climate which are funded by the European Common Agricultural Policy. Each Member State must propose one or more ES, and farmers have the freedom to participate or not. Here, we propose behavioral interventions aiming at increasing adoption of ES by French farmers. It has been shown that farmers’ decisions to adopt sustainable practices seem to be influenced by their neighbors’ behavior.  Our strategy to encourage farmers to adopt ES is then to make more salient social norms of adoption among farmers. To this end we implement a large-scale web survey where French farmers are proposed to adopt two different hypothetical ES: one aiming at compensating farmers who voluntarily dedicate a part of their land to protect biodiversity, and one aiming at compensating farmers who voluntarily reduce the use of crop protection products. Farmers will be randomly assigned to four different informational treatments in which we will vary the reference to the social norm in terms of farmer adoption.  "
