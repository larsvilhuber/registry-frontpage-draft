abstract: "Forest communities often lack income opportunities that do not degrade the environment. Eco-tourism is presented as an economic activity that could reduce poverty and protect the forests. However, additional income could increase the demand for forest intensive products. To assess what happens empirically, we randomize municipalities into an eco-tourism enhancement strategy to evaluate the possible effects on household income and forest conservation. We rely on household surveys for socio-economic variables and satellite data for forest measurement. We will initially measure the effects one year later, but it would be possible to assess long term effects later. "
