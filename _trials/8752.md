abstract: "Meat consumption is responsible for environmental (carbon emissions) ang health (cancers, cardio-vascular diseases, etc.) negative externalities. Using an online questionnaire, our first objective is to investigate consumers’ willingness to switch from beef hamburgers to plant-based vegetarian hamburgers, meat-like hamburgers or cultured meat hamburgers. This first objective is therefore a replication of Carlsson et al. (2021)’s study.
Second, and contrary to Carlsson et al. (2021)’s study, our second objective is to investigate, using treatments, the potential of mental accounting (informing consumers about the carbon footprint of each type of hamburger) to foster the adoption of meat substitutes.
