abstract: "The key idea of our research project is – “How can knowledge of analytics have an impact on small scale entrepreneurs and their business?” Specifically, we seek to improve the growth of small firms in emerging markets by addressing a significant constraint they face: access to marketing information & marketing analytics. Few micro and small enterprises formally record their marketing data (e.g. sales, products, customers) which hampers their ability to extract meaningful insights from business information. The lack of knowledge of metrics and analytics (business intelligence) needed to use business information, limits firms’ ability to overcome constraints or take advantage of opportunities. Our research uses a randomized controlled field experiment (RCFE) to measure the impact on business performance of an easy-to-use, mobile app-based information and analytics tool (conceptualized by us) that increases an entrepreneur’s ability to track, access and take actions on key marketing information. Our aim is to better understand the role of marketing information and analytics in improving firms’ ability to derive useful insights. We also intend to study how it can be used to change the mind-set of the entrepreneurs and unlock the potential of emerging-market enterprises in a cost-effective, scalable way.
