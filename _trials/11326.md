abstract: "Pay inequality within companies is rising in modern economies. We design a lab and online experiment to examine team performance when leaders outearn their team members. We show that pay inequality causally undermines the ability of leaders to coordinate their teams (via leading by example), causing bad team performance despite aligned financial incentives. We then study whether exposing leaders to higher risk—measured by the cost they suffer when the team performs poorly—can justify inequality. We find that increased leader risk raises the perceived legitimacy of pay inequality. Remarkably, leaders anticipate the teams’ greater willingness to follow, which is necessary for teams to do well."
