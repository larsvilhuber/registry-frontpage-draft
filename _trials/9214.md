abstract: "While enrollment in secondary school has increased significantly in the past 20 years, net enrollment rates remain below 70% in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (UNESCO Institute for Statistics, 2021). Factors such as engagement in paid work and early marriage draw adolescents away from schooling during these critical years of development. In Bangladesh, where a reverse gender-gap in enrollment has emerged in recent years at both the primary and early secondary levels, gender inequities remain in the intrahousehold allocation of educational resources, with boys receiving greater investment in the quality of schooling (Xu, Sonchoy, and Fujii, 2022). Furthermore, at the secondary level, dropout rates among girls outpace boys at 42% compared to 33% (GIRL Center Research Brief, 2020; BANBEIS 2018). Furthermore, recent school closures due to the covid-19 pandemic threaten to undo progress in enrollment and widen disparities in investment, especially for girls and those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Adolescents in LMICs are disproportionately affected due to longer durations of school closures and lower access to distance learning modalities (World Bank, 2020; Baird et al., 202), and adolescents in Bangladesh are among the most negatively affected globally, with complete school closures that lasted 63 weeks. 

We are piloting evidence-based approaches among adolescents in Bangladesh to promote re-enrollment, increase secondary school completion, and promote gender equitable behavior. This research evaluates, through a school-based cluster Randomized Controlled Trial (cRCT) with 109 schools, two interventions that were virtually-delivered during covid-19-related school closures: (1) a gender-neutral Growth Mindset (GM) programming around malleable intelligence and (2) Girl Rising (GR) programming that focuses on gender norms around girlsâ€™ education that is layered on top of the GM programming. We layer GR on GM in order to test whether programming that speaks particularly to the constrains faced by adolescent girls has additional positive impacts on adolescent outcomes.
