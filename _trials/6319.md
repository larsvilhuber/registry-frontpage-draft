abstract: "A deeper understanding of individual behavior that determines the voluntary provision of environmental public goods is of special importance for climate action where decentralized informal institutions like societal norms and values gain momentum. For achieving the 2°C global temperature target, IPCC scenarios suggest net-zero emissions by around 2050. So far, the experimental literature on individual climate change efforts focuses on the underlying individual willingness-to-pay for CO2 mitigation. As novelty, we investigate voluntary contributions to a negative emission technology in form of a local forest carbon sink. We conduct a framed-field experiment highlighting not only the climate impact, but also the role of local ancillary benefits resulting from the provision of a local forest carbon sink and the importance of the spatial dimension.
