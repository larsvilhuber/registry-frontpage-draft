abstract: "Economic growth and inflow of capital in Southeast Asia has established the service sector as a primary job creator for women and, thus, means to promote formal female labor participation (FLFP). However, the service sector’s close ties to the sex trade continue to present these women with high-risk, informal income-generating opportunities, most notably through risky paid sex like condomless sex or sex with high-risk partners. While literature has illustrated the positive relationship between FLFP and common economic development indicators (Heath and Jayachandran, 2018) and common poverty alleviation interventions have been tested to decrease the incentives for women to supply sex (Jones and Gong, 2021; Gong et al., 2019), this study will investigate the interaction between FLFP and the market for sex by assessing how women tradeoff between these two types of labor. Using data from a cluster RCT enrolling Cambodian female service workers, we will study the effects of offering service work incentives on women’s risk-taking via measuring impacts to labor supply choices and earnings (service, sex, vs. other work), health outcomes (HIV and other STI results), and financial conditions."
