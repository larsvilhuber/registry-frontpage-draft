abstract: "In recent years, new literature has emerged within economics that points toward a change in behavior when people make decisions for others compared to a situation where they decide for themselves. In the sphere of moral behavior, it has been shown that individuals decide less pro-social when acting on behalf of others and that they receive less blame for taking unfair or immoral decisions.  In this project, the effect of intermediaries, defined as decision-makers who act on behalf of others, on discrimination is investigated. "
