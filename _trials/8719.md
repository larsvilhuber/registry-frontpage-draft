abstract: "The determinants of unemployment in France are numerous, but a well-known cause is the presence of frictions in the labor market. Many frictions are related to informational imperfections, due to the cost of collecting, processing and disseminating information. These imperfections are one of the reasons why job seekers are offered job vacancies which are not entirely suitable for them and may remain unemployed for a long time whereas there are vacancies they would have liked more and to which they could apply.

This experiment consists in asking job seekers to assign a weight to each of the job search criteria (occupation targeted, distance from home, salary, type of contract and working hours) that reflects their preferences, in order to make them more accurate vacancies recommendations regarding their own concerns, through a personalized version of the Pôle emploi (the French public employment service) recommendation algorithm. We will then study extensively their job search behaviour and their return to employment in order to measure the benefits of such intervention."
