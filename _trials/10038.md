abstract: "We examine how students' perceptions change about the course subject when students are randomly assigned to an early morning (7:30 AM) and a non-early morning classes in a public university in the U.S. Our hypothesis is that students may have a stronger negative feelings about the course material when they are assigned to an early morning class than those who are not because of attribution bias.
