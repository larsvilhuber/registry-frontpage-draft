abstract: "There is compelling evidence that investments in adolescent girl’s education, labor force participation, fertility choices, employment opportunities, health-seeking behavior have positive impacts on the girl’s lives. Girls with higher levels of education, make better sexual and reproductive health decisions, they are also more likely to earn a better income and less likely to marry early. Adolescent girls in the refugee and host populations in Uganda face a multiple issues regarding Sexual and reproductive health, teenage pregnancy, early school drop-out and lack of economic empowerment. The aim of this study is to assess if an intervention, targeted towards increasing awareness about improved sexual and reproductive healthcare practices coupled with life skills training among adolescent girls and young mothers, helps in enhancing their knowledge about the sexual and reproductive health, value of education, business and finance, reduction in teenage pregnancy and improving life expectations. The study aims to employ the method of randomized encouragement design, encouraging girls in the treatment group to participate in the intervention while the girls in the control group will not be receiving the encouragement.
