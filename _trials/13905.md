abstract: "This paper examines the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in facilitating the non-judicial collection process of delinquent consumer debt. Leveraging a randomized field experiment in the Netherlands, we show that algorithmic calling decisions achieve higher repayment rates with fewer collection calls compared with human collection officers. Uncovering the black box of AI, we find that it extracts predictive signals from unstructured notes compiled by collectors. These signals not only predict whether the delinquent borrowers would repay during the non-judicial collection process, but also shed light on the underlying motivations or impediments of delinquent borrowers' repayment behavior."
