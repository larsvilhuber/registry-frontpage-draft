abstract: "If employers hold biased beliefs about a particular group, they may be less likely to hire workers from this group, preventing them from learning and correcting their beliefs. This paper explores whether temporary affirmative action can correct biased beliefs and in turn improve representation even after the policy is lifted. I elicit employer hiring decisions and beliefs about potential employee performance in two between-subject experimental treatments: a control treatment without affirmative action and a temporary affirmative action treatment."
