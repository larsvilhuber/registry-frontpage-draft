abstract: "This study explores how a non-violent ethnic movementâ€™s involvement in governance-like functions influences public trust and support, particularly in contexts where the state is perceived as failing to provide these functions. The trial focuses on mining workers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, and evaluates the impact of two informational interventions. Participants are randomly assigned to receive information about either (1) the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mines Safety, Inspection, and Regulation Act of 2019 (government intervention) or (2) a Pashtun Grand Jirga decision to oversee mining operations (social movement intervention), with a control group receiving no intervention. Outcomes include support for government and social movement figures, likelihood of reporting unsafe conditions, and confidence in reporting effectiveness. We hypothesize that the Jirga intervention will increase willingness to report to social movements and confidence in their effectiveness, while the government intervention will have little to no impact."
