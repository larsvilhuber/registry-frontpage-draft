abstract: "This project aims to answer the question of whether an accelerator business training program can catalyze entrepreneurship in Ghana.  We will conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of an accelerator business training program provided by the Innovation and Incubation Hub, a business incubator at the University of Ghana Business School (UGBS). University students will submit a business plan that will be assessed for feasibility. Applicants with feasible business plans will be randomly allocated to treatment and control groups. The training program will run for six months and contains modules on starting and running a business: developing a business idea and proposal, obtaining financing, financial management, and marketing strategies, as well as soft skills such as entrepreneurial mindsets, resilience, and entrepreneurial etiquette. After the training program, we will focus on the effects of the program on entrepreneurial traits and mindset, whether the applicant started the business, how long it took to start the business, attempts to secure funding for the business, sources of and amounts of funding secured, the main product or service offered by the business, and sales, costs, profitability and productivity of the business. We will also examine whether there is treatment effect heterogeneity by baseline characteristics. Because our sample includes university students from business schools in Ghana - UGBS, GIMPA Business School, and the University for Professional Studies, Accra (UPSA) - we will also shed light on the spillover effects of the program.
