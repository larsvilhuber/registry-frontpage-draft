abstract: "The high importance of career-oriented motivation within the group of young volunteers and the recent evidence that job references for volunteers can improve employment opportunities suggest that job references for volunteers can motivate young adults to participate in volunteer programs. We demonstrated this in our study, "The motivational effect of detailed job references for volunteers - Evidence from a field experiment on intergenerational cooperation" (https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/5688). We successfully tested a mechanism for detailed job references with performance information that outperformed a control group that received a simple job reference without performance information. As a next step, we aim to increase the quality of volunteer support by integrating online training with 5 modules before participants offer support to their mentees. With this approach, we are testing how to motivate younger citizens to participate in an online e-Learning program (e.g., through monetary incentives or volunteer job references) and how participation affects performance in an ongoing hands-on engagement."
