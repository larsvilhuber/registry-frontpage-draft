abstract: "We study the impact of financial incentive and its schemes on physical activity, or walking behavior. When receiving incentive, some people are motivated to increase their walking steps, while others may decrease them because of motivational crowding out. This study introduces two type of self-selective incentive schemes, opt-in and opt-out. Under the opt-in scheme, incentive is not provided by default, and people need to make a registration if they need it. In contrast, under the opt-out scheme, incentive is provided by default, and people need to cancel the incentive enrollment if they do not need it. We evaluate the average treatment effect of the two schemes on walking behavior, and investigate which scheme is more effective for providing incentive to the people who increase their steps by receiving the incentive."
