abstract: "This study aims at understanding the price elasticity of demand for e-hailing services for first and last mile connectivity using a random sample of users of one of Brazil’s main e-hailing apps in Sao Paulo. Every day close to 21 million residents of the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Region (SPMR) make around 44 million trips, with the average trip in public transport lasting more than an hour. Mixing new transport technologies such as e-hailing apps with available public transit infrastructure is a possible sustainable solution to congestion in large cities like Sao Paulo. E-hailing apps can provide flexibility and on-demand services that can easily be combined with rapid mass public transportation. While the study focuses on understanding the price at which people are motivated to exchange a car-only trip for a car and metro one, it will also try elucidating how income-levels, gender and age affect these choices; and what complementary factors are part of the decisions (i.e. personal security, for instance). The study will provide unique evidence of the potential of e-hailing for first and last-mile connectivity across one of Latin America’s largest city."
