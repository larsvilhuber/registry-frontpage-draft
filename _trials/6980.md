abstract: "Misperceptions regarding the beliefs of peers may serve as a barrier preventing individuals from openly seeking advice regarding personal decisions. We study how these misperceptions may arise and how they may push society towards an inferior equilibrium. Using data from an experiment conducted with low-income individuals in New Delhi, India, we study how belief-shifting interventions can increase interpersonal dialogue."
