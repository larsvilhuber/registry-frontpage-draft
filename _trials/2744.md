abstract: "More than two of every five students who enroll in college fail to graduate within 6 years. Prior research has identified ineffective study habits as a major barrier to success. Using insights from behavioral economics, this study will assess whether focusing student attention on improving study habits can change behavior and improve outcomes. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial at Oregon State University to assess multiple interventions designed to overcome barriers to college completion. The interventions include encouragement to receive academic coaching on study strategies, to attend academic tutoring, and to increase study effort. We will also randomize the medium, timing, frequency, and offer of a lottery-based incentive for each encouragement, allowing us to measure how message delivery alters student behavior. Our findings will provide evidence on how to increase use of these services and the causal effects of these services."
