abstract: "Abstract
Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effects of point-light technique with action observation therapy (AOT) on muscle activation and coordination, upper extremity functions, and activities of daily living (ADL) in patients with stroke. 
Methods: Thirty-two patients with stroke were enrolled in the study. Sixteen underwent AOT using the point-light technique, while the other 16 underwent the traditional AOT. Both programs were five 30-minute sessions/week for 4 weeks. The upper extremity function was assessed using the Fuglâ€“Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity(FMA-UE), Action Research Arm Test, and Box and Block Test(BBT), while the ADL was assessed using the Korean Modified Barthel Index(K-MBI) and Motor Activity Log(MAL). Muscle activation and coordination were assessed using surface electromyography(sEMG).
Results: Both groups showed significant improvements in the upper extremity function, ADL, and muscle activation after the intervention (p<.05). The experimental group showed a significantly greater improvement in the upper extremity function, ADL, and muscle activation after the intervention compared to the control group (p<.05). Co-contraction ratio indicated positive changes in both shoulder and elbow joint movements in the experimental group but not in the control group. 
Conclusions: Point-light technique(PL-AOT) is more effective than traditional AOT in improving muscle activation and coordination, upper extremity function, and ADLs. "
