abstract: "A large Swiss pension fund is introducing a new digital pension application to help its insureds plan for retirement. The platform allows individuals to access personal information related to their occupational retirement account. Moreover, the digital pension application allows the insureds to initiate voluntary contributions to their retirement saving plan. In collaboration with the pension fund, we randomize different invitation letters across insureds to test (i) which aspects of the new platform are most important for the insureds and (ii) which behavioral barriers are relevant in the context of adopting and utelizing the digital pension application. We explore whether the different invitation letters affect the probability that individuals access the online platform, its usage, and retirement contribution behavior."
