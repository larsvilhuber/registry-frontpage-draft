abstract: "We conduct an online experiment where subjects make two types of choices: one involving monetary lotteries and another involving riskless alternatives, the values of which can be computed through simple mathematical operations. The objective of the study is to evaluate whether subjects display similar behaviors in these two environments and to understand why."
