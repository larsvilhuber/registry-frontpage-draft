abstract: "Candidates applying to the police force must pass various assessments to become eligible for the academy. After entering the process, there is drop-off at each stage. The large police department with which we work has a particularly substantial number of drop outs at the stage where candidates must submit a Personal History Statement (PHS) as part of the Background Investigation phase. In our randomized controlled trial, we administer a communications intervention to candidates, encouraging and reminding them to submit their PHS online. Candidates are randomized into treatment and control groups at the individual level, with the control group receiving the existing personnel department email regarding next steps. The treatment group receives a new email as well as a follow up text message reminding candidates to submit the PHS. We compare the yield rate and length of time from email to PHS submission to determine treatment effect. "
