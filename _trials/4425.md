abstract: "Encouraging Multilingual Early Reading as the Groundwork for Education (EMERGE) is a cluster-randomized evaluation of a program that provides Kenyan parents with illustrated childrenâ€™s storybooks and modified dialogic reading training. The ongoing study employs a 73-community cluster-randomized design to examine the impact of a cost-effective parent education and storybook distribution program on preschool-aged children in rural Kenya.  Within this main design, we use a within-cluster caregiver-level randomization to examine the impact of the language of the children's storybooks."
