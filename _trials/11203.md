abstract: "We've already found that shifting pronoun uses would affect people's economic decisions such as risk preference, time preference, and loss aversion. We are trying to investigate if pronoun shifting could impact people's other economic behaviors such as altruistic behavior, trust behavior, and inequality aversion. Also, we try to support our findings on loss aversion by using some famous hypothesized scenario tasks in addition to incentivized lottery tasks. "
