abstract: "Quality of products transacted within value chains, and the preservation of quality throughout the chain, is central to value chain development. In Uganda, we find that there is a clear demand from dairy processors for better quality raw milk and substantial scope for quality improvement at the dairy farmer level, yet a market for quality does not develop, holding back further value chain transformation. In this study, we test two potential reasons why a market for quality does not develop through a field experiment with randomized interventions at different levels of the value chain. At the dairy farmer level, we conjecture that farmers are paying attention to the wrong quality attributes and design a video-based information campaign to point out what the quality parameters are that matter for processors. We also provide them with a small incentive to put what they learned into practice. Midstream, at milk collection centers where milk is bulked and chilled, we install technology that enables for quick and cheap testing of the milk that is brought in. We look at impact of both interventions at both farmer and milk collection center level and consider outcomes such as milk quality, prices received and quantities transacted. "
