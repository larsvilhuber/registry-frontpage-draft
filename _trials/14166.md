abstract: "Existing work has documented that interventions lead by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) tend to be more effective
than those lead by other actors, such as government agencies (Vivalt, 2020). Various observed and unobserved implementer-specific factors, such as implementer location, organizational capacity and beneficiaries’ prior experiences with the implementer, can influence the success of the implementer’s intervention. I define an “implementer” as the organization, institution or group involved in planning and executing an intervention. Many public health interventions in developing countries involve sharing information about health risks to encourage people to adopt protective or collective action behaviors. Whether communities adopt these protective behaviors could be affected by whether participants trust the implementer, which in turn may be influenced by prior experiences with the implementer. In this paper, my primary aim is to examine how making the identity of the implementer salient affects the extent to which people update their beliefs towards the provided information. In addition, I explore how belief formation in response to pre-existing perceptions and the information provision can affect  willingness to participate in a future intervention. I study these questions in the context of providing information on water pollution to mining communities in Ghana."
