abstract: "Households residing in the coastal areas of Bangladesh are extremely vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The higher incidence of floods and storms as well as the rise of the sea level induce frequent saltwater intrusion into freshwater resources. Consequently, the productivity of traditional agricultural activities decreases significantly while access to clean drinking water deteriorates. We use a clustered phase-in randomized control trial to study the impact of a project that aims to sustainably increase household resilience to natural disasters and to their consequences in terms of soil and water salinity. This project, implemented in the districts of Khulna and Satkhira, focusses on climate change adaptation and aims to provide households with access to sources of clean drinking water located closer to their house, thereby allowing women to re-allocate time from fetching water (for which they are responsible in the vast majority of surveyed households) towards: i) training on climate-adaptive livelihoods, and ii) income-generating activities promoted by the project. Women who participate in the project are organized into Women Livelihood Groups, through which they receive training on climate-adaptive livelihoods, as well as input support to implement said livelihoods. 
The project targets 101 wards in 39 Union Parishads (UPs) located across five Upazilas in the districts of Khulna and Satkhira. The RCT design includes two phases, with project implementation starting in February 2022 in the "early" group, and in October 2022 in the "late" group. We stratified randomization by Upazila and randomly allocated 25 UPs to the "early" group, and 15 UPs to the "late" group. Baseline data were collected on 3,120 beneficiaries in October 2021, and follow-up endline data will be collected in October 2022.
The main key indicators for the impact study are: resilience to natural shocks, captured in different dimensions, e.g., financial improvements (income, savings), self-reported preparedness; food security and diversity; income diversification and stability. Finally, we will analyze whether impacts arise through the intended key mechanism, namely that the drinking water solutions provided by the project allow women to re-allocate time towards income generation through adaptive livelihoods.
