abstract: "A factor underlying the poor productivity performance in the UK in recent years has been an underinvestment in new technologies. Such issues have applied in particular amongst SMEs, and in the “low wage sectors”, which include retail and hospitality - both large employers. As yet, little is known about the causal effects of policies that seek to stimulate the adoption of new technologies, and their impacts on business performance. This randomised control trial will seek to understand what type of intervention (light-touch versus more targeted) works for encouraging SME adoption of cutting-edge but tried and tested artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, and stimulating innovation and productivity improvements more broadly in London's retail and hospitality sectors."
