abstract: "This paper examines the extent to which Chilean banks discriminate against female borrowers in the consumer credit market. By using a self-selected sample of incentivized loan applicants, we match 404 male and female profiles on demographics and credit history information (exactly the same variables used by the banks to evaluate loan applications) to build a balanced sample of applicants across gender. We then  ask each applicant to send 4 loan requests through email (with random amounts and loan terms) to 4 different and randomly assigned bank executives who are in charge of selling loans to clients, for a total sample of 1,616 loan applications distributed across more than 600 bank executives. We analyze response, approval, and rejection rates across gender (external margin), as well as amount, interest rate, and term of approved loans (internal margin). We take advantage of a series of gender-preference elicitation pretests conducted to bank executives to infer whether potential differences across applicant's gender are originated on taste-based discrimination (as opposed to statistical) . Finally, we further conduct a salience experiment where emails about the importance and the prevalence of gender discrimination are sent from the governmental authority to the bank executives, so that we can test the effectiveness of information treatments on reducing gender discrimination in the consumer credit market.
