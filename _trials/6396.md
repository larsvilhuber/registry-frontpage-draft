abstract: "This study measures the effects of different forms of instructor communication in an online/hybrid class setting at a large, public university. Study participants randomly receive different forms of communications from their instructors. We hypothesize that various forms of communication in this setting has the potential to affect course grades, the frequency of help-seeking, and overall perceptions of instructor quality."
