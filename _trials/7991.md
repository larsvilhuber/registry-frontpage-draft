abstract: "Researchers typically categorize discrimination as either taste-based or belief-based discrimination based on either accurate or inaccurate beliefs. I argue, that when an agent does not hold randomly inaccurate beliefs, but instead holds inaccurate beliefs due to motivated reasoning, resulting discrimination looks like inaccurate statistical discrimination when it really is a form of motivated discrimination. While any kind of discrimination can have fatal consequences for the discriminated, a precise identification of the source of discrimination has important implications for effective policy interventions. In order to have a closer look at discrimination based on inaccurate beliefs I suggest a careful analysis of the formation of these inaccuracies. In particular analyze the effect of biased information processing on discriminatory behavior and show that people selectively attend to and interpret information in line with their motives - if they have the necessary 'wiggle room' to do so."
