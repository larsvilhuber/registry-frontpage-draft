abstract: "We use a randomized control trial on a sample of German-bank clients to study how central-bank trust affects the effectiveness of monetary-policy communication. Participating bank customers first answer questions on their beliefs about inflation; their trust in individuals and institutions, including the ECB; and their perception of benefiting from recent monetary policy. In a first treatment stage, we randomly divide the sample into subjects that receive information that sheds positive light on the ECB, while the other random half receives negative ECB information. The objective is to induce exogenous variation in trust toward the ECB. Following the first treatment stage, we re-elicit ECB trust and ask about the ECBâ€™s inflation target. In a second treatment stage, we randomly assign two thirds of subjects to a short ECB statement about its commitment to achieve its inflation target over the medium term. In the post-treatment stage, we test how treatment-induced changes in ECB trust affect how subjects incorporate the ECB statement to form consumption plans and macroeconomic expectations. Moreover, bank data allow us to estimate treatment effects on actual consumption and financial choices."
