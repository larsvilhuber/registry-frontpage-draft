abstract: "Despite reports of the benefit of carbon tax in generating revenues and contributing to the reduction of GHG emissions, lack of public support remains the major obstacle to its implementation in most countries. This could be attributed to concerns of its regressive effect and lack of adequate information by citizens. Using experimental procedure, this study aims to test if information provision and distributive preferences of revenues by households will lead to the acceptance of carbon tax. The study will use selected Nigerian households split into two equal groups comprising treatment and control groups. The treatment group will be provided with information on the mechanics of carbon taxation and revenue-use options to allocate tax revenues. Baseline and end-line data will be collected with a structured questionnaire. Analysis will be done with the use of appropriate techniques."
