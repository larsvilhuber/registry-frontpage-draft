abstract: "This study examines the role of religion in financial decision-making by utilising a field experiment with borrowers of the largest Islamic microfinance provider. There are three treatment arms: those who were selected to attend a loan disbursement in Pakistan's most famous mosque; those who received their principal in their local mosque; and those who received their principal in a branch. Changing the way that loans are disbursed provides exogenous variation in the religious conceptualisation of loans. Exploiting these differences, first the role of religion in repayments is considered. Next, the role of religion in charitable contributions is investigated. Finally, using survey data multiple behavioural hypotheses pertaining to individual and intra-household decision-making are tested. For instance, by receiving one's loan in a place of worship, it could create behavioural impediments for family members wishing to appropriate a borrower's loan. \\
