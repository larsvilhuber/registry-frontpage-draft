abstract: "The Dutch broader search program concerns workers who have been collecting unemployment insurance (UI) for six month. A random subsample of these UI recipients are invited for a mandatory caseworker meeting that focuses on job search strategies. If the caseworker believes that the UI recipients is searching too narrow, the UI recipients can receive a broader search task. The task should be completed before the next caseworker meeting and involves that the UI recipients should apply to a broader set of vacancies. "
