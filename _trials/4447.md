abstract: "This study examines whether teacher professional development in the form of a webinar series strengthens the effect of financial education on student performance. Specifically, it is investigated whether the professional development trajectory has an additional impact on the financial literacy of both teachers and students. To identify a causal effect, a randomized controlled trial is conducted. Schools are assigned to one of four conditions, of which one is a control condition and three are experimental conditions. To have sufficient power, we aim at more than 1000 students and 20 participating secondary schools in the Flemish region of Belgium. Eventually, the financial literacy test scores are compared between schools whose teachers follow the webinar series with schools whose teachers do not follow the webinar series.  "
