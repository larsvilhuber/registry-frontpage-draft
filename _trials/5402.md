abstract: "A popular argument in favour of diversity in committees is that different groups might have access to different information. Hence, by omitting some groups this information might be lost to the committee.

We study committee decision making when there is possible correlation between the information held by members of the same group. If people fail to properly account for this correlation, then decision making in homogeneous (non-diverse) committees might be substantially worse. We provide theoretical predictions for four scenarios differing by whether information of members of the same group is correlated or not and whether members of different groups have identical preferences over outcomes or not and then test these using a laboratory experiment.
