abstract: "I study how communication influences cooperation rates in an indefinitely repeated Prisoners' Dilemma under public monitoring of different noise levels with laboratory experiment. The experiment controls the noise and whether or not subjectscould pre-play communicate with their partner. The experiment aims to answer the following research questions:
Does communication help to sustain cooperation even under high noise when cooperation is theoretically not possible? Does communication influence cooperation rates by reducing the strategy uncertainty associated with belief?
To answer theses questions, I implement 6 treatments varying communication opportunity and the noise levels."
