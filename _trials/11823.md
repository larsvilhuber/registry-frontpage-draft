abstract: "Background and study aims
This study will assess the impact of Sunaula Hazar Din (SHD), a program implemented by the Government of Nepal. SHD uses the Rapid Results Approach (RRA) to improve nutritional indicators of pregnant women and children 0 to 24 months old, as well as family planning of women aged 15-25 years old. The evaluation will measure its effect on nutritional attitudes and outcomes. RRA is a results-focused learning process aimed at jump-starting major change efforts and enhancing implementation capacity. The approach creates motivation and confidence by defining goals and monitoring results in short periods (usually 100 days) and mobilizing communities to act and coordinate.

What does the study involve?
SHD will be implemented in randomly selected Village Development Committees. Community members can voluntarily participate in the activities organized by SHD in their Village Development Committee. Interviews and anthropometric measurements (such as height and weight) of children will be carried out at the start of the study and 24 months later to find out the impact of SHD on family planning and nutritional indicators.

Where is the study run from?
The study is run from Village Development Committees across 15 districts of Nepal."
