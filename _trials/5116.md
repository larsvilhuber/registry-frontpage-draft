abstract: "Is altruistic behavior in street donations affected by peers? We study how people's pro-social behavior is affected by watching others' donation behaviors. We implement a field experiment in the traffic lights on the streets of Lima (Peru), where it is common to see artists perform during the red light and then collect money from drivers before the light turns green. 

We exogenously vary three elements: (1) whether a driver sees another driver making a donation; (2) the gender of the performer; (3) the income-background appearance of the performer. The unit of analysis in our experiment is the vehicle, and we are interested in studying the behavior of passing-by drivers and passengers in terms of how often they donate to a street performer and how much.

We accompany this study with two follow-up surveys of drivers to disentangle the possible mechanisms of peer effects. "
