abstract: "We propose to evaluate the effectiveness of branchless banking agents in addressing two challenges. First, the growth of Government-to-Person (G2P) payment schemes in developing countries has created a need for strategies to make payments cheaply in rural areas where there is limited financial infrastructure. Second, financial inclusion is limited among the rural poor; while G2P programs are increasing the number of poor banked, few users actively use their accounts.

In Peru, the national conditional cash transfer program, JUNTOS, faces this double challenge. Payment (through bank branch or cash transporter) represents a costly logistical operation for the program, and the majority of users have to travel out of their district to receive payment. On the other hand, only a small fraction of users actively use their savings accounts, due to the difficult of accessing the branch and lack of information. To address these problems, Peru’s National Bank is rolling out a branchless banking agent network in village stores and local municipalities that offers withdrawal, remittance and purchase services. In a complementary intervention, we will offer workshops to improve the level of trust and empowerment of JUNTOS users in the banking system. 

We hypothesize that the introduction of the agents will lower the transaction costs of the cash transfer payments for both the program and for users, and that this will increase both JUNTOS users’ use of their accounts and total savings; we expect this effect to be larger when agents are combined with training. We will test these hypotheses using a randomized trial with two levels of randomization. Randomization among 59 districts will determine 30 districts that receive the agent intervention and 29 districts which act as controls for the duration of the intervention. Within the 30 treatment districts, there will be a subset of 140 villages selected to either receive the trust intervention workshop or not, with 70 in each group. "
