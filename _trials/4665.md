abstract: "A growing literature in economics highlights the importance of cities and neighborhoods for employment outcomes, social mobility, and individual well-being (Bayer et al., 2008; Chetty et al., 2014; Chetty et al., 2016). The importance of specific locations suggests that spatial segregation according to socioeconomic status is likely to be important for various aspects of inequality and welfare in a society. However, little is known about the drivers of spatial segregation, its evolution over time, and the implications for employment outcomes, individual welfare or mobility. Rising rents and house prices in large and growing cities and metropolitan areas are among the most pressing policy issues in many countries around the world. Ample anecdotal evidence from the media suggests that increasing rent levels lead to the displacement of current residents, changing neighborhood composition, and thereby rising segregation within and across cities. In this research project, we study the interplay of booms in local housing prices and socio-economic segregation across space and aim at quantifying the associated welfare consequences."
