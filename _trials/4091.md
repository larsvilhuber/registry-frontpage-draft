abstract: "School dropout is a growing concern in both developed and developing countries because of its negative social and economic consequences. This study examines whether a policy intervention that provides principals and teachers with a training and a brief guiding manual, flags at-risk students, and offers reminders and social recognition to school principals is effective to reduce school dropout in the transition from primary to secondary education and improve other educational outcomes in Guatemala. To that end, 4000 public primary schools in that country are randomly assigned to: (a) a control group (with no intervention), (b) a treatment group receiving a training and a brief guiding manual; (c) a treatment group receiving the same as group (b) plus a list of at-risk students; (d) a treatment group receiving the same as group (c) plus reminders and social recognition to school principals that were successful in reducing dropout."
