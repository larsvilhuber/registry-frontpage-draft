abstract: "Poor people often do not make investments, even when returns are high. One possible explanation is that they have low aspirations and form ideas of their future opportunities which ignore some options for investment. We outcome our plan to test this hypothesis through a field experiment to identify the effects of a documentary screening intervention. 

This study is a two-level cluster-randomized controlled trial. We randomly selected villages in a remote district in rural Ethiopia. We assign them to pure control or to receive one of two village-level treatments. Then within villages, we selected a random sample of 18 households and assigned them to three groups. A treatment group were randomly invited to watch documentaries. A placebo group in each village watched an Ethiopian entertainment programme and a control group were simply surveyed.

In addition, the number of people treated was varied by village to assess the importance of peer effects in formation of aspirations. We conduct follow-ups in 64 villages after 6 months and in all 84 villages after five years. 

In this pre-analysis plan, we describe analysis on data collected via face-to-face household surveys in 2010 (baseline), immediately after screenings in 2010 (midline 1), after six months in 2011 (midline 2), and after five years in 2015 (endline) and through surveys with the kebele (village) leader at baseline and endline. We also use administrative data at village level collected before our baseline."
