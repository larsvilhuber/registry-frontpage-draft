abstract: "Why are farmers so slow to adopt seemingly profitable new technologies? A vast literature has examined this question, focusing mainly on demand-side factors affecting farmers. An under-appreciated aspect of this problem is that new technologies are not typically tailored to the needs of many of the world’s small-scale farmers. Although public research centers are the main supplier of agricultural technology in most low-income countries, they often lack resources and mechanisms to match new technologies with farmers’ demand for innovation. This constraint can limit the ability of agricultural R&D to prioritize and target new technology. Yet, we know little about the impact on technological change when the choices of resource-constrained agricultural researchers do not reflect the preferences of the farmers who must ultimately take up the new technologies. We propose a field experiment to estimate the effect of imperfect targeting on farmers’ take-up of improved beans varieties in Costa Rica. Commonly, plant breeding programs release a single new variety per cycle to supply a large and heterogeneous group of farmers. The challenge is that we only observe the varieties that breeders release, not the counterfactual varieties they may have chosen to develop had they been able to better target farmers’ preferences for new varieties. We recreate these counterfactual scenarios in an experiment that relaxes information constraints on breeders to estimate their effect on the adoption decisions of 840 small and medium-scale farmers."
