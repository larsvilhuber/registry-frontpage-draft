abstract: "This paper examines whether offering afterschool care for 6- to 13-year-old children has an impact on labor market outcomes among women in Chile with a randomized experiment. Effects on labor force participation and employment are found: program participation increases employment by 5% and participation by 7%. The program has stronger effects among women with young children who were ineligible for the program. At the same time, the program triggers the use of daycare for young (ineligible) children. The results are consistent with the indivisibility of childcare: all children must be eligible in order to break the childcare constraint."
