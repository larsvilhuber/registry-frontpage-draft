abstract: "We implement a field experiment to examine optimal incentives for charitable giving. The price of giving is varied by offering a fixed match if the donation meets a threshold amount (e.g. "give at least $25 and the charity receives a $25 match''). Different threshold matches are tested in the field with participating charities. "
