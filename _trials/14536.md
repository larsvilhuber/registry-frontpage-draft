abstract: "We work with a government-backed online lending platform in China to examine borrowers’ loan choices. The platform allows borrowers to directly borrow money from banks. Banks will list their loan products on the platform. Any individual or a small business with a valid Chinese ID can register with the platform and apply for loans. From the platform’s historical data and the pilot study, we find that borrowers often make sub-optimal decisions by choosing loans with worse characteristics (e.g., high interest rate, slow processing time, low approval rate). In this study, we examine whether a simple visual nudge by labeling the loan product can change borrowers’ loan choices, potentially helping them make better decisions."
