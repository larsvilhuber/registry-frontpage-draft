abstract: "With a population of around 3 million, Armenia has a high road fatality rate of 9.4 deaths per 100,000 people. In 2019, road crash fatalities were more than double the European Union (EU) average, and the socioeconomic costs of road crashes are estimated at 5.7 percent of Armeniaâ€™s GDP.  
Within a wider context of road safety improvement projects in Armenia, the purpose of the current trial is to test whether messages using different behavioral framings cause any significant change in the driving behavior of the subjects concerned.

The specific research questions are:
-	Is the communication with the drivers using the existing channels effective to deter risky driving behavior (in particular, speeding)? 
-	Do the drivers respond differently to messages which are designed to target different biases and themes?
-	Does the information on relative position of the driver in terms of driving license points lost create incentives to change risky driving behavior?

The trail is aiming to run a behavioral randomized controlled trial that would address the research questions stated just above. It will utilize the existing infrastructure used by road police to communicate with the drivers about their performance. 
The overall aim of the trial is to reduce the number of traffic rules violations with a specific emphasize on speed regime violations.

In this trial we will be implementing 2 different RCTs which utilize different communication means and intend to reach out to the drivers with the purpose of changing their risky driving behavior.

The first experiment will utilize the existing modes of communication used by road police to communicate with the drivers about their performance (mainly official letters). The second experiment will use additional SMS to be sent to the drivers.
