abstract: "We examine the role of confidence about academic ranking and mechanism knowledge on application behavior for postsecondary education. Therefore, we conduct a survey experiment with participants of the French college assignment system. Before applicants decide on their final application and before universities start to make their offers, we ask for applicantsâ€™ preferred order of universities. To study confidence, we ask for their belief about their relative GPA rank, and the treatment group receives information on their true GPA rank. To study mechanism knowledge, we provide another treatment group with information on the rules of the mechanism. We investigate the effects of information provision on application behavior, as well as predicted and actual placement."
