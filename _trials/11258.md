abstract: "This project is in collaboration with TeachFX and a research team that specializes in the use of natural language processing in education. This project involves giving feedback to teachers and tutors on their use of focusing questions in the classroom. To do so, it leverages both manual annotation and computational natural language processing techniques. The primary purpose of this study is to measure the effect of this feedback."
