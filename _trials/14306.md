abstract: "This study aims to evaluate the impact of carbon footprint labels on student food choices at an university's canteen through a longitudinal observational design. The intervention involves the phased introduction of carbon footprint labels in one restaurant within the canteen. The labeling will be implemented in stages, progressing from basic carbon emission numbers to more detailed environmental connections, to assess the influence of varying levels of labeling on purchasing behavior.

The primary outcome will be the percentage change in the selection of low-carbon footprint meals versus high-carbon footprint meals. Secondary outcomes include the total carbon footprint of meals purchased and the frequency of purchases of labeled versus non-labeled meals. By tracking actual meal purchases through the university's backend consumption records, the study seeks to provide a robust analysis of how carbon footprint labeling affects student choices over time.

The intervention will commence on September 2, 2024, and conclude on June 1, 2025. Data collection will involve baseline measurements prior to labeling, followed by the gradual introduction of labels, and concluding with post-intervention analysis. The study will use a regression framework and time-series analysis to examine changes in purchasing behavior, aiming to detect a 5% shift in the proportion of low-carbon meal selections. "
