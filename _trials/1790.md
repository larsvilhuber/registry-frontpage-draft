abstract: "We carried out a randomized evaluation of a mobile savings account targeted at poor rural and peri-urban households in Zanzibar. The mobile savings account was developed by Zantel, Zanzibar's leading mobile phone operator. Account holders can make withdrawals and deposits to their mobile savings account by using their cell phone and visiting a participating local retailer, such as a grocery store. We are interested in how the provision of savings accounts affects the welfare of individuals that are enrolled in the evaluation of the savings product, as well as the effect on the individual's social network. To measure social network effects, we asked savings account recipients for the names of at least two other households that are in their social network: an "altruistic" tie (such as a friend or neighbor) and an "obligatory" tie (such as a family member). We are studying how the provision of savings accounts to the treated individuals affects the welfare of the altruistic tie and obligatory tie households, as well as the focal individuals themselves."
