abstract: "We study the impact of professional development of teachers in secondary education in the Flemish region of Belgium. We investigate whether an online training module affects financial knowledge and behavior of both teachers and students. To identify a causal effect, we make use of a randomized controlled trial in which 48 schools and approximately 2000 students participate. Schools are randomly assigned to one of the treatment conditions. We compare financial literacy test scores in schools in which teachers follow a training module to test scores in schools in which teachers do not follow this module."
