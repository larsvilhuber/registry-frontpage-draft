abstract: "Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, religion, or sexual orientation is highly persistent in multiple settings. Much research is needed to understand the mechanism behind differential treatment (Bertrand & Duflo, 2017). One of the research areas that require attention is how individuals are affected at the intersection of these traits. In this project, we are interested in the intersection of LGBTQ support and sexual orientation with ethnicity. 

We perform a large-scale field experiment in Germany based on a correspondence study. Fictitious applicants contact coaches via email asking to join a trial training with a native- or a foreign-sounding name. The emails are identical, and the response rate to the different groups can provide evidence of discrimination. The experimental design is very similar to previous field experiments we performed in several European countries (Gomez-Gonzalez et al., 2021) and has a twofold aim.

First, we aim to examine if showing support for the LGBTQ movement negatively influences an individual's chance to obtain a response when contacting a sport club. Additionally, we examine if foreign background plays a role in this relationship. Our treatment showing support for the LGBTQ movement is a subtle signal in the signature of the email during pride month.

Second, we aim to examine if signaling homosexuality negatively influences an individual's chance to obtain a response when contacting a sport club. Additionally, we examine if foreign background plays a role in this relationship. Our treatment signals homosexuality by mentioning that the applicant has just moved to the area with a female/male partner.

In total, we contact 6023 amateur sports clubs."
