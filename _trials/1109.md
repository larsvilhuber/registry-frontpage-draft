abstract: "This project tests a novel method of assessing microenterprise potential by harnessing community information. We ask: can community information—knowledge that neighbors, customers, community leaders, family members, and friends hold about one another—help identify which would-be microentrepreneurs have the most growth potential? Previous studies have demonstrated that community members have information about one another’s assets. Here, we study whether community members can also predict who high-potential business owners are."
