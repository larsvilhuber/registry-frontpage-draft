abstract: "Quantifying the willingness to pay (WTP) for new technologies is essential for accurately estimating demand. The Becker-DeGroot-Marshack (BDM) method is a well-established revealed-preference approach for assessing individuals' WTP for public goods and services. BDM is extensively used in experimental economics, and recent applications have extended to estimating demand in developing countries. However, existing studies often overlook variations in budget constraints over time, potentially leading to biased estimations. This study addresses this gap by employing the BDM mechanism to assess the willingness to pay for a new vaccine for East Coast Fever (ECF) among cattle farmers in Kenya. ECF is a significant threat to livestock populations in Africa, particularly cattle. Using random variation in timing, we also seek to assess the impact of exogenous liquidity constraints on WTP elicitation. If WTP represents a stable valuation, independent of constraints, then recent shocks and other constraints should not affect measured WTP. If they do, that would suggest that what we capture as willingness-to-pay may truly represent some combination of willingness and ability to pay. Our study will also contribute to a broader literature on optimal pricing strategies for vaccine adoption and barriers to vaccination use."
