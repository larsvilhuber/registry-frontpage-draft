abstract: "Court-Annexed Mediation brings the promise of speeding up resolution of disputes, reducing the cost of access to justice, and providing the space for parties to creatively find solutions to their grievances. However, there is limited research on the potential of technological innovations to improve the efficiency and productivity of mediators and on the parties' resolution of their disputes. In this study, we evaluate the impact of an innovative data management and analytics platform, Cadaster, on the efficiency and quality of mediation in Kenya. The study relies on the random implementation of Cadaster across half of the court stations in Kenya during a pilot period of 3 months. In addition to measuring the overall productivity and quality of mediation, we will evaluate the impact of Cadaster on the satisfaction of the parties, their capacity to resolve their disputes and possibly their socioeconomic status.
