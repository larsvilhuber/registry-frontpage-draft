abstract: "The Wilson Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunities (LEO) has partnered with Girls Inc. of Greater Indianapolis, located in Indianapolis, Indiana, to evaluate their EmpowerHub program. EmpowerHub is a high-impact, comprehensive program with a primary focus on supporting participants to explore healthy lifestyles, academic achievement, life skills development, and STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math) exposure. Middle school girls are identified for the program if they are entering sixth grade at a participating middle school within Indianapolis Public Schools (IPS). Including within IPS, chronic absenteeism remains at an all time high and school enrollment has not recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Overall school engagement can be a challenge, particularly for students from diverse and low-socioeconomic families like many of the families in IPS. A key component of this program is the provision of a safe space during the school day for young girls to develop the skills and community to address the challenges they face.
To evaluate this program, we will use a randomized control trial (RCT) to examine whether the program improves grades,  homework completion, school attendance, and disciplinary outcomes. Eligible girls are randomly assigned to one of two groups: a control group, not offered a spot in EmpowerHub (630 individuals), or the treatment group, offered a spot in EmpowerHub (420 individuals). The study will utilize administrative records from Indianapolis Public Schools and Girls Inc. program data. Results from this RCT will be disseminated to policymakers and providers across the country to inform the replication and expansion of programs designed to support under-resourced children. We plan to enroll approximately 1,050 people in the study over three years (academic years 2024-25 to 2026-27)."
