abstract: "The primary purpose of trial is to compare and analyze Cost-benefit, utility, effectiveness and Global rate of perception for change after Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy (ESWT) versus ultrasound combined with exercise therapy options on both groups, in patients with diabetic Frozen Shoulder. The secondary outcomes of the trial are to compare insurance coverage difference on diabetic versus non diabetic frozen shoulder. Thirty two participants are currently screened and randomly selected  21 with acceptable eligibility criteria were included in this study during this point.The study was/will be conducted and continued at outpatient physiotherapy clinics of Umm-Al-Quwain and Ajman, U.A.E.  The participants are allocated into two groups; experimental group i.e., Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy with exercises and control group i.e., ultrasound therapy with exercises. The primary economic outcomes are a) ESWT treatment cost; to provide solid evidence that ESWT treatment will provide lower expenditure  b) cost incurred for both treatments group i.e, ESWT versus Ultrasound group c) point score improvement on a generic or pain condition-speciÔ¨Åc health status measure using pain-free day and d) to support procurement decision on additional units in rehabilitation/physiotherapy department. The primary clinical outcomes are pain, range of motion on shoulder joint, disability and impairment scores. The data of the study will be analysed using SPSS-12 version at the end of trail date. Observational and percentage analysis of clinical outcomes study currently favours ESWT treatment group by improvements recorded in pain, range of motion and satisfaction scores after treatment compared to control group. The current cost benefit analysis favours ESWT intervention. ESWT intervention provided 3 times lesser medical rehabiliation cost compared to control group. Current percenatege analysis of this study supports the decision to procurement of ESWT in outpatient physiotherapy departments.
