abstract: "The evaluation of The Hunger Project’s epicenter scale-up strategy looks at the multifaceted links between health, education, food security, and micro-finance through the construction of community centers, known as “epicenters” within Ghana’s eastern region. The evaluation began in 2007 when we worked with The Hunger Project and Ghana’s district assemblies to randomly select clusters of villages from each district to participate in the intervention. Two villages per cluster were randomly selected as part of the survey sample and a public lottery was held to invite 20 households from each village to participate in the survey. Approximately 3800 households were surveyed across 194 villages for the baseline. A qualitative evaluation was conducted in 2009 and the endline survey was concluded in 2013. Given the duration of the evaluation a detailed tracking exercise was also conducted on a sample of attrition households following the endline.  "
