abstract: "Voter turnout has been consistently decreasing in Chile over time, specially among less affluent young people. Participation rates went even lower after the implementation of voluntary voting in 2012 (Corval√°n et al 2013). In this context, exploring strategies to increase turnout have become of paramount importance to strengthen our democracy. This project implements a behavioral experiment based on get-out-to-vote strategies (Gerber & Green, 2000) in Chile. These strategies have been developed and applied successfully in other countries with voluntary voting, like the U.S. The evidence suggests that voter turnout can increase interventions such as canvassing, mails or text-messages (see Gerber & Green, 2000, 2008, 2015), which is what this project wants to test for the Chilean case. We also test whether skills, distance, socioeconomic status explain voter turnout to the greatest extent.
