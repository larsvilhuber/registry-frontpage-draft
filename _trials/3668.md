abstract: "We present an extension of the experiments reported in our paper “Market Interaction and Efficient Cooperation” (Brandts and Riedl, 2018). The extension consists in conducting an additional treatment of the “Only Social Dilemma Game” (OSDG), in which, before the OSDG itself, participants can earn money in an individual real-effort task. Our objective is to compare the data from the new treatment with those from one previous treatment, called Market-Partners (MP), reported in our paper. In th MP treatment participants played a social-dilemma game after having interacted and earned money in a double-auction market. In our new treatment participants will play the social dilemma after having earned money in a real-effort task. "
