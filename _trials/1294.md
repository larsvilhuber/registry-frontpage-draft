abstract: "The proposed research is a survey of potential workers in India who are seeking employment in the UAE. The UAE
Ministry of Labor is working with a recruitment firm in India to enhance the general skills of workers while they are still
in India as well as randomizing a small share of eligible workers out of job eligibility _at that recruitment center_. The training program is designed to be directly linked to skills in construction jobs in the UAE. The research
involves a survey that will be given to this pool of workers. The survey is based on questions from the NSS survey
conducted by the Indian Government (first conducted in 1950), and on the Yale EGC-CMF Tamil Nadu Panel Survey.
The survey collects basic (voluntary) demographic data, as well as information on current and future expected employment and earnings.

The followup, which is still being designed and will likely be 18 months since recruitment, will ask about subjective well being, assets and debt, employment histories, family/ marriage outcomes. We plan on linking the subjects that actually do migrate to administrative data on earnings and time of migration. We expect many of the subjects to migrate even if they are randomized out, as there are a large number of other recruitment firms on the ground.
