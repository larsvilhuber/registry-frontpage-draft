abstract: "Garment workers in Dhaka have hyper-local commutes, mostly on foot. Is this a positive sign that Dhakaâ€™s high urban density delivers sufficient attractive job opportunities? Or does this happen due to spatial frictions, either because long travel times and expensive transport make commuting further away difficult, or because information flows about job openings and workplace conditions decay quickly with distance? We run an experiment providing workers and job seekers information on hiring at high-wage factories, and study measures of job application and interest."
