abstract: "Workers and firms in low and middle-income countries operate in a credit-constrained environment characterized by asymmetric information. Firms are unaware of the productivity and trustworthiness of the worker, and workers are unsure whether the firms will pay them on time or at all. Neither the worker nor the firm can commit to a contract. Theory suggests that a consequence of these market failures and the firm's own credit constraints is that firms should offer back-loaded contracts. We will test this theoretical prediction in an experiment where we offer to hire workers for firms with different payment structures. Workers dislike back-loaded contracts because they can't trust the firm to abide by them (due to limited commitment on the firm side) and due to consumption credit constraints. We will test this hypothesis in a take-up experiment where we offer real contracts of different lengths and payment structures to a random sample of workers. Our experiment will disentangle the effect of credit constraints and information asymmetry on the take-up of jobs by workers. Workers and firms who agree to take up the contracts will be matched with each other. The effects of contract structure on worker productivity, worker-firm disagreements will be measured."
