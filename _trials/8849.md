abstract: "An important question in understanding the dynamics of discriminatory behavior is why statistical discrimination based on inaccurate beliefs occurs and -- perhaps more importantly -- why it persists when correcting information is available. For example, Americans hold inaccurate beliefs about household income by race, even though accurate information is readily available through the Census Bureau. Aigner & Cain (1977) assume such ``mistaken behavior" will not persist in competitive markets. However, if inaccurate priors about group productivity are driven by bias rather than a lack of information, they may be resistant to updating in the face of accurate information that contradicts a stereotype about that group. A recent hiring experiment showed that not all participants fully updated their inaccurate beliefs about the productivity of stigmatized groups after receiving correcting information, leading to persistent discrimination.  This proposed experiment investigates the source of this non-Bayesian updating. "
