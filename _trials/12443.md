abstract: "Most economic actors -- incorporated firms, self-employed and employees -- in low-income countries are not tax registered and among those registered, non-compliance (under-reporting and failure to declare) is common. Obtaining reliable information on the existence and scope of their economic activities poses complex challenges to tax administrations operating with very limited resources. As a consequence, many administrations have chosen to concentrate enforcement efforts to a small number of larger firms regrouped in Large Taxpayers and Medium-sized Taxpayers units. We hypothesize that due to their centrality in a country's production network, these taxpayers can be a valuable entry point for the administration to obtain information about the economic activities of less compliant and harder to reach actors. In this RCT, we work with the Senegalese tax administration to test whether information provided by large and medium-sized taxpayers on their buyer-seller relationships with other economic actors can be leveraged to expand enforcement among the latter."
