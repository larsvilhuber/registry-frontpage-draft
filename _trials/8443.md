abstract: "Overtreatment is widespread in health care, including in low- and middle-income settings. In primary care, providers often recommend unnecessary drugs, with potential dire consequences for patients, health systems and public health. Recent evidence suggests that providers recommend unnecessary treatment even in the absence of direct financial incentives and when they know what the appropriate treatment is. Providers have sometimes explained their decisions to overtreat as a response to an actual or perceived demand from patients, who, in a relationship characterized by asymmetry of information, may interpret treatment characteristics as a signal of quality. We design a simple vignette experiment to test (1) whether reduced overtreatment is perceived as a signal of worse quality of care and (2) the relevance of the treatment signal against another typical signal of quality care (thoroughness of the consultation)."
