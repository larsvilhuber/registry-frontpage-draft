abstract: "We will design and test the effect of monetary and non-monetary incentives on the achievement, persistence and graduation rates of community college students. In partnership with a large community college in Indiana, we will use a randomized controlled trial to test: (1) the effects of incentive-pay for instructors, and (2) The effect of combining instructor incentives with performance-based summer scholarships for students. These incentives will be based on student performance on standardized exams given throughout the semester. "
