abstract: "We plan to analyze the effects of provincial versus local (chief) taxation on citizen engagement. Our study is based on a field experiment implemented in Kananga, DRC where 367 neighborhoods were randomly assigned to have property taxes collected by provincial tax collectors
versus by local chiefs. We propose to examine whether taxation by different levels of government induces greater citizen engagement directed towards the level of government that collected taxes. Moreover, we probe whether decentralized taxation is accountability enhancing in light
of the fact that chiefs might also engage in more ethnic taxation, which could lead to more ethnic-based collective action and deepen ethnic divisions within communities. We measure citizen engagement using a novel behavioral exercise in which citizens have an opportunity to
act collectively to demand a community monitoring meeting in the context of a real-world anti-poverty program. Overall, this inquiry aims to shed light on the engagement and accountability implications of taxation at different levels of government in fragile states."
