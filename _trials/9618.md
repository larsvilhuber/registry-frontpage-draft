abstract: "We study the effects of a "big-push" program providing large asset transfers, coaching and other support to very poor women in rural Bangladesh. We focus in particular on the role of coaching within the programme, using an RCT implemented in 2016 to test whether changing the size and nature of the coaching element has lasting impacts on programme effectiveness.  

Big push interventions have received much scholarly attention over the last decade, with most of these studies finding large, positive and enduring impacts of the programme on outcomes ranging from health and education, to asset holdings and political involvement. However, since these interventions are really a composite bundle consisting of an asset transfer, consumption support, savings facilities, and regular training/coaching, less is known about what is driving impact and through what mechanisms. At the same time, a major draw-back of these programmes, with implications for scaling, is that they are expensive and logistically burdensome to implement.  This study seeks to understand the role that the form and intensity of the coaching element of BRAC's Targeting the Ultra-Poor (TUP) programme has in explaining some key outcomes, and the mechanisms through which coaching has an impact on these outcomes.
