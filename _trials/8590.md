abstract: "When an experimenter uses a game where different subjects assume different roles, she has to choose between protocols for a random match. In particular, she has to decide whether to fix the roles throughout the experiment or reassign them. Under the fixed-role protocol, a player continues to play the role assigned at the beginning of the experiment, regardless of whether players are rematched or not. Under the changing-role protocol, subjects experience different roles. We explore how this experience would effect players' behavior in a sequential  public goods game.
