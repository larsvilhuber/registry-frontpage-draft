abstract: "In 2016, the World Bank and the Ministry of Agriculture of Punjab, Pakistan worked together to provide to all field workers smart phones equipped with a monitoring system called Agri-Smart. This project, joint with the Ministry of Agriculture of the Government of Punjab, Pakistan, proposes to introduce and evaluate performance-based incentives using the Agri-Smart system, to reward greater outreach efforts by field staff. The goal is to improve agricultural productivity which is seen as critical for both poverty reduction and growth.

We will pilot different incentive schemes to answer the primary research question is “How can different bonus schemes for agriculture extension workers improve service outreach and quality to meet the needs of farmers?”  

Answering this question will significantly advance our knowledge in the context of a sector critical to economic development in Pakistan and contributes to the literature on performance pay in the public sector.
