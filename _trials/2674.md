abstract: "We set up a controlled laboratory experiment to test a bargaining model. There are obstinate types present in the population of bargainers, and bargainers may have access to outside options or not. In the model access to outside options removes the incentive non-obstinate bargainers have to mimik obstinate bargainers, with efficiency gains resulting. "
