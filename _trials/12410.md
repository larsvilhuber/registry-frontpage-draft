abstract: "The research intends to study immigrant discrimination in the Argentinian labor market, using a Randomized Control Trial (RCT). Based on the seminal paper of Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004), fictitious but plausible resumes will be sent to active job vacancies published on a digital platform. The treatment is being from a non-Argentine nationality. I am sending resumes to four different kinds of work and different industries. Due to the origin from the immigrants in Argentina, the treatment will be the nationality from neighboring countries (Paraguay, Bolivia, Chile and Uruguay). I distinguish two different treatments, considering the various cultural similarities between those countries and the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires (AMBA). Particularly there will be two treatments: being from Paraguay or Bolivia, and being from Chile or Uruguay. The control group will be the resumes with argentinian nationality."
