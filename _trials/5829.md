abstract: "The success of small-scale farmers in developing countries relies on the availability of adequate financial markets. Binding credit constraints can be an impediment to investment in a setting with high expected returns. We study the impacts of providing credit to small-scale farmers by randomly allocating loans to individual farmers in the context of a randomized experiment in Ghana. Traditional microcredit models have had limited success in agriculture, where low population densities and poor infrastructure makes credit delivery and monitoring costly. We incorporate an emerging alternative technology, digital credit, as an integral part of the loan process. We also combine digital credit with several improvements over traditional models of lending to the poor. Our aim is to contribute both to the understanding of the effects of this nascent technology and to the more established yet growing literature on the impacts of short-term credit in agriculture. "
