abstract: "The goal of this study is to estimate the impact of a training of teachers aimed at helping them adopt new pedagogical practices to develop high levels of self-confidence, self-efficacy, cooperation, and intrinsic motivation in young students. In France, such pedagogical training may be particularly useful as self-confidence and perceptions of one’s chance of success are among the lowest of OECD countries, while anxiety and fear of failure are among the highest (PISA 2012, 2015). According to TALIS 2013, only 58% of French teachers feel pedagogically well prepared for their profession, as compared to 89% on average in OECD countries. 
This research project aims to fill this gap. It targets 1st grade (cours préparatoire) teachers in two French Académie (Versailles and Paris), with the goal of providing them with the most recent results in economics, psychology, sociology and cognitive sciences, as well as with practical information on the pedagogical practices that are effective for developing academic motivation based on socio-behavioural skills. The ultimate objective of the project is to increase students’ learning and academic outcomes for all students, while at the same time reducing social inequality at school.
