abstract: "It is estimated that one in three women experiences intimate partner violence (IPV) in her lifetime, and that social norms about the roles of women and men are a contributing factor to IPV. The objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of a couples-based intervention on the prevention of intimate partner violence in Rwanda’s Eastern Province. The study will be conducted by the World Bank’s Africa Gender Innovation Lab in collaboration with the Government of Rwanda’s Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion (MIGEPROF). The intervention evaluated is a program informed by other gender-based violence prevention programs including SASA! in Uganda and Indashyikirwa in Rwanda, and will be implemented by MIGEPROF, CARE and local NGOs. The program seeks volunteer couples who are existing members of village savings and loan associations (VSLAs) to participate in 22 weekly discussion group sessions led by a trained local facilitator. The curriculum encourages men and women to reflect on gender roles and concepts of masculinity and femininity, to build communication skills to resolve conflict peacefully, and to understand ways to reduce and prevent intimate partner violence in their households and communities.  

The study is a cluster randomized control trial, with randomization at three levels: village, VSLA group, and couple. In the 128 treated villages, 2 VSLAs will be selected for treatment, and within each of these VSLAs, 5 self-selected married couples will be selected for treatment. Control individuals in control villages and VSLAs will not receive any intervention.   

Key outcomes examined include: (i) experience of past year physical, sexual and psychological violence reported by women; (ii) participant’s self-reported gender attitudes and behaviors, and conflict management skills; (iii) power sharing and communication within the couple; (iv) individual and household economic outcomes; and (v) diffusion and reinforcement effects of the intervention on individuals in the village social network.
