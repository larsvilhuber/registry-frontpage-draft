abstract: "Our study is designed to understand whether men strategically enforce restrictive norms in response to gendered intra-household competition for work. We aim to distinguish between several hypotheses for how reserving jobs for specific gender (compared to letting men and women compete for job opportunities) affect gender norms and attitudes. Our study offers mobile app-based gig work, addressing many issues that typically hinder women from working—e.g., concerns about privacy and mobility—but are also attractive to men due to high remuneration. We cross-randomize gender reservations for jobs (male, female, or open to both genders) and high and low-wage opportunities across community clusters.

We will evaluate how gender norms are expressed when men have to compete with women from their own households for the jobs, and whether there is an interaction between the gender reservation and wage treatments. We will also measure any changes in norms surrounding women’s work after the gig jobs are completed and -- in a separate experiment with workers recruited during the first experiment -- whether embedded gender messaging in work tasks affects gender attitudes and worker productivity. We examine whether these effects vary by gender.
