abstract: "Women-owned/led small- and medium-sized enterprises (WSMEs) are estimated to earn less than one percent of procurement spend by large corporations and governments worldwide. There is a lack of rigorous quantitative evidence on interventions designed to support WSMEsâ€™ participation in procurement. This study uses an RCT to estimate the impact of capacity-building solutions for WSMEs --- comprising online and in-person trainings, and related activities --- on their procurement-readiness."
