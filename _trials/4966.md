abstract: "Mobility-on-demand services such as Careem, Grab, Lyft and Uber increase transit options in developing country cities where many residents are underserved by public transit systems and private services are relatively costly. In this experiment we are collaborating with one of these service providers to assess the impacts of expanding access to its services through large subsidies.  In particular, this research project aims to explore three main questions: (1) What is the demand response in a developing country city to reductions in the price of mobility-on-demand services? (2) Do reductions in travel costs differentially affect women versus men due to concerns about safety and harassment? (3) What are the labor market benefits of decreasing the travel costs of job seekers?  Using a randomized experiment with three subsidy groups, three information groups, and detailed, high-frequency data collection, the project will be able to estimate parameters that are important to academics and policy makers around the world.
