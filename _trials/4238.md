abstract: "Nudges and changes to choice architecture can affect individual behaviors, especially for infrequent, unfamiliar decisions. However, whether the same interventions are equally effective in changing the behaviors of experts leading an organization is an open question. We use three randomized field experiments to test the efficacy of five nudges and changes in choice architecture that have been shown to affect individual-level decisions in public good provision and charitable giving contexts. The nudges are 1) raising the salience of the ask, 2) emphasizing the public benefits from contributions, 3) providing social comparisons, 4) publicly recognizing contributors (creating observability), and 5) setting a collective goal. In the three field experiments, local organizations make decisions about whether to contribute financially to a national coordinating organization. The local organizations are conservation districts in the United States, which are independent, nonprofit organizations managed by elected local agricultural operators. In comparison to the estimated treatment effects of similar interventions among individuals, our estimated effects on organizations are dramatically smaller and of the opposite sign. Our results, in combination with prior laboratory studies on group-individual differences, suggest that nudges and changes in choice architecture may not affect the behaviors of experts leading organizations to the same degree as they affect the behaviors of individuals making infrequent and unfamiliar decisions."
