abstract: "In this study, we explore the dual role of micro-entrepreneurs in central Ghana, who simultaneously act as firm owners and household decision-makers. We focus on "firm-households," a ubiquitous economic agent in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which internalizes both profit and utility maximization processes. We present a classical demand test with a randomized controlled trial: half of our study participants are assigned to receive cash transfers, and the other half are assigned to an equivalent and infra-marginal in-kind commercial electricity transfers. We observe their electricity consumption before, during, and after the intervention and analyze the impact of these different transfers differentiating between residential and commercial use. Our findings highlight how these transfers influence firm-households' allocation of electricity across home and business settings. We present evidence on whether firm-households internalize positive wealth shocks differently based on the transfer medium and whether they substitute consumption across locations. The study offers insights into the separation of utility and profit maximization problems by microentrepreneurs and informs policy on energy usage and transfer mechanisms in LMICs."
