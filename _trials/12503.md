abstract: "This is an ex-post registration of Experiment 1, conducted for the paper entitled "Everyday econometricians: Selection neglect and overoptimism when learning from others." 

The paper reports the results from two sets of experiments. Both sets of experiments study whether individuals neglect selection effects when learning from data generated by others' decisions. 

Experiment 2 was pre-registered in a separate registration file (https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/10536). "
