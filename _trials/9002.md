abstract: "Online job fairs may dramatically reduce search costs and improve labor market outcomes. Online job fairs are much cheaper and more accessible than in-person job fairs. The low cost and high accessibility of online job fairs may particularly cater to jobseekers and firms that are poor and/or in remote areas. We conduct a field experiment to estimate the effects of an online job fair on workers’ labor market outcomes. Partnering with a large online job portal in Bangladesh, we organize an online job fair for ICT jobs, where jobseekers learn job openings, attend employers’ live video presentations, and apply and interview for jobs. The RCT adopts an oversubscription design on jobseeker side: jobseekers are randomly selected as treatment jobseekers (i.e., those who are invited to the fair) and control jobseekers (those who are not). 

Note. We conducted a pilot online job fair in February 2021, which registry ID is AEARCTR-0007294.
