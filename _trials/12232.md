abstract: "Intergenerational inequality is a pressing issue in societies worldwide, with Germany ranking among the most unequal countries regarding the influence of family background on childrenâ€™s educational success. Interventions targeted at disadvantaged children, such as mentoring programs, have been demonstrated to be effective in compensating for the lack of family support and improving life outcomes of disadvantaged children. One of the most significant and pervasive problems that hampers efficacy of mentoring programs is the breakdown of mentoring relationships during the course of the program. High dropout rates pose a significant challenge to the effectiveness of mentoring programs, particularly for vulnerable adolescents at risk of dropping out. However, strategies to counteract program dropout have not yet been studied systematically. We address this research gap through a field experiment with a one-to-one online mentoring program for disadvantaged youths. We randomly provide financial incentives to mentees if they successfully complete the first months of their mentoring-relationship. "
