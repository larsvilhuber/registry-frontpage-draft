abstract: "This project aims to investigate how having the option to delay entry into competition can affect the gender gap in the willingness to compete. If there is a gendered effect (women being more/less likely to compete when having the option to delay entry into competition), we would like to examine the mechanisms behind it, including gender differences in hyperbolic discounting, risk preferences, confidence, and the desire to prepare for the future task."
