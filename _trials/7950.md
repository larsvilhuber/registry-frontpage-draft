abstract: "Almost all the existing literature on auctions – theoretical and experimental – focuses on the case when bidders make cash bids. In recent auction practice, however, bidders often can make share bids; that is, they bid a share of the future cash flow that is generated after winning the auction. In this experimental study, we investigate bidding behavior in the context of share auctions, both for first- and second-price sealed-bid auctions, and compare it to bidding behavior in cash auctions."
