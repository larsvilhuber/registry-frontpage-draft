abstract: "In 2014, nearly 40% of individuals issued a ticket for a violation in New York City did not show up to court, and were issued an arrest warrant as a result. Given this stiff penalty, it might seem that people would only miss court if they deliberately chose to do so. But a behavioral approach suggests other reasons why people might miss court: they might have simply forgotten or engaged in “ostrich behavior.” If these behavioral bottlenecks account for some failures to appear (FTA), then it may be possible to reduce FTA without resorting to the usual strict penalties. With our partners in New York City, we are testing whether various text message reminders can reduce FTA. We have designed several reminders, and we have been conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine whether these messages can help, and which are most helpful. Over the course of approximately 12 months, summons recipients will be randomized into one of eight treatment arms. We will use administrative court data and (pending approval) police data to assess the efficacy of the messaging program in general and which message content in particular is most effective in reducing FTA.
