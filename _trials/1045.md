abstract: "The objectives of this intervention are to expand access to quality Early Childhood Education (ECE) for 3-5 year olds (through construction of facilities, provision of materials, training of staff), as well as to build the demand for Early Childhood Care and Development ECCD services among families from disadvantaged backgrounds. Parent education is used to maximize the impact of ECCD services on child cognitive and psychosocial developmentâ€”with a focus on (primary) school readiness. The study aims to find out whether the provision of simple community preschools increases enrolment and retention rates in ECCD services. Particularly with an eye towards primary school readiness, effects on the cognitive and socio-emotional development of young children will be measured. Further, it will be tested whether complementary demand-side interventions increase enrollment, especially among the poorest households, and if demand-side interventions have an effect on the impact of the intervention.
