abstract: "In this study, we examine the efficacy of four nuanced language interventions in job postings within male-dominated fields, aiming to attract female applicants. Utilizing a discrete choice experiment with over 5,000 participants across five Latin American countries, we investigate two mechanisms: gender stereotypes and the employment of inclusive language. Our findings indicate that both male and female participants value informative and inclusive language, with women exhibiting greater sensitivity. The impact of supplementary words in an advertisement is pronounced when inclusive language is subtle but diminishes with stronger inclusivity signals. This research underscores the significance of language and information presentation in job advertisements for fostering a gender-balanced workforce."
