abstract: "Despite efforts to narrow the gender gap in the labor market, wage disparities between men and women persist, particularly in fields like STEM. These disparities can be attributed to differences in human capital accumulation and occupational segregation, but also to psychological factors. This project investigates whether mentoring programs targeted at female students can mitigate these gender disparities by addressing these psychological factors. We conduct a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) in Southern Italy, where applicants are randomly assigned to a mentoring program where students interact with a female mentor over a six-month period. We then track participants over time to assess the program's impact on their beliefs, expectations, confidence, academic achievements, and labor market outcomes."
