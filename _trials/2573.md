abstract: "As two primary types of energy consumption, water and electricity have been extensively investigated in the literature on conservation behaviors. But rarely do the researchers compare the intervention effects between water and electricity consumptions. Since the daily activities consuming water and electricity are to a large extent different, their intervention elasticities may differ. With access to the daily records of both the water and electricity usage of the dormitory rooms in a Chinese university, we are able to study both the water and electricity conservation behaviors of the residents. In the experiment, we periodically provide the residents with their past usage of either water and electricity and examine the effects of the different interventions. The experiment setting also allows us to study the spillover effect of pro-environmental interventions. We estimate the direction and magnitude of the spillover effects."
