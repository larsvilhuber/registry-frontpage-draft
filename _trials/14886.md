abstract: "In collaboration with the Government of Sierra Leone, we are testing the efficacy of SMS reminders for childhood vaccination in an urban population with strong mobile phone penetration. Caregivers in 30 clinics in greater Freetown will be randomly assigned to receive SMS reminders or no reminders (control). To explore potential spillovers in the information communicated by reminders, an additional 30 clinics are randomly assigned to a pure control in which no caregivers receive SMS reminders. Caregiversâ€™ contact information is necessary to send SMS reminders, and as of yet this information is not already available in a digitized format in Sierra Leone. As such, a key component of this research project is the implementation of standardized procedures for recording and digitizing contact information, which will inform the feasibility of future scale-up.
