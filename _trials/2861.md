abstract: "The proposed impact evaluation seeks to unveil the welfare outcomes of the Subnational Transport Support Program Project in Peru, a comprehensive rural transport project financed jointly by the IADB and the World Bank. It is expected that these interventions, while having clear results on road users, can also generate a series of impacts on the people that live in the areas of influence of the rehabilitated roads. Among these impacts, improvements in access to health, education, increases in household income, and improved access to markets and off-farm employment may directly contribute to poverty reduction and inclusive growth. We will take advantage of a prioritization ranking used by the government for the selection of roughly 95 rural roads for rehabilitation, and will create control group of similar size with rural roads that nearly missed being selected. For each treatment and control rural road, we will survey two communities, one closer to the district capital and one farther from the district capital. In each community we will survey at baseline and at endline a total of 7 households and 1 community leader, for a total of 2,600 households and 380 community leaders surveyed. We will also have a baseline, three midline, and one endline surveys measuring outcomes at the road level, including travel time, road conditions, transport costs, and local prices. In addition to the main intervention, we will use randomized controlled trials to assess the impact of two additional interventions, one that provides support services to local farmers in order to improve productivity and take advantage of lower transport costs, and one that provides capacity building to local micro-enterprises that carry out the routine maintenance of the rural roads."
