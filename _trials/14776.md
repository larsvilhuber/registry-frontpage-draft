abstract: "In this project, we conduct a survey experiment with French economists who express opposing political orientations. Our experiment includes both a social task and a risk task. In the social task, respondents are presented with a series of decisions involving a trade-off between equality and efficiency under the veil of ignorance. In the risk task, respondents face a series of decisions involving a trade-off between risk and expected return."
