abstract: "This randomized trial investigates the impact of the Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers' Care Management Program: Link2Care. The program targets "super-utilizers" of the health care system - specifically adults with 2 or more hospitalizations in the last six months and 2 or more chronic conditions - with intensive care-management services in the one to three months following hospital discharge. A team of nurses, social workers, community health workers and health coaches, supported by real-time data of healthcare utilization, perform home visits, accompany patients to doctor visits, and help patients enroll in social-service programs. This approach aims to improve the self-sufficiency of patients in navigating the healthcare and social- service systems and has the potential to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient health.

We randomly assigned 800 hospitalized patients with medically and socially complex conditions, all with at least one additional hospitalization in the preceding 6 months, to the Coalition’s care-transition program or to usual care. The primary outcome was hospital readmission within 180 days after discharge.

In this randomized, controlled trial involving patients with very high use of health care services, readmission rates were not lower among patients randomly assigned to the Coalition’s program than among those who received usual care. The 180-day readmission rate was 62.3% in the intervention group and 61.7% in the control group. The adjusted between-group difference was not significant (0.82 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, −5.97 to 7.61). In contrast, a comparison of the intervention-group admissions during the 6 months before and after enrollment misleadingly suggested a 38-percentage-point decline in admissions related to the intervention because the comparison did not account for the similar decline in the control group."
