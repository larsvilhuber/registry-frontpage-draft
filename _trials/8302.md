abstract: "Organizations increasingly rely on teams and the demand for employees with teamwork skills grows. Numerous studies have addressed the issue of identifying relevant skills and the challenges of measuring them. In organizational contexts, competences are often measured by a supervisor rating. These ratings are oftentimes biased and do not reflect the individual skills of the employees.  This study investigates the skill structure of individuals and teams with regard to team performance and explores the effects of speech-based competence measurement. "
