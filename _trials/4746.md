abstract: "This study examines (1) the impact of introducing a handwashing campaign and handsoap dispensers into primary schools in rural Bangladesh and (2) the precise process of information transfer of such practices from the school to the home and vice versa. Using time-stamped sensor technology in handsoap dispensers distributed both at the school level and at the household level to a random subset of primary school attendees, paired with a hygiene curriculum randomized at the school level, we can track the process of spillovers along two key dimensions: home-to-school and school-to-home spillovers."
