abstract: "In partnership with a US apparel retailer with over 10,000 employees and 800 stores, we plan a randomized control trial to study the role of leadership style in mediating the effectiveness of different types of incentives. The proposed study involves the collection of detailed socio-demographic and performance information about the sales associates and store managers, including the administration of a survey instrument to capture the leadership style of the latter. In addition, we will implement a field experiment that will vary the prize that stores can win in a series of tournaments we plan to organize. The prizes will be either monetary or non-monetary. We expect to show that servant leaders, that instill a team spirit among their subordinates, respond more to non-monetary incentives, while non-servant leaders respond more to monetary ones."
