abstract: "I study whether people take advantage of privileged positions to have someone lying on their behalf without explicit delegation. I use a sequential cheating game in dyads in which if at least one member of the dyad lie, both benefit from it. Consequently, the first-mover can avoid the cost of lying by reporting truthfully if he or she expects that the second-mover will lie. I use a mind game where only participants know the state of nature, so I cannot detect individual liars. I use treatment variations to eliminate the belief of the second-mover lying, control for the positive externality of the first-mover lie, and control for simultaneous decisions."
