abstract: "Reducing household energy consumption is a key component to boosting Australiaâ€™s energy productivity and the Australian Government employs a range of strategies to reduce household energy use and emissions. The Australian Energy Rating Label provides consumers with information about the energy-efficiency of appliances in a standardised format (energy consumption calculated by kWh per year). Evidence suggests that consumer understanding and interpretation of the label could be substantially enhanced. The study aims to examine ways to improve consumer understanding of energy efficiency ratings and the alignment of consumer preferences with their choice in household appliances. In particular, the study aims to test whether a new energy rating label, designed using insights from behavioural economics, might improve customer engagement with higher energy-efficient household appliances."
