abstract: "Emotional Intelligence, having been around for only a few decades, is a fairly new concept. It plays a significant role in interpersonal relationships as well as one’s social occupational environments.  Awareness of one’s own EI can improve one’s lifestyle and allow one to think more positively as well as improve quality of relationships. In the following research we aim to design tasks in order to measure Emotional Intelligence as EI has previously been measured solely using questionnaires. "
