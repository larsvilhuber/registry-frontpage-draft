abstract: "Context: The project consists in the impact evaluation of a parental education training program on the development of children aged 0 to 6 years implemented by the NGO Planète Enfants et Développement (PE&D) in cooperation with a local partner, Prayas NGO. The intervention focuses on training small groups of parents on attitudes and activities aimed at improving children’s growth, their cognitive and non-cognitive development. The training will last for about 12 months, for a total of 15 group sessions. The study takes place in the rural areas of Gajuri Municipality in Nepal where young children (0-6) spend most of their time at home and are rarely enrolled in pre-schools or kindergarten. Parents and family members are, hence, the main source of childhood development, making their attitudes and behaviors a crucial determinant of their children’s human capital development.

Method: The impact evaluation will be carried out as a randomized control trial involving 1,000 sampled households and their 3,000 children under six years old living in the rural municipality of Gajuri (in Dhading district of Bagmati province). Sampled households will be surveyed before and after the implementation of the program. About half of the households will be randomly assigned to the parental education group sessions and the other half will serve as control group. The main goal of the project is to evaluate the impact of being assigned to these sessions on children’s cognitive and non-cognitive development as well as on parents’ attitudes, behaviors and aspirations towards their children. A special focus will be given to the gap between boys and girls, given the stark preference for boys in the Nepalese culture and the role of socioeconomic disparities.
