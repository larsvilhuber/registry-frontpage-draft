abstract: " Nation-states rely on a sense of shared identity constructed through narrative. Anderson (1983) argued that nations are “Imagined Communities” constructed by narrative, schools, museums, monuments and maps. We study the impact of a high-school program in Mexico that takes low-income students to visit sites that are an integral part of the Mexican nation’s history. We examine whether this generates a heightened sense of national identity and reduces feelings of exclusion, and the extent to which this generates public good provision, political participation, and government legitimacy. We do this as part of a new program created by the government of Puebla (“Journeys of National Heritage”) that is currently being scaled up."
