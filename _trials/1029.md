abstract: "Hysteroscopy is a frequently used diagnostic tool used in the evaluation of infertile couples and intrauterine pathologies. There is no concensus on the optimal intrauterin pressure during hysteroscopy in the literature. The lower pressure leads to inadequate visualization however hihger pressure increase the completeness of procedure but increase the pain perceived by patient. We will conduct a randomised comparative study in which the hysteroscopy prucedure will be performed with three different pressure( 40 mmgh, 60 mmgh and 90 mmhg). The primary outcome measure was the proportion of procedures where adequate visibility was achieved during diagnostic outpatient hysteroscopy. The secondary outcome was the level of pain experienced by the patient as assessed using a visual analogue scale."
