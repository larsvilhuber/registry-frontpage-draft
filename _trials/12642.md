abstract: "In this study, we conducted an extensive survey in Spain, with a sample size of 3,200 non-immigrants. The main focus of our research was to explore the native population's perspectives on immigration and how these perceptions affect their preferences regarding both migration policies and the labor integration of immigrants. Given the significant impact of immigration on Spain's demographic landscape and its integration into society, our survey aimed to collect detailed and quantitative data on how natives perceive various aspects of immigration, including the number of immigrants, their origins, unemployment rates, and educational backgrounds. A central aspect of our analysis was to compare these perceptions with actual realities to determine their accuracy. We also explored respondents' attitudes toward a range of policies, including migration policies and labor market integration policies. This comprehensive approach allowed us to examine support for policies aimed at attracting and integrating immigrants into Spanish society. To establish causality in these relationships, we implemented two randomized information treatments. "
