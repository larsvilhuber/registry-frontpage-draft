abstract: "The accuracy of voters’ beliefs is crucial for the efficiency of democracy. Yet, “fake news” and “alternative facts” are gaining prominence in politics (Alcott & Gentzkow, 2017). May fact-checking be a viable response to the spread of misinformation? The project aims to shed light on this issue by looking at whether and how Italian MPs respond to fact-checking of their statements. The research design will rely on a novel randomized field experiment in collaboration with the leading Italian fact-checking company."
