abstract: "There is a growing interest in the role that the internet and social media (such as Facebook) play in political campaigns and elections. The aim of our project is to describe how voters respond to positive and negative advertising regarding politically relevant topics. We also aim to estimate the effect of (negative or positive) advertising on voting outcomes (turnout and candidate choice). We plan to collect data from the United States, in the weeks encompassing the 2018 US Mid-Term Elections, through an online experiment measuring individual responses to positive and negative advertising on socially relevant topics. We shall then combine this data with online advertising prices collected on Facebook. As we have shown in a previous paper (Cuevas et al., 2018), these prices can be used as a proxy for the intensity whereby political campaigns target individual users on social media. "
