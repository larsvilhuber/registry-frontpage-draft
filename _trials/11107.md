abstract: "In contrast to standard economic theory, many economic experiments report peer effects on individual choices under risk, suggesting individuals have peer-dependent risk preferences. At the same time, tools to discuss peer-dependent risk preferences are limited and often arbitrary. Based on a model of peer-dependent reference points, we conduct two experiments -- a peer experiment and a control experiment. Building on a within-subjects design, participants will face Multiple Price Lists (MPLs) while merely observing what another participant (Peer) earns. We test peer effects on individual choice under risk in settings where ranks can and cannot reverse. We conduct another experiment to control for other confounding factors that could drive participant behavior."
