abstract: "This study examines how AI performance metrics affects police prediction of re-arrests using an online randomized survey. Studies have found that base commercial risk assessment softwares are no more accurate or fairer than predictions made by people with little or no criminal justice expertise. However, algorithms do outperform human predictions of recidivism when enriched set of risk factors are included in the model. This study examines how police predication compares with algorithms and whether predictions differ when race/ethnicity is provided, and the accuracy of the algorithm by race/ethnicity.
