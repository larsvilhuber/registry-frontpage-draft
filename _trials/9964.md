abstract: "The Shia-Sunni sectarian divide within Islam has recently become of great importance economically and politically, not just in the Middle East but globally. We aim to implement a pilot to increase contact in a very natural setting (mosques) in Pakistan. We aim to and evaluate its effect on beliefs and preferences of mosque-goers about the other sect as well as their economic behavior."
