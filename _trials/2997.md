abstract: "This study aims to test the extent to which a low-cost information campaign among eligible beneficiaries increases hospital compliance with a public health insurance program in a large Indian state. Specifically, the study will use survey and administrative data, combined with a randomized phone-based information intervention, to quantitatively assess 1) the prevalence and magnitude of out-of-pocket payments by patients in principle covered free of charge, and 2) whether provision of information to beneficiaries about their entitlements and participating hospitals under the insurance program can enable them to hold hospitals accountable, negotiate better, and find the hospital that best meets their needs."
