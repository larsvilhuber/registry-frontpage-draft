abstract: "This experiment aims to cleanly distinguish conformity to in-group norms, differentiation from out-group norms and social learning under different settings, and to use that distinction to clarify how norms change. To this end, participants belonging to the two major political groups in Israel will be recruited from a large Israeli online panel. Participants will be asked to privately make a series of binary choices, and in particular to state their opinions on a variety of policy suggestions, and to choose between pairs of real-effort tasks. To allow social learning, choice items will ideally involve uncertainty about their intrinsic value. Items will be selected based on a preliminary survey, and will ideally reduce preexisting group dispositions, and beliefs about group norms. Survey participants will be randomly assigned to receive or not receive information about the choices of other participants. Those who receive social information will be matched with a random sample of each political group participating in the preliminary survey. Before making each choice, they will be informed of the descriptive norms prevailing in the samples of political groups assigned to them. Comparing the choices of survey participants observing different (or no) combinations of in-group and out-group norms, will allow us to disentangle the three channels of social influence."
