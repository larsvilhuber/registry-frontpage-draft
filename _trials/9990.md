abstract: "Humans increasingly engage with information created or augmented by artificial intelligence (AI). While prior work mainly considers the demand for information, little work has studied how humans process and disseminate AI-generated information once they obtain it. Specifically, our research aims to contribute to this novel research stream by studying (i) how humans process and act upon AI-generated compared to human-generated information, and (ii) how humans disseminate AI-generated information. We will perform a series of controlled, incentivized online experiments. We leverage controlled incentivized experiments to circumvent endogeneity concerns that naturally arise when it comes to being exposed to information, e.g., self-selection, informational echo chambers, and (mis)trust in specific sources."
