abstract: "The slow adoption of new agricultural technologies is an important factor in explaining persistent productivity deficits among smallholders in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Farmers delay in particular the joint uptake of technology packages consisting of several practices. Since knowledge constraints are an important barrier to adoption, effective extension approaches are key to overcoming technology deficits. In recent decades, extension systems in many SSA countries have moved away from “top-down” towards decentralized “bottom-up” models that involve farmers as active stakeholders. 
In this study we assess the effects of a decentralized extension program and an additional video intervention on the adoption of integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) among 2,382 small-scale farmers in Ethiopia using a randomized controlled trial, in cooperation with the German Agency for International Cooperation and Development (GIZ). ISFM should enhance soil fertility and productivity and ultimately combat land degradation by using organic and inorganic soil amendments simultaneously. We find that both extension-only and extension combined with video induce ISFM adoption as well as gains in knowledge. We further find evidence for increased adoption of ISFM practices at the household level among farmers in extension communities that do not actively participate in the extension activities. The additional video intervention shows a significant complementary effect for these non-actively involved farmers, in particular when it comes to the integrated use of the practices on the same plot, and thus, appears especially beneficial for this group. A causal mediation analysis further reveals that increases in knowledge explain part of the treatment effects on adoption."
