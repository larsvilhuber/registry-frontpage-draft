abstract: "In this study, we ask how climate policy uncertainty affects household investments in energy efficiency. We aim to shed light on this issue in the context of carbon pricing, as this policy has been widely advocated by economists as a key policy instrument for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We conduct a survey experiment in Germany, where a national carbon price on carbon emissions from the building and transport sectors has been introduced in 2021, and experimentally vary the uncertainty surrounding the carbon price path until 2030."
