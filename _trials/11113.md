abstract: "This paper studies the impact of ChatGPT on policy debates. I am planning to run a randomized control trial in a real debating competition involving 120 undegraduate students from Esade Business School. About half of the students - the treatment group - will be randomly assigned a short training of ChatGPT and will be allowed to use it as support throughout three rounds of one-to-one debates. The other half of students, the control group, will only be allowed to use conventional internet access to prepare the debates. I will be testing (a) whether the chat improves debating skills of participants; (b) whether it contributes to reduce inequality in debating skills; (c) whether it favors evidence-based policy positions and (d) whether it contributes to changing beliefs of debate participants.
