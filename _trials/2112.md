abstract: "This study provides experimental evidence on the effect of peer pressure on individual behavior by seeing being exposed to an observer increases the probability of handwashing. The results indicate that being exposed to an observer does increase this probability by 13 percentage points and the probability of urinal flushing by 15 percentage points."
