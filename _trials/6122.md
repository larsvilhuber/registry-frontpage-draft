abstract: "In this study we designed five incentive treatments to evaluate their effectiveness for firms to provide information in an large-scale survey. A novel method is that we invite a part of the firms to advertise their business on our website as an incentive. In another treatment, we use the authority of an important institution that explicitly calls for participation. The third treatment provides firms industry reports as an incentive to participate. All these treatments are based on the baseline treatment, where we only invite firms to participate in a short message without any additional incentive. In the final treatment we extend this short message with information about the research program but no additional incentives. This is related to the letter treatments in Dwenger et al. (2016), De Neve et al. (2019), and Chetty et al. (2014)."
