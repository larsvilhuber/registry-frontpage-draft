abstract: "There is evidence that women who own and operate small and medium enterprises receive relatively less bank financing in many emerging markets, including Vietnam. In this study we consider and test the impact of bonus incentives to a bank's lending agents for lending to women owned and operated small and medium enterprises (WSMEs)."
