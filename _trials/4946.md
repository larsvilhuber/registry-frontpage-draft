abstract: "The World Bank supports efforts to end conflict and realize economic recovery in Eastern DRC through the Productive Opportunities for Stabilization and Recovery in the DRC (STEP, in its French acronym) program. STEP notably contains a labor-intensive public works (LIPW) component, sought to increase resilience and livelihoods in five major cities in Eastern DRC. This paper analyses the impact of the LIPW component by leveraging a randomized impact evaluation of key STEP components. The project, implemented by the Social Fund of DRC (FSRDC), offered short-term employment to the urban poor, along with additional benefits created in order to make a lasting impact (namely an incentivized-savings scheme and vocational training). This study seeks to produce rigorous evidence on the post-program labor market and economic welfare outcomes. "
