abstract: "In 2022, Germanyâ€™s Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has put forward a proposal for a social service period to strengthen social cohesion and democracy. We are analysing whether the design of the measure in terms of income and voluntariness has an impact on support for the introduction of such a social service.

We conduct a survey experiment employing a between-subjects design with a representative sample of full- and part-time employees in Germany. Participants are randomly assigned to one of 4 treatment groups. The treatments differ in terms of whether the period of social service is voluntary or compulsory and whether the participants would earn 2000 or 3500 per month. Next, we ask all participants to indicate to what extent they agree with a voluntary/compulsory social service period on a five-point Likert scale. On the one hand, respondents may resent the compulsory nature of the service. On the other hand, respondents may be more willing to participate in a social service period if everyone else has to participate too. We hypothesise that the latter effect dominates, especially for respondents with a high social comparison orientation.  

Our experimental design allows us to identify the causal effects of two design characteristics, income and voluntariness, on support for the implementation of a social service period and to analyse heterogenous effects between socio-demographic groups and by attitudes.  "
