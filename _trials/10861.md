abstract: "Loss aversion is a critical contribution of Prospect Theory to the study of decision-making. However, previous research on the construct of loss aversion in decisions under risk unveils mixed results. Some studies provide evidence for loss aversion, whereas others show a tendency for gains to be the same impactful as losses. We will employ two representations, gain-first framed and loss-first framed questions, to explore this discrepancy. In an experimental setting, we will elicit subjectsâ€™ general attitudes towards risks and losses through binary-choice questions. We will further test whether the lack of evidence supporting loss aversion in some studies is attributed to outcomes framed as gain exhibited first in mixed lotteries. "
