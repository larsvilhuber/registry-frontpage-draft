abstract: "Old age pensions are a common feature of welfare policy worldwide. However, little is known about the effect of these pensions on the recipients and their families. In this study, we will partner with the government of Tamil Nadu, India to study the effects of old age pensions. We will assign households with a member who is likely to be eligible for the pension but not currently receiving it to either a treatment or control condition. Those assigned to treatment will receive assistance in applying for the pension. We will track outcomes of the elderly and their family members for several years following the intervention. "
