abstract: "There is a notable lack of knowledge on the external validity of clinical trials. The proposed study aims to fill this gap by providing insights into the magnitude and implications of selection effects into clinical trials. The objective of this study is to identify who participates in clinical trials with a particular focus on people’s socio-economic characteristics, abilities, personality traits, preferences, and behaviors by comparing the trial population to a general population (adults age 18 to 65). We will elaborate on potential biases in the estimation of treatment effects. Additionally, using an RCT compromising a control and two treatment groups the study will investigate to what extent the information provided in the clinical trial recruitment process influences the participation in the clinical trial of various population groups.  The control group receives a standard recruitment campaign. Intervention groups will additionally receive an intervention aimed at encouraging persons to participate, whereby intervention T1 will aim to activate altruistic concerns and motives among respondents by emphasizing the positive benefits of clinical trial participation for the society and others (emphasizing altruism) and T2 aims at fostering trust and highlighting the rights of clinical trial participants to reduce anxiety and misperceptions. The study takes place as part of the LoaLoa cinical trials conducted by researchers of CERMEL in Lambaréné, Gabon. "
