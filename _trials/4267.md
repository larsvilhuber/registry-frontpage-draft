abstract: "This laboratory experiment aims to understand the impact of incidental anger on strategic interactions between individuals. It follows a recent view in the literature suggesting that anger is a commitment device that leads individuals to ignore or switch-off the capacity of forming higher order beliefs (e.g. Frank [1987], Meshulam et al. [2012], Van Leeuwen et al. [2017]). In particular, our experimental design will allow us to understand whether being angry affects strategic play and performance in a repeated beauty contest game. "
