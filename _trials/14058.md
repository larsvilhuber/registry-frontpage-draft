abstract: "In partnership with the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education (DSHE) and an education-focused NGO, Global Development and Research Initiative (GDRI), this randomized controlled trial (RCT) will evaluate the impact of the provision of umbrellas to adolescent female students in Bangladesh. Bangladesh suffers frequent rainfall during the monsoon for about three months and extreme heat for another four months. Such conditions disproportionately affect female students due to social and cultural mobility restrictions. The intervention aims to mitigate weather-induced challenges for girls to improve school attendance, reduce dropout rates, enhance academic performance, and decrease seasonal illnesses. The study will involve 500 secondary schools and approximately 6,000 female students. By providing experimental evidence on this low-cost intervention, the study intends to demonstrate scalable solutions to improve educational outcomes for girls in environmentally challenging settings."
