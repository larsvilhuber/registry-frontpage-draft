abstract: "Child marriage severely affects female well-being across the developing world, yet its causes remain poorly understood. Research that does examine the causes of child marriage tends to focus on the role of culture, which is difficult, if not impossible, to directly affect with public policy. Inspired by interviews with local NGO workers specialized in the prevention of child marriage we examine whether increasing information about police enforcement of child marriage laws can reduce child marriage in the Indian state of Bihar. To do so we will implement two randomized controlled trials. In the first experiment we randomly send messages about the fact that child marriage is illegal and subject to police enforcement and legal punishment to village leaders and development officials across the entire state of Bihar. In the second experiment we complement these phone messages by selecting a smaller subset of villages and randomly assigning village leaders and development official to a training about the police enforcement aspects of child marriage. In both cases the control group receives no messages and no trainings. In both experiments we have a control group that received no treatment, and a second treatment arm that receives information/training about the negative effects of child marriage for girls, but no information about police enforcement. This latter treatment arm will allow us to separate the effect of police enforcement information from a general increase in the latency of the issue of child marriage. To measure child marriage we implement a household survey (for the second experiment), and use data from the Indian Census and the Indian National Family Health Survey. "
