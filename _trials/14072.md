abstract: "Our study aims to analyze the role of social norms for recycling. The study has two stages. In the first stage, we will run an online survey to collect information on personal and social norms. In the second stage, we will run a field experiment to analyze if providing information about others' social norms can affect participation in waste sorting. 

Citizens of Palma must scan a card that identifies them in order to use the bins meant for bio-waste sorting. We partnered with the city's waste management company to get access to such data. The main goal is to study how the participants' use of the bio-waste sorting bins is affected by beliefs on prescriptive social norms and by receiving information about othersâ€™ beliefs on these norms. The participants will be randomly allocated to control (no information on prescriptive social norms) or treatment group (information on prescriptive social norms). "
