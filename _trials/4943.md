abstract: "There are two branches of this study, each will be written as its own paper. The first will assess the impact of receiving a health shock on different lifestyle behaviour outcomes; it will also study how the response to the shock may vary across different behaviours. The
health shock will be modelled as a signal (information) of the relationship between different lifestyle behaviours and health, as well as a signal on health status. The outcomes will be diet, exercise, smoking, and alcohol consumption.

The second study, which will build upon the first, shall investigate how much the (Big 5) personality characteristics can explain variation in changes to lifestyle behaviours that are expected to be found in the first study. In other words, the second study will try to provide
a possible explanation for why some individuals do make successful lifestyle changes after a health shock given that there is literature suggesting that many people do not."
