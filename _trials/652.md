abstract: "There is a large market for education services for children in the developing world, with many services being provided by private education service providers. Yet little is known about how prices influence demand and utilization of these services. This study explores this issue by examining demand for tutoring services among middle school children in India. Through a two-part pricing design, we investigate how prices influence the number and composition of those willing to take up the services, whether prices can induce more frequent attendance through a psychological effect, and whether treatment effects are heterogeneous by willingness to pay. In addition, given the gender differences prevalent in educational attainment in India, particularly among older children, we explore differential effects that pricing policy can have on children based on their age and gender."
