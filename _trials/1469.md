abstract: "A large literature examines performance pay for managers in the private sector, but little is known about performance pay for managers in public sector bureaucracies. In this paper, researchers study performance incentives rewarding school administrators for reducing anemia among their students. This study is part of a larger randomized control trial “Paying for Performance and Cost Effectiveness of Strategies to Combat Anemia in China.” which was implemented in Northwest China. The trial involved a total of 300 primary schools across Qinghai, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces. It was designed as a cluster randomized trial with 300 schools randomly allocated to one of five performance incentive arms: Arm 1: Budget Support and Information Only (65 Schools); Arm 2: Large Anemia Reduction Incentive (65 Schools); Arm 3: Small Anemia Reduction Incentive (40 Schools); Arm 4: Test Score Incentive (65 schools); and Arm 5: Dual Incentive Principals (65 schools). Each of these arms had two orthogonally assigned block-grant arms: a “small” block grant group and a “large” block grant group, resulting in 10 experimental groups. 

The study discussed in this paper focuses only Arms 1, 2, and 3. Randomly assigning 170 schools to three performance incentive levels and two orthogonal sizes of unconditional grants, researchers analyze performance pay and its complementarity with discretionary resources. They find that both large incentives and larger unconditional grants reduced anemia substantially, but incentives were more cost-effective. Performance incentives led administrators to innovate by working with parents, mitigating potentially offsetting compensatory behavior among households. Researchers also find that larger unconditional grants completely crowded-out the effect of incentives. Their findings suggest that performance incentives can be effective in bureaucratic environments – but also that discretionary resources can fully crowd-out their effect.

The remaining 130 of 300 schools were allocated to two other experimental Arms, where school administrators were offered incentives to based on test scores and “dual” incentives based on both anemia reduction and test score improvement. The results for these study arms are reported in a companion paper (Miller, G., Sylvia, S., Vera-Hernandez, M. (2015). “Multiple Tasks and Multiple Rewards: Experimental Evidence on Performance Incentives, Alignment and Complementarity from Chinese Schools.” Working paper).

Note, the original trial was registered on October 12, 2012 in the J-Pal Hypothesis Registry because the AEA RCT Registry did not exist at that time (https://www.povertyactionlab.org/Hypothesis-Registry).
