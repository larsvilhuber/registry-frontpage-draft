abstract: "The Barcelona City council launched in 2015 a Housing First pilot programme to test a new approach to help homeless people in the city. The pilot programme, similar to other Housing First programmes, provides secure housing to long-term rough sleepers with no housing readiness requirements. Complementary socio-educative support is also offered to help them integrate into society. The pilot seeks to test the effectivity of the Housing First approach in Barcelona in relation to its objectives. The experimental design of the programme will allow randomly selecting participants from the target population (long-term rough sleepers in Barcelona) and comparing their outcomes to those who have not been selected to participate. The evaluation aims to understand whether the Housing First programme improves participantsÂ´ health status and quality of life, decision making ability and personal autonomy, social inclusion and economic independence.
