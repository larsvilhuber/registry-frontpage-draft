abstract: "The simple RCT tests an assumption that the "flagging" reviews in Glassdoor significantly increases the review's likelihood of being removed. Different from Twitter, Glassdoor does not involve in active content moderation process, and companies should not count on Glassdoor to spontaneously take down their unfavorable reviews. Any missing review is then likely the results of the company's effort."
