abstract: "The experiment ‘Elicitation of Normative Expectations (ENE)’ examines the extent to which variations in the two-step elicitation method (e.g., Bicchieri & Xiao, 2009; Bicchieri et al. 2019; Görges & Nosenzo 2020) influence personal normative beliefs and normative expectations, i.e. the extent to which the elicitation method is robust to variations. To this end, each participant is asked about their personal normative beliefs and normative expectations regarding fairness in a dictator game. Three main characteristics are varied in eight different treatments: i) order of elicitation (before/after the task), ii) incentivization of normative expectations (yes/no), and iii) question on behavioural options (about fair share only/ about fair and selfish share). In addition, subjects participate in an online variation of the commonly used ‘Dictator Game’ to assess fairness. In the Dictator Game, participants are asked to divide the additional bonus amount of 2.5 GBP between themselves and another randomly selected participant. All participants will be paid the amount generated in the experiment (plus a ‘show-up fee’ of 1 GBP). The experiment will be conducted via the crowdworking platform ‘Prolific’ and is expected to last 7-8 minutes."
