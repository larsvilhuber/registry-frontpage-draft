abstract: "A policy proposal that has received much attention in recent years is the introduction of a (universal) basic income.
Relative to existing forms of social protection and redistribution, the distinguishing feature of a basic income is its lack of conditionality: Income receipt is not contingent on requirements such as a prior work history, demonstrated willingness to work, sickness, or old age.
This lack of conditionality has implications for various dimensions of welfare and behaviour, mediated by channels including the bargaining power of (potential) recipients, increased income security, and increased coverage of populations who are otherwise excluded.

In this study, we will evaluate a basic income pilot program in Germany using a blocked randomized controlled trial design.
Our evaluation will focus on dimensions of behavior and welfare which might be distinctively impacted by a basic income, relative to other forms of social protection.
We will consider, in particular, labor market outcomes, expenditures, time use, and subjective well-being."
