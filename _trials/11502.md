abstract: "This research evaluates the impact of the program ‘Hogares Saludables’ on health, labor supply, and time allocation among low-income households. This program, led by Cemento Argos-Colombia, combines a physical intervention on floors, bathrooms, and/or kitchens, along with training on construction, to build a healthy household environment and to boost the escape from the poverty of vulnerable households. To assess the impact of Hogares Saludables, a randomized control trial was conducted among low-income households in Colombia. Our sampling consists of 1200 households from the main intermediate cities of Colombia (Medellín, Cali, and Barranquilla) randomly selected among eligible households with similar socio-economical and housing conditions.  These interventions align with the 11th Sustainable Development Goal (sustainable cities and communities) and aim to overcome poverty and break down barriers of exclusion and inequality. "
