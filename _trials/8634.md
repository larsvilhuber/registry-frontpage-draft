abstract: "The gender pay gap remains persistent in most developed countries and a large proportion of the gap cannot be explained by observable factors. The repeated finding that women compete less than men has been suggested as a possible factor contributing to the lower wages of women and policy measures have been implemented to encourage women to enter more highly-competitive, well-paid, and often male-stereotypical careers. However, literature on backlash against agentically acting women suggests that women who choose to compete in male-typed domains may receive punishment for breaking social norms. With this experiment we investigate how people respond to income inequalities arising from competition between men and women when competition is voluntary and competitors act agentically."
