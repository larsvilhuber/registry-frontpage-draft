abstract: "A major barrier to exclusive LPG use is the gap in time between when a household’s LPG cylinder becomes empty and when they receive a refill. In rural areas, this gap results in return to biomass use for cooking while waiting for a refill. Middle and upper-income and many urban households own a second cylinder to avoid these service interruptions. That is, when the first cylinder runs out, they have a second which provides fuel while they wait for the refill of their first cylinder. In this study we plan to test two ways to increase LPG usage through a short-term field experiment: 1) Examine the impacts of owning a second cylinder on LPG and chulha use among poor households in rural India, where second cylinders are uncommon; 2) To help achieve near-exclusive use, we will test how usage of LPG is influenced by asking households to disable or remove the traditional mud stove. This move – to physically eliminate a strong source of pollution – could be a natural link to a program that improves supply of clean fuel through provision of a second cylinder.
