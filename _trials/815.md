abstract: "Law 40/2004 on the National Social Security System and Law 24/2011 on Social Security Carriers (BPJS) outlined Indonesia’s path towards the creation of a universal social security system. A primary goal is to achieve universal health coverage through a mandatory public health insurance scheme – Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN). Begun in January 2014, JKN aims to achieve total coverage by 2019.

JKN coverage is determined by household’s income and employment status. The Government of Indonesia (GoI) covers the insurance premia of the poor and near-poor, while wage workers premia are covered jointly by the employee and the employer. The toughest challenge will be the registration and retention of non-poor non-wage workers, who have to register for the program and make monthly payments.

Ensuring non-wage worker participation is especially difficult: not only is it harder for the government to locate these individuals and encourage them to sign up, but the fact that they have to bear the cost of their premia, and remit it directly to the government each monthly, decreases the probability that they would sign up. 

The main objective of this project is to rigorously test potential strategies to increase the participation of non-poor informal workers into the insurance scheme. We focus on incentives to enroll at the household level and explore three main factors that could potentially be hindering participation: monetary costs, hassle costs and lack of information. Moreover, we test for adverse selection by looking at whether different incentives attract different types of people."
