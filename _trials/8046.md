abstract: "Reading can only be learned through daily practice, but school practice time was in short supply in the Corona year 2020/21, with phases of school closures alternating with phases of school openings with a masking requirement or a ban on reading aloud. Many parents fear that this cohort started their school career with significant learning deficits, but hardly anyone really knows. Accordingly, the pressure to act and thus the motivation of parents to support their children's educational process through active participation is unclear. In a field experiment, we investigate the effects of systematically varied feedback and incentives on their children's reading skills on parents' motivation and effort to actively support skill acquisition over several weeks. About 250 first graders train their reading skills with active support from their parents in a phonics reading tandem procedure as part of the nationwide "#30-Day Reading Challenge”.  The challenge is to motivate the parent-child dyads to achieve a consistently high or even increasing level of activity over the 6 weeks of summer vacation, while strengthening the children's intrinsic motivation to such an extent that they remain active readers beyond the intervention period. In addition to parent performance, we also measure children's motivation and change in performance using validated literacy tests and weekly progress diagnostics."
