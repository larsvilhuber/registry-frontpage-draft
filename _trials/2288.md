abstract: "The aim of this project is to provide the first real-world, large-scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) on affirmative action (AA) for access to university. We use the RCT to evaluate policy effectiveness without the confounding factors that potentially affect existing observational studies. Moreover, we explore the drivers of programme effectiveness."
