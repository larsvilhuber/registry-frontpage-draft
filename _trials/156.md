abstract: "South African businesses consistently rate their country’s labor laws as burdensome and costly to comply with. However, objective interpretations of the labor laws do not suggest that South Africa’s regulations are particularly stringent relative to other countries of a similar income level. If firms had better information on their country’s labor regulations, they might be more willing to hire new employees. This could include those with ‘riskier’ profiles, such as younger or less experienced workers. There is little evidence on the impact of improving firms’ understanding of labor regulations on hiring.

Researchers are partnering with a subscription-based labor law website, UCT Law@Work Club, to examine how improved information of labor regulations can change firms’ knowledge and perception of labor regulation, and their demand for employees. Using South Africa’s Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) database, 1,800 firms located in all provinces of South Africa and with 5 to 300 employees will be randomly selected to participate in the study. Half of those firms will be offered a free subscription to the UCT Law@Work Club website for 21 weeks. Researchers will then collect data on the perception and knowledge of labor regulation, as well as the labor flows of the firms in the sample.
