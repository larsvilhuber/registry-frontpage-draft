abstract: "Experts must often choose whether to communicate using numbers or language when sharing information with policymakers and the general public. While there are many reasons why experts would send messages using language or numbers, our study emphasizes the role of message precision: numbers represent precise estimates, whereas language is imprecise because one word can be interpreted as many numerical values. We run a large-scale experiment in which we vary message sendersâ€™ incentives to directionally persuade their audience or to convey accurate information. We analyze how senders choose between message formats, testing whether directional incentives increase their likelihood of using language to communicate as compared to using numeric estimates. To understand mechanisms, we also analyze a sample of senders who choose between more-precise numeric estimates and less-precise interval ranges to communicate. We also analyze how incentives affect how senders choose messages within each format, and study how receivers respond. "
