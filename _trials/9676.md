abstract: "In this incentivized online survey experiment, I study the impact of information provision on beliefs and demand for mental health support among university students in Nairobi. A random sample of participants receives information targeting misperceptions about help-seeking behavior, namely, two statistics from two previous surveys of university students in Kenya which report the share of respondents who had experience with mental health support and the share interested in a voucher for a subsidized online counselling session with a certified therapist. Another group is exposed to two written testimonials from students who tried counseling on campus and shared their experience. First, I assess the impact of the information interventions on posteriors about the prevalence of help-seeking experiences and intentions among university peers. In the main analysis, I plan to study the impact of the two information treatments on participantsâ€™ stereotypical beliefs (i.e. negative representations of help-seekers), efficacy beliefs (i.e. beliefs about the perceived need and effectiveness of counseling), and help-seeking behavior (through incentivized measures of demand for mental health support).
