abstract: "The Ethiopian government initiated a Community-Based Insurance scheme (CBHI) in 2011 to enhance financial protection for the informal sector. As of 2020, 8.4 million households were enrolled in the scheme. However, one of the CBHI's challenges is that households contribute an equal amount of premium (flat-rate contribution in majority of the settings across the country) regardless of their economic status and ability to pay. This adversely affected the lower-income households, sustainability, and equity of the program. To address this challenge, a new policy initiative, a sliding scale (SS-CBHI) contribution system based on householdsâ€™ economic status is under consideration. This study is intended to evaluate the impact of introducing the new policy initiative using a Randomized controlled trial (RCT).The new policy initiative will be implemented in both rural and urban areas of these regions. Randomization will be conducted at the district level. A total of 5200 households will participate in the study. Households in the control areas will continue paying fixed rates whereas the households in the treatment areas will pay differential rates based on socio-economic status.  "
