abstract: "A large share of patients with chronic diseases abandon treatment. Although there is a strong presumption that this hurts their health, we were unable to find a well powered study that estimates causal effects of abandonment on health. Our study has several main objectives.
First, to estimate the causal effect of staying in treatment longer, on the health of diabetic patients. In particular on their HbA1c levels, but also on their knowledge, their expectations of treatment effectiveness and of their cost of complying with treatment. Second, to find whether it is more cost effective to incentivize clients to stay ex-ante for staying, or to bring the abandoners back through a subsidy ex-post after they abandon. The later one may be more well targeted, but the former may create dynamic incentives to exert effort form the beginning of treatment and thus may generate less dropout through dynamic complementarities. Third, to investigate whether giving clients personalized information about diabetes and their health increases their knowledge about their health and causes them to stay longer in treatment. Furthermore, to test if giving them an incentivized exam on the information we provide increases their attention ---as reflected in their knowledgeâ€”and further increases staying. Fourth, to investigate correlationally to what extent the probability of abandoning treatment increases after experiencing a negative income shock. To investigate correlationally if they leave after learning how to take care of their health by themselves.  Finally, to assess whether or not they substitute to other health providers after they leave.
