abstract: "Using a sample of employees from several medium-sized companies, we investigate whether incentivizing employees to repeat a behavior several times over a certain period of time can lead to habit formation. We implement a monetary incentive for service employees who report a sales opportunity at least once a week over a period of four weeks. The incentive is available for twelve weeks. First, we test whether employees report more sales opportunities during the period in which they can receive the incentive. Then we test whether they continue to report more sales opportunities after the end of the intervention period, suggesting habit formation."
