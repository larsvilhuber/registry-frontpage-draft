abstract: "This studyexplores the role of the social environment in the transaction costs of corrupt exchange. Through a field experiment in the Congo's capital, we randomly assign public transport drivers to reroute their operations on certain days but not in others, targeting routes where they lack \textit{relationships} with the officers overseeing the line. On these rerouted days, the drivers are significantly less likely to have pre-existing connections with the officers on the line; they also generate  lower revenue net of operating costs (joint profit). By analyzing two cross-randomizations, we find that this reduction in joint profit stems from the absence of the drivers' \textit{relationships} with the officers, and that those provide drivers with the security to take actions that increase passenger demand and fares without risking extortion. These relationships are formed through  large initial investments when rerouting is expected to persist for multiple days. Our findings highlight how social relationships lower the costs of sustaining corrupt arrangements and suggest that expectations of corruption profit opportunities  shape social relationships.
