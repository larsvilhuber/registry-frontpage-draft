abstract: "This paper uses a correspondence experiment to compare rates of housing discrimination in the fifty largest Core-Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) in the US.  In addition to comparing the incidence of discriminatory behavior across the nation's major housing markets, we will use the metropolitan sample to examine the strength of discriminatory constraints in central-city versus suburban markets. A long-standing literature has focused on the effects of housing discrimination and other exclusionary practices such as redlining behavior, which have limited the access of racial minorities to suburban neighborhoods (Lake, 2017, Ondrichet  al.,  2003,  Yinger,  1995).   However, initial evidence from our recent correspondence study in 5 major cities (Houston, TX, San Jose, CA, Atlanta, GA, Philadelphia, PA, and Cincinnati, OH) suggests that the rates of discrimination are higher in high amenity urban neighborhoods than in suburban neighborhoods.  Researchers have documented a shift in the distribution of amenities, high-skilled jobs, and skilled populations toward urban neighborhoods over the past two decades (Baum-Snow and Hartley 2017, Edlund et al. 2015).  Couture and Handbury (2017) demonstrate that this trend is driven by young, college-educated residents who increasingly locate in central districts of urban areas.  van Vuuren (2018) shows that these factors may play an important role in determining the location decisions of workers and in driving the process of gentrification.   We hypothesize that discriminatory constraints in the rental housing market may be highly correlated with neighborhood amenity levels and excess demand for housing in certain neighborhoods. "
