abstract: "Methane is a potent natural gas with 80-times the short-term global warming potential of carbon dioxide. Colorado has been a leader in regulating these harmful methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, but the state still lacks the ability to comprehensively monitor emissions. This study plans to evaluate the impact of a low-cost notification intervention which increases regulatory scrutiny on oil and gas companies."
