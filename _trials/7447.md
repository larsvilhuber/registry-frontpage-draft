abstract: "In the age of information technology and big data, how people evaluate their personal data is a basic and important issue that has not been fully explored. Firstly, we want to find out whether people’s willingness to disclose privacy information with or without facial image are significantly different. So, we will measure the willingness to accept (WTA) the uploading of a screenshot of their current "Epidemic Prevention Itinerary Card" or "Personal Health Code" (both of them contain private information) , whose main difference is whether include a facial image. Then, we will test the “privacy paradox” by comparing the participants’ WTAs in a hypothetical environment with those in a real-incentive environment.
