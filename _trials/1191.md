abstract: "This project creates a longitudinal (panel) data set of Kenyan youth, and exploits this data to rigorously estimate the long-run impact of a child health intervention on a range of later life outcomes. In particular, this project seeks to locate and survey a representative subset of approximately 7,500 individuals who attended schools that were part of a health program that provided deworming medication to more than 30,000 primary school children starting in 1998. The order of phase-in of schools involved in this health program was randomized, allowing us to estimate how exogenous gains in childhood health affect a wide range of adult life outcomes. In previous research, this intervention was shown to have substantial short-term impacts on beneficiaries (Miguel and Kremer, 2004). Despite strong a priori reasons to anticipate significant long-term labor market and demographic benefits from better childhood health, these effects have rarely been demonstrated empirically, in large part due to the near total absence of extended longitudinal data of the kind we collect. Evidence is urgently needed by public policymakers attempting to design effective health programs in less developed countries."
