abstract: "We study a cohort of students at the Department of Economics and Business Administration at a German university in their first study year, spanning two semesters. Administrative data shows that many students underperform relative to the suggested curriculum in the first study year, consisting of six courses (each giving five credit points) per semester. Survey evidence collected from earlier cohorts of students is consistent with the notion that this is due to students underestimating the effort needed to earn 30 credit points per semester. We devise an intervention that informs students about the success probabilities of students with different effort levels. The intervention is implemented at the beginning of the first semester and repeated at the beginning of the second semester. To determine whether and how students respond to the intervention, we measure the students' study effort and their performance in exams."
