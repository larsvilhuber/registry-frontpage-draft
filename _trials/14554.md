abstract: "We are working on measuring early childhood development (ECD) of 4-6-year-olds in India. We aim to develop a scalable, remote measure of early childhood outcomes using phone surveys with parents and teachers. As misreporting of children's achievements by parents might be a concern when collecting these assessments remotely, we experimentally vary the framing of the assessment and evaluate the accuracy of parental reports in each case."
