abstract: "We study the effects of providing postharvest loan to farmers in Gombe State, Nigeria. While previous studies have shown high rates of returns to postharvest credit in East Africa, they fail to detect impacts on consumption, investment or borrowing (Burke et al 2019; Channa et al 2018). We partner with a local NGO providing postharvest credit to randomly assign postharvest loans to groups of applicants. We employ high-frequency data collection and conduct a series of choice experiments to measure the program's effects on consumption and intertemporal marginal rates of substitution throughout the year. We also plan to randomize the interest rate at which loans are offered to measure how this affects farmer welfare and overall cost effectiveness of the program. "
