abstract: "Motivated by the observation that infringing use of content reveals demand and that infringement may result from frictions preventing legal consumption, we contact infringers of expensive digital images and direct them toward a cheaper product. Two interventions are designed to
reduce search costs for (i) price and (ii) product information.
