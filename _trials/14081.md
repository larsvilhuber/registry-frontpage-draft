abstract: "The project aims to investigate how disparities affect innovation. Specifically, the project addresses two research questions: Does inequality influence the innovative process? How do different types of inequality shape individuals` motivations and creativity? To address the above research questions, we will implement a laboratory experiment that exposes participants to different types of inequality - e.g. inequality of outcomes and inequality of opportunities - and operationalizes innovation as creativity. To create inequality, participants will receive a bonus in the experiment. To measure innovation, we will consider a number of tasks that address different dimensions of creativity.
