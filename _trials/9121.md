abstract: "Is teacher stress holding back student achievement? Does stress transmit from teacher to students? How does psychological and pharmacological aid to teachers influence their mental health and students? We hope to answer these questions, by conducting a field experiment with one of the largest charter school networks in the world, the PEN Education Network of Pakistan. Using detailed data on teachersâ€™ self-reported stress, life satisfaction, teachers stress hormonal concentrations in blood plasma, we explore whether and under which conditions do teacher stress is alleviated and whether this impacts student achievement. We randomize teachers into 6 treatment arms. The teachers are further cross-randomized into social signaling treatment using color-coded bracelets that aims to reduce stigma associated with mental health. In the first treatment group, we assign teachers in 4 weekly sessions with a psychologist practicing cognitive behavioral therapy. The second, third and fourth group is assigned a session with the psychiatrist with possibility to prescribe medicines where we subsidize the prescription medicines to varying degrees (0% vs 50% vs 100% subsidies of prescriptions). Finally, we randomly assign the teachers into 4 weekly sessions of mindfulness meditation of same length of time as the psychologist treatment. "
