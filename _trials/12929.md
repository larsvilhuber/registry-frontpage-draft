abstract: "IB theory suggests that international experience influences individual expectations, risk perception and, thus, their decisions. The experience effect has informed the following predictions: a)"Managers with more internationalization experience will show less risk aversion than managers with less internationalization experience"; b) "Managers with more internationalization experience will use more calculative approaches than managers with less internationalization experience". However, in their decision-making process, individuals confront positive (gain) and negative (loss) frames of the specific situations upon which they have to decide. Thus, we explore the following research questions: 1) Does (and how) the framing of the decision problem alters the effect of experience on internationalization-related decisions? 2) Does additional information provision influence how framing alters the experience effect?
