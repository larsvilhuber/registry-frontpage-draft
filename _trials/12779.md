abstract: "Roma population in Spain suffers from extreme levels of risk of poverty and/or social exclusion, a considerably lower educational level and much higher unemployment rates than the general population, especially women. The aim of this study is to obtain causal evidence on the impact of a multi-dimensional program providing vulnerable Roma population families with children with social and individual support, educational tutoring and digital skills training. The randomized control trial (RCT), implemented by Fundaci√≥n Secretariado Gitano, will randomly assign around 170 families to two groups: one that will receive the three types of assistance (treatment group), and other not participating in any of the interventions (control group). We will analyze the effect of the program on educational performance of children and parental involvement in their education, life conditions and digital competences. Regarding education, we expect the intervention to improve attendance, attitudes and competences, as well as a positive effect in life conditions and digital skills among children and adults."
