abstract: "As it is likely the case in many institutions across the world, in a first semester course all students are encouraged to search for a partner that they can learn and successfully complete the module with. Yet, finding a partner is costly, as students may have to ask multiple peers and reveal information. That's why we test the effect of a nudging measure in addition to this encouragement. The tutorial groups of the course are divided into two conditions. In one of them, no intervention is made. In the other, interested students are assigned to a random partner and provided with a set of questions which may create closeness. We are then going to investigate the effect of this measure on students performance in the written exam of the course about 8 weeks later."
