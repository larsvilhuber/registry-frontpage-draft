abstract: "This paper incorporates differential observability into the study of peer effects with multiple dimensions of outputs. It posits that an increase in the observability of quality prompts workers to produce outputs of higher quality while reducing quantity. Based on a field experiment in China, our empirical investigation provides support for this theoretical prediction. Moreover, our additional experiment on the switch of workers from a team-based incentive pay to an individual-based scheme shows that while workers responded to the change of incentive schemes, their behaviors can be partly explained by the lingering peer effects of team production."
