abstract: "This experiment evaluates the effects of an outreach intervention on lifelong learning. The intervention is implemented by Finland's Service Centre for Continuous Learning and Employment (SECLE). It seeks to improve the co-operation between companies and education providers with the ultimate goal of encouraging underrepresented groups to increase their educational participation. In practice, SECLE hires service providers who approach companies employing 3 - 149 persons and provide their services for the companies that agree to take part. First, the service providers chart the skill needs of the companies and employees. Next, the service providers organize an event tailored specifically for each company in which they provide information and guidance on different educational options. Evaluation of causal effects is made possible by random assignment of areas to treatment and control groups. The service providers only approach companies located in the treatment areas. We aim to have at least 1,200 companies in the treatment group."
