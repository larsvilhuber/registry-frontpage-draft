abstract: "This study uses experimental techniques to evaluate the eﬀects of an 8-week relationship education workshop and (randomized) bonus session for single adults (1) understanding self- values and past relationship behaviors, (2) understanding healthy partner characteristics and dynamics, (3) enhancing intentional relationship decision making skills, (4) avoiding destructive conﬂict, and (5) enhancing eﬀective communication. Speciﬁcally, we will conduct a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) impact evaluation to test the eﬀects of a 6-month bonus session as a strategy to enhance and sustain improvements in targeted outcomes following completion the core Within My Reach (WMR) program. Participants who enroll for the RCT will be randomly assigned to receive a 2-hour bonus session 6-months following the completion of the core 8-week WMR workshop. The core WMR program is to implement a 16-hour evidence-based relationship education curriculum, WMR, to single adults that is speciﬁcally designed to address the needs of low-income individuals and families.
