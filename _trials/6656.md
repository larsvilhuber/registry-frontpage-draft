abstract: "This experiment tests whether consumers optimally acquire information about product attributes when making purchase decisions.  We develop a theoretical model of consumer choice that shows that rational consumers should acquire information about a product attribute based on their ex-ante beliefs about it: 1) when it is most likely to be pivotal to their choice, 2) when they are more uncertain, and 3) if they face lower information costs.  We then show that for information acquisition to be optimal, the value of information should increase 1:1 with consumers’ willingness to pay for it.  If consumers’ initial beliefs about that attribute are biased, their information choices may not be optimal.  We experimentally test whether the three conditions hold for rational information acquisition based on ex-ante beliefs. Then, we test whether information choices were optimal ex-post.  If not, we explore whether the bias in ex-ante beliefs has implications for the welfare effects of information acquisition.            "
