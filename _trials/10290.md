abstract: "
In many contexts, consumers often fail to switch to more favorable options.[1] A leading an important example is the market for digital financial services (DFS) -- particularly mobile money -- where users rely on agent to complete transactions such as withdrawing cash from their digital wallets. We seek to address two potential inefficiencies related to mobile money agents. First, these agents tend to be concentrated geographically and offer the same basic services, so consumers face a choice of which agent to use. Evidence from mystery shopping shows there is significant variation in the fees these agents charge and the reliability of the services they offer. Consumers do not always use the lowest cost or most reliable agent, suggesting that either other factors are more important to consumers, or that consumers are unaware of agents' cost and reliability. Second, presumably because of a lack of digital literacy, consumers often use agents to complete transactions that they should be able to conduct on their own, such as making transfers or checking their balances.

In this experiment, we seek to address these learning inefficiencies by encouraging consumers to make additional transactions with mobile money agents. To address the first challenge, we encouraging consumers to "shop around," visiting agents they don't regularly use, and explore whether this leads consumers to learn which agents are best in their area, change the agents they use, and ultimately incur lower costs and higher reliability. To address the second challenge, we explore whether making additional transactions with any agent (either their regular agents or new ones) leads consumers to rely less on the assistance of agents and to conduct transactions on their own.

FOOTNOTE:
[1] Lack of consumer switch can be found in markets for energy (Hortacsu et al. 2017; Ito et al. 2017; Office of Gas and Electricity Markets 2019), health insurance (Handel 2013; Polyakova, 2016), credit cards (Stango and Zinman 2015; Galenianos and Gavazza 2020), paid TV (Shcherbakov 2016), mobile phone services (Shy 2002), auto insurance (Kiss 2019), and mortgages (Keys et al. 2016; Andersen et al., 2020), and even attempts to lower switching costs do not result in high switching rates (Office of Gas and Electricity Markets 2020)."
