abstract: "The aim of the study is to explore differences in prosocial behavior across socioeconomic classes. In order to do so, we did an experiment with 513 high school students in Argentina coming from an array of socio-economic backgrounds. We randomly assigned treatment of equal and unequal endowments at the classroom level and studied their behavior in a dictator and trust game. We further captured data related to their valuation of generosity, trust, and friendship. "
