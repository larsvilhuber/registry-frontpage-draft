abstract: "Pay and work hours fluctuate from month to month in many jobs. A particular case -- growing in popularity over time -- is gig jobs on online platforms. Variation in job outcomes is not a problem as long as workers can, on average, understand and predict them accurately. As a result of limited attention or cognitive capacity, or a desire for self-deception, workers may persistently hold inaccurate beliefs that lead to inefficient labor supply decisions. We first test, over three surveys, whether gig workers understand their job outcomes by collecting data on their beliefs and actual job outcomes, such as pay, hours and expenses. We then conduct an experimental randomized information treatment, in which half of workers in our sample receive information about their mistakes in understanding their take home pay. We measure effects over time on both beliefs and labor market decisions."
