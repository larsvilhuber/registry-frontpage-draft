abstract: "Guaranteed Basic Income (GBI) is a policy that grants an unconditional cash grant to households or individuals, usually every month. It received attention recently as the main policy proposal of presidential primary candidate Andrew Yang. The 1968 Poor People’s Campaign proposed GBI for the socioeconomically disadvantaged. Economist Milton Friedman also advocated for GBI. 

Basic economic theory predicts that guaranteeing a stable source of income decreases labor force participation: A recipient of such income increases their consumption of all goods, including leisure time. This prediction is the reason why GBI has political opposition. More general economic theories predict that GBI potentially releases individuals from poverty traps—where the day-to-day struggle to meet immediate needs means that a single economic shock, like the Covid-19 PANDEMIC, can lead to job loss, eviction, bankruptcy, or reduced health. In a poverty trap, the long-term investments in skills and competency required to escape poverty are extremely risky. GBI can mitigate the investment risks and increase labor force participation in the long term. The opposing theoretical predictions of GBI’s outcomes make an empirical evaluation fundamental for understanding the policy. 

The proposed project is based on a 24-month field randomized controlled trial of GBI in rural South Carolina. The project is a collaboration between Clemson University’s John E. Walker Department of Economics’ and  Anderson Interfaith Ministries, a non-profit organization in Anderson, South Carolina devoted to providing community services. Anderson Interfaith Ministries (hereinafter “AIM”) seeks to “connect people with support, resources, and education so they can empower themselves to become self-sufficient,” and conducts several programs specifically aimed at bolstering financial stability and educational attainment within the Anderson community, including in some instances direct cash payments to individuals and families."
