abstract: "Over the last century, state repression has cost the lives of millions, and several more
have suffered from various forms of political persecution. Although the immediate effect of statesponsored
violence is to quell popular dissent, it is unclear how the experience of state repression
shapes political participation in society once the violence ends. In this proposal, we examine whether
changes in social structure and preferences that are visible in post-conflict democratic societies are
driven by the direct experience of repression and related long-term memory (persistence of
memory) or by constant reminders through political instrumentalization of these memories
(salience).

Method: We design a (voluntary) survey questionnaire inquiring about household characteristics,
political preferences, and how politically informed the respondents are. The study is deeply linked,
and an analogue, to the existing nationwide celebration of the “National Day of Remembrance” on
May 20th by the Cambodian people. In this recurrent happening, speeches are held, public theaters
reenact the killings of the Khmer Rouge, and killing fields are visited (e.g. Choeung Ek).
In our survey, we view the National Day of Remembrance as an event that increases the “salience” of
the genocide. To mirror this underlying interpretation, a subset of participants will be showed the
following a slide highlighting the efforts of Cambodian people to document and inform people about
the genocide.

The participant is asked whether she feels comfortable in answering questions about her political
preference and is free to leave at any time.

We believe that our research has the potential to benefit society in numerous ways. It will map the
link between two important channels of history onto the present, memory and salience, and political
preferences. To the extent salience plays a role in affecting individuals’ beliefs, this has implications
for how public policy should commemorate society’s shared historical experiences."
