abstract: "Unincentivized surveys of stated-preference may be susceptible to "socially desirable responding" (SDR, hereafter) where respondents strategically conceal preferences that they perceive to be socially undesirable. In contrast, economists often assume that the incentive-compatibility of revealed-preference elicitations mitigates the threat of SDR by imposing real costs. One domain in which SDR appears particularly powerful is the realm of politics where SDR is both ubiquitous and well-known by the popular press and other "consumers" of polling research. Moreover, incentive-compatible elicitations of political preferences are not feasible. However, if awareness of SDR is sufficient to de-bias polling information, then SDR may not cause any negative consequences. This project seeks to test the ability of economic agents to de-bias polling data subject to SDR. 

In an experimental framework, we will test the accuracy of subjects tasked with predicting a series of choices potentially subject to SDR. Our experiment will have two treatments. In Treatment 1, subjects will observe unincentivized, stated-preference data. In Treatment 2, subjects will observe incentivized, revealed-preference data. While Treatment 1 will be subject to both SDR and sampling errors, Treatment 2 will only be subject to sampling errors. Thus, differences in accuracy will be attributable to differences in the magnitude of bias from SDR. With perfect sophistication, subjects in the two treatments should be equally accurate. However, with partial or fully naive subjects, predictions from Treatment 1 will manifest some of the SDR from the underlying data and will be less accurate. We will measure accuracy in terms of the magnitude and direction of the prediction errors."
