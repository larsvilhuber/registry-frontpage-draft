abstract: "Can a single conversation change minds on divisive social issues, such as
same-sex marriage? A randomized placebo-controlled trial assessed whether gay (N=22)
or straight (N=19) messengers were effective at encouraging voters (N=972) to support
same-sex marriage and whether attitude change persisted and spread to others in voters’
social networks. The results, measured by an unrelated panel survey, show that both
gay and straight canvassers produced large effects initially, but only gay canvassers’ effects
persisted in three-week, six-week, and nine-month follow-ups. We also find strong
evidence of within-household transmission of opinion change, but only in the wake of
conversations with gay canvassers. Contact with gay canvassers further caused substantial
change in ratings of gay men and lesbians more generally. These large, persistent,
and contagious effects are confirmed by a follow-up experiment. Contact with minorities
coupled with discussion of issues pertinent to them is capable of producing a cascade of
opinion change."
