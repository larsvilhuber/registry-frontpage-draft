abstract: "Poor staff motivation can hinder the delivery of public services. We study how to design information to motivate front-line service providers in a field experiment with Community Health Workers in Guinea-Bissau. Study participants attend a one-day training workshop. We randomly assign half to a module conveying information about program effectiveness which blends scientific evidence with culturally relevant anecdotes. The primary measure of motivation is the performance in a real effort task. This involves phoning households to collect health information and deliver recommendations. We then investigate potential mechanisms via several follow-up surveys. Also, we track participants' performance in their role as CHWs in the months after the workshop. Finally, we follow up with households to measure downstream health outcomes."
