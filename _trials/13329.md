abstract: "We test the impact of an edutainment intervention aiming to reduce child marriage that is targeted at men, at women, or men and women jointly, on education outcomes of adolescent girls and boys. To do so, we leverage a cluster-randomized controlled trial in 177 rural villages in the provinces of Sindh and Punjab in Pakistan, which randomized whether men, women or both genders in the household received the intervention. Survey data were collected from adolescent boys and girls (aged 14-17) and their male and female caregivers. We estimate impacts on school enrollment, attendance and attainment of the target adolescent boys and girls. We also evaluate secondary impacts on other school-related outcomes, on individual preferences, attitudes, expectations and beliefs regarding girls' and boys' education, as well as spillovers on school outcomes of the target adolescents' younger siblings."
