abstract: "We develop a behavioral game theoretical model to analyze the impact of self-selection in a sequential game where the participants can lie about the outcome of a binary lottery. The participants are paired in groups of two, and both members of the group observe the same outcome of the lottery. The outcome of the lottery is either low or high. Regardless of the outcome of the lottery, both group members receive the high outcome if and only if both of them report HIGH. The two members report sequentially, and the second mover (SM) observers the report of the first mover (FM) before making their report. In our model, we assume that participants care about their own monetary payoff and face type-specific lying costs which are private information.
In our model, we consider two settings that we refer to as EXOGENOUS and ENDOGENOUS.  In EXOGENOUS, each group member is assigned to the role of the FM with 50% probability. Our model predicts that (i) the members of the group report HIGH in case of a low outcome if and only if their lying costs are below a certain threshold, and (ii) that the threshold is higher for SMs, i.e. that, for any given distribution of lying costs, the lying probability of SMs after HIGH by FMs is higher than the lying probability of FMs.
In ENDOGENOUS, one of the two group members is assigned, with 50% probability, to the role of the principal and the other group member to the role of the agent. The principal can decide between the role of FM and SM. The agent is informed that the principal decides on the order of moves. Our theoretical model provides three insights on the self-selection of principals: Principals with low lying costs self-select to the role of FM and report HIGH. Principals with intermediate lying costs self-select to the role of SM and report HIGH after HIGH by the FM. Principals with high lying costs are indifferent between the roles of FM and SM and report LOW in any case.
Our main research question is how the endogeneity of the order of moves influences the overall frequency of two HIGH reports in case the outcome of the lottery is LOW (that is, the frequency of unjustified high prizes). The model shows that this depends on how those principals with high lying costs who are indifferent between the roles of FM and SM.
Our experimental design follows closely the model (see the “Intervention” below for details).
