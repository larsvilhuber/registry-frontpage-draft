abstract: "This study investigates a new, psychological, explanation for the fact that the unraveling of information fails in many markets contrary to what standard theory predicts (Milgrom, 1981). In particular, we ask whether it may be that agents are able to interpret skeptically the lack of evidence, but may not want to do so when the unraveling process leads to undesirable truth. To study whether having preferences over belief can explain failure of unraveling, we use a laboratory experiment in the context of a Sender-Receiver game. In a "neutral treatment", we will see if the  Receiver is able to undo the Sender's communication strategy to discover the truth as predicted by economic theory. In a "loaded treatment", we will see if this reasoning is made harder by the fact that the information disclosed is about the  Receiver's own performance in an IQ-test. We also manipulate exogenously how the lack of evidence should be theoretically interpreted by the Receiver or, said differently, whether being skeptical is psychologically detrimental or beneficial for the  Receiver. The resulting dataset will allow us to investigate whether agents are be cognitively able but psychologically reluctant to interpret skeptically the lack of evidence."
