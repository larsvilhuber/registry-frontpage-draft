abstract: "We randomize website visitors interested in a car insurance to offers that vary two aspects of the insurance: the default deductible and the price menu. The pre-selected default deductible was randomly set to either 4000NOK, 6000NOK or 8000NOK.  The price of the insurance premium randomly varied to be either -8%, -4%, 0, +4%, +8% of the normal price. 

This design allows us to study a number of questions, both in the short term and slightly longer horizon. 

In the short term, we will use the price variation to estimate the price elasticity of demand.  We will also investigate whether the default deductible affects the likelihood to purchase insurance. Moreover, we will study whether the default deductible affects the choice of deductible, and our expectation here - based on earlier findings documenting status-quo bias - is that a higher default deductible leads to a higher chosen deductible, and thus less insurance cover. 

In the long term we will investigate how the treatments impact insurance claims, customer churn and overall profitability, with a particular focus on how the price dimension impacts selection (adverse or advantageous) and how the default deductible dimension impacts moral hazard. "
