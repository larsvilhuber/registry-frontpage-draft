abstract: "Students enter each course with an expectation about their academic performance, which is often an overestimation of their actual performance. Factors often attributed to such mismatch between the expected and actual performance are students' ex-ante overconfidence, incomplete and inaccurate information, inability to distinguish between expectations and aspirations, and other behavioral biases like present biasness, status-quo or limited attention. Using a field experiment, this paper studies the effectiveness of a non-binding pledge at mitigating these behavioral biases and its effect on students' effort, persistence and performance in the course. We also study whether varying social distance between the pledger and the pledgee affects the outcome of our intervention."
