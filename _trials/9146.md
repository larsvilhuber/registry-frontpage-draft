abstract: "Recent research suggests that numerous mobile money consumers are engaged in disputes with their mobile network operators, but very few attempt to resolve their conflicts with lawyers or the formal legal institutions. This intervention will be the first randomized experiment offering free access to lawyers to consumers involved in such mobile money disputes. The goal is to resolve the disputes, which may therefore promote trust and use in mobile money operators. Greater access to mobile money services may come with greater resilience to shocks, more savings, loans, and investment. This note describes the pre-analysis plan of an intervention that will be implemented together with Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) and the Centre for Technology Disputes Resolution â€“ Uganda (CTDRU)."
