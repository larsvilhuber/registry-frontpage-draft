abstract: "We study the effects of nudges in complex environments using a novel experimental approach based on a computer game. The game environment allows us to expose subjects to a complex environment and to study a range of novel questions. First, how effective are reminder nudges for getting people to change targeted behaviors in the short run?  What effects do these nudges have on non-targeted behaviors — do (positive or negative) spillovers on other behaviors occur? What are the effects of implementing multiple nudges at the same time? Can nudges foster habit formation to create lasting behavior change even when nudges are withdrawn? We study these questions using the specific context of a home cooking situation. To avoid food borne illness, when cooking at home, people need to know about and apply a range of food safety actions."
