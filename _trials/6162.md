abstract: "Aim: to evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile application to improve the links between STH infection rate, nutritional status, and school performance of schoolchildren in Cagayan Valley, Philippines
Hypothesis: A mobile application will improve the status of STH infection rate, nutritional status, and school performance of schoolchildren in Cagayan Valley, Philippines 
Background: An assessment was done to determine the gaps and barriers in interventions for the control of soil-transmitted helminthiasis among schoolchildren in 20 schools in Cagayan Valley, Philippines. We found out that there was no structured health education program among these schools that focus on the elimination of STH infections. Despite of annual immunization with albendazole, the cumulative STH infection rate (of at least one STH species) has reached more than 20% threshold set by the WHO. We measured the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the schoolchildren to determine the needed contents of the mobile application as an intervention.
Study Design: Cluster randomized controlled trial"
