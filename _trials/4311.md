abstract: "This study investigates how performance information is interpreted and used by employees (school teachers). Using a survey experiment, we hypothesize and test if (a) teachers’ trust in the validity of performance information and (b) their willingness to alter teaching and provide feedback to parents and students depend on whether available performance information shows progress above mean test results. The survey experiment involves seven treatments capturing student “progress,” “regress,” and “no development” for a student above, below, and at the mean. The survey experiment is embedded in a national evaluation of the use of standardized tests within the public school system in Denmark, which will be sent out to more than 4000 teachers. "
