abstract: "In models of political selection, voters are assumed to care about the ideology and the valence of politicians. This project contributes novel evidence on the role of valence featuring the unique context of the South Korean culture, where (i) all able-bodied men face mandatory military service, and (ii) avoiding conscription is stigmatized. Politicians with sons at/beyond the age of conscription may benefit from a largely random additional opportunity to exhibit valence. This paper studies whether voters are sensitive to this social signal in the upcoming April 15th 2020 general election for the National Assembly and regional by-elections at the district and city levels."
