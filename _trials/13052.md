abstract: "We will investigate impacts of various loan modification strategies, using a field experiment and proprietary data in collaboration with a South African company specializing in lending to minibus taxi owners. The lender has randomly assigned delinquent borrowers the option, on an opt-out basis, to either (i) reduce only the total loan amount outstanding (“principal write-off”) or  (ii) reduce only their monthly payments (“payment reduction”) or (iii) its usual offer of capitalizing borrower’s past arrears into the loan principal balance by extending the maturity (“control group”). We will measure primary outcomes using the lender’s data on loan performance and GPS tracking of drivers. We will also measure borrower behavior with other lenders using credit bureau data.
