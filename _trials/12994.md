abstract: "Using data collected from surveys conducted at Arizona State University, this paper aims to investigate the willingness to pay of students for professor characteristics featured on online review platforms like RateMyProfessor. Specifically, the study analyzes students' perceptions of quality and difficulty ratings on such websites and models their expectations of these characteristics after receiving the signal, which, in this context, is the rating. Through the gathered data, the aim is to disentangle gender-based taste-based discrimination, statistical discrimination, and the role model effect to gain deeper insights into the role gender plays in professor selection.

In the latter part of the survey, participants are presented with a video, which may either serve as a control or a treatment. The treatment video educates students about the gender bias prevalent in the ratings, whereby women tend to receive more severe ratings compared to their male counterparts. This intervention seeks to guide students toward formulating an expected quality and difficulty that acknowledges the biases present between female and male professors, thereby mitigating statistical discrimination in their decision-making processes."
