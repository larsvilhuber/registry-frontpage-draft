abstract: "In partnership with researchers at the Mbarara University of Science and Technology, I conduct an audit study to test whether improved customer information about healthcare purchases lowers prices or changes quality. I send pairs of mystery shoppers to private sector drug outlets in Uganda to purchase antimalarial drugs according to randomized scripts. The scripts experimentally vary information about the patient's diagnosis (malaria) and/or about appropriate treatment (artemether-lumefantrine). All purchases are tested using spectrometer to determine whether they are substandard. That data are linked with additional survey data of vendors and real customers. "
