abstract: "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of mindfulness interventions on law school classrooms and learning environments. Specifically, we would like to understand how implementation of mindful practices may improve the pedagogical environment of law school classrooms. We are seeking law school professors who have not previously incorporated mindfulness interventions in their classrooms to participate in this study."
