abstract: "Over the last two decades, developing countries have seen a sharp increase in external demand for land and other natural resources. Despite hopes that these outside investments would spur local development, host communities often feel short-changed by these deals, which some describe as “land grabs.” We experimentally study whether an interest-based negotiation (IBN) training for community leaders in Liberia improves their ability to realize beneficial agreements and forego detrimental deals, related to their land and forests. We use a randomized experiment across 120 communities in rural Liberia to evaluate the effects of interest-based negotiation (IBN) training on community leaders’ capacity to realize their conservation and/or development goals when making deals related to natural resources (e.g., forestland)."
