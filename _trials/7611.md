abstract: "People often behave prosocially with significant costs to themselves. Yet, people behave more self-interestedly when presented with an opportunity to sneak out of prosocial behavior that prevents them from appearing selfish (Dana, Weber, and Kuang 2007). This tendency to “exploit moral wiggle room” is consistent with the idea that individuals desire to pursue self-interest while maintaining the illusion of behaving prosocially. The primary goal of this project is to study investors’ tendency to exploit moral wiggle room in actual high-stake investment choices. Our hypothesis is that investors use moral wiggle room to avoid sustainable investments. We design and conduct an online experiment among members of a UK pension fund to test this hypothesis.
