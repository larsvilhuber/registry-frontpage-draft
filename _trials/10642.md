abstract: "This project tests whether local elected leaders can coordinate technology adoption making rental markets and farmer training programs more successful. The technology I am studying is direct seeding of paddy with a $65 USD manual drum seeder. While growing rice without transplantation requires new agronomic practices, it removes the need for labor intensive rice transplantation. Since one drum seeder can cover a hectare in a day the device is well suited for rental if adoption is high enough in a local area.  Multiple small-holders can effectively share a drum seeder during one days rental. This pilot RCT will allow me to test whether rental markets alone or rental markets and extension delegated to local elected leaders can successfully disseminate drum seeders. If this study achieves substantial dissemination of drum seeders, I also hope to study the local labor market effects of this technology induced labor demand shock. "
