abstract: "Summer Youth Employment Programs (SYEPs) are city-run programs that provide youth with paid work during the summer. These programs have been shown to significantly improve important youth outcomes including criminality, incarceration, and mortality. However, researchers have failed to find positive average effects on other important outcomes, such as future employment or college attendance. We aim to evaluate whether a minor program change, offering SYEP participants with personalized "letters of recommendation" (i.e., letters than can be shown to potential future employers, teachers, or guidance counselors), can improve outcomes for participating youth."
