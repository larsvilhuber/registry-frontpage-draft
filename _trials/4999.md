abstract: "The study tries to analyze how technology, transaction costs, and behavioral mechanisms influence independent workers’ willingness to save, specifically, workers from the gig economy in a developing country. The study focuses on drivers affiliated to a digital platform called Cabify that allow them to provide taxi services in Peru. Considering that, 70% of the population in Latin America are independent or informal workers, and the inevitable expansion of the gig economy in the region, it seems important to study how this model can improve and promote workers attitude toward savings."
