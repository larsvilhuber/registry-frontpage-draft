abstract: "How do past failures shape future decisions? This article experimentally investigates the dynamic role of negative emotions on investment behaviour. To do this, we first augment traditional reference-dependent models to integrate the effect of past emotions on utility. Emotions stemming from past failures linger and affect utility negatively, but success brings emotional relief. Using these portable principles we derive testable implications without imposing functional form assumptions on the reference-dependent utility function."
