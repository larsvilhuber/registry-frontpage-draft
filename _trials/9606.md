abstract: "This study examines the effect of an intervention at a 20 weekâ€™s basic course at Danish vocational schools.  The activities in the intervention are designed to give the students real-world experiences in the industry and a professional network. The intervention is delivered by existing personnel at the participating schools who participate in an on-boarding course prior to starting the intervention. The intervention is implemented in nine different educations at four vocational schools with multiple locations from spring 2022 to spring 2024. The intervention is rolled out using a clustered stepped wedge design. The starting time of the intervention is randomized at the education-location level within stratas. The primary outcome of the intervention is graduation from the basic vocational course. Secondary outcomes are continued education and mental well-being. "
