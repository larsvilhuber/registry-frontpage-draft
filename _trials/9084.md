abstract: "The question of how firms improve their overall performance is of paramount academic importance and often at the centre of economic policies of most countries. Recently, the literature emphasises the role of management practice in achieving higher firm performance across multiple dimensions. This project aims to causally identify the effect of efficient management practice on performance improvement of digital intangible assets: business websites. To this end, we aim to undertake an information provision field experiment that is designed to encourage firms to follow better management practice and assess its effect on their website performance. Specifically, we prepare a bespoke Digital Benchmark Report that enables companies to identify, analyse, and respond to their performance metrics in line with principles of continuous performance improvement. The Report provides information on a firm's key performance metrics which is also benchmarked against their industry peers. This will be undertaken on a sample of some 400 firms in two rounds. This study answers if information provision on website performance management acts as more than a reminder in affecting firms' decision to improve their website performance and adopt web-based technologies."
