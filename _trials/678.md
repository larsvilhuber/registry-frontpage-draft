abstract: "Attempts to explain the astonishing differences in agricultural productivity around the world typically focus on farm size, risk aversion, and credit constraints, with an emphasis on how they might serve to limit technology adoption. This paper takes a different tack: can managerial practices explain this variation in productivity? A randomized evaluation of the introduction of a mobile phone-based agricultural consulting service, Avaaj Otalo (AO), to farmers in Gujarat, India, reveals the following. Demand for agricultural advice is substantial and farmers offered the service turn less often to traditional sources of agricultural advice. Management practices change as well: farmers invest more in recommended agricultural inputs resulting in dramatic increases in yield for cumin (26.3%), and improvements in cotton yield (3.5%) for a sub-group that received frequent reminders to use the service. Peers of treated farmers also change their information sources and cropping decisions, albeit to a much smaller extent. Farmers appear willing to follow advice without understanding why it is correct: we do not observe gains in agricultural knowledge. We estimate that each dollar invested in AO generates a return of $10. These findings highlight the importance of managerial practices in facilitating technology adoption in agriculture.
