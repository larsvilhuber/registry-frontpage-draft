abstract: "We study whether to motivate and instruct on the use of a task execution monitoring and tracking application could increase compliance levels and policy adoption. The application has two types of users. The first with a supervisory role at the educational district level. The second type of user are school principals. The district user, after receiving training on the strategy and use of the platform, invites school principals through the application to organize a workshop on the results of the diagnostic evaluations carried out by the Ministry of Education on a census basis in all high school centers. The application provides to the district level user at-the moment progress of the activities school principals have carried out. Both users are provided with an instructive schedule with deadlines and tutorials on YouTube channels that can be accessed from the platform and from the entire communications suite. All district officials receive training and coaching in addition to the mandate of the Ministry. For the first treatment group, we motivate every week district officials to review the app. For the second treatment group, we send them weekly messages with step-by-step instructions on how to monitor their principals using the app."
