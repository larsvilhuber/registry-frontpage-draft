abstract: "This research studies youths' aspirations, migration intentions, and policy preferences and how different pieces of information affect them in developing countries, specifically in Senegal. We will address this question through a survey experiment among last grade students in high schools in the region of Dakar. Through the survey, we will elicit studentsâ€™ beliefs on their plans for future (including intention to migrate) and policy preferences. Students will receive either one out of two types of information (Treatment Groups 1 and 2) or no information (Control Group). Our sample will be approximately of 2000 high school students."
