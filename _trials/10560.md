abstract: "Children between the ages of 3 and 10 can take the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), an individual intelligence test. The most recent edition is the Fifth Edition (WISC-V; Wechsler, 2014).It takes 45 to 65 minutes to administer the WISC-V. It produces a Full Scale IQ, also referred to as an IQ score or intelligence quotient, which measures a child's whole intellectual capacity. Additionally, it includes verbal comprehension, visual spatial, fluid reasoning, working memory, and processing speed index scores in addition to five other primary index scores. These indices show how well a youngster performs across many cognitive domains. It is possible to create five additional composite scores using different arrangements of the primary or primary plus secondary subtests. The computerized Wechsler Intelligence Scale having both auditory and visual instructions will be the main focus of the current investigation. We can give the test using the Wechsler Intelligence Children app on a desktop or mobile device. Four levels—assessment, measurement, improvement and re-assessment—will be assigned to the test. At the level of assessment, a child will be evaluated by a computer automatically using various tasks; at the level of measurement, a computer will automatically produce the results of the assessment tasks; at the level of improvement, child will be able to improve by watching animated task videos; and finally, a computer will enable a child to improve their performance by viewing animated videos which will explain the right way to do a task when the child will be re-assessed."
