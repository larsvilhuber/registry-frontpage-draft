abstract: "This study has two main objectives. The first is to understand what shapes respondents' beliefs about the gender pension gap, that is, what factors they take into account when giving their estimate and how this relates to their socioeconomic characteristics as well as their financial literacy. The second objective is to understand the impact of providing the right information to a random subsample and whether this changes respondents' views and attitudes about the fairness and impact of the gender pension gap and about policies that could help reduce the gap, and whether respondents' financial literacy matters.
