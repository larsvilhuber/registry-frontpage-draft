abstract: "In several low and middle-income countries, Social Accountability (SA) interventions have been introduced as an innovative approach to governance, aiming to improve delivery of public services. These interventions typically include information provision to citizens regarding their rights/entitlements and local provider performance, and additionally, facilitation of community engagement with providers and officials.
 
This study aims to: (a) measure the causal effect of SA interventions on key outcomes (health status, quality of service); (b) test the effectiveness of social networks based strategies to disseminate information for community engagement; and (c) study individuals’ decisions to participate in collective action efforts in the context of social networks and information interventions.  In addition to evaluating the impact of SA interventions, the study aims to generate new knowledge on relative strengths of information seeding strategies, identifying those that maximize the spread of information through the village network, and subsequently estimate peer effects on participation decisions. 
 
The state government and UPHSSP have identified 12 districts where the social accountability impact evaluation will be introduced on a priority basis.  The study has two concurrent designs – one evaluates the impact of policy intervention that was randomized across 87 blocks in 10 districts (population ~27 million) in Uttar Pradesh, India, and another that was randomized across 120 villages in 2 additional districts to study mechanisms through which information and collective action lead to improved accountability and outcomes.
