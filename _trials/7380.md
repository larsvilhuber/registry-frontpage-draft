abstract: "This study focuses on how information constraints for local bureaucrats and politicians affect processing of wage payments for low-income workers who participate in the Indian governmentâ€™s primary safety net program for the rural poor, designed around the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, or MGNREGA. The intervention tests whether providing wage-payment-related information through the local bureaucratic and political governance structures can expedite processing of worker wage payments, whether there is complementarity or substitutability in providing this information to both bureaucrats and elected leaders, and the extent to which electoral incentives and other incentives to collaborate mediate these results.
