abstract: "In this project, we aim to provide a comprehensive causal assessment of the role of four theoretically-motivated forces that might contribute to the formation of firms' inflation expectations (the importance of firmsâ€™ inflation expectations has been highlighted for other items, such as sales prospects, also in recent work by Bachmann, Carstensesn, Lautenbacher and Schneider 2020). We will assess the potential role of each of these four channels as well as their relative importance through the design of an information-provision survey experiment. The four channels are suppliers' pricing strategies, customers' inflation expectations, competitors' inflation expectations, and workers' inflation expectations. Suppliers' pricing strategies might matter to firm as they influence firms' own inflation expectations for intermediate goods they use in their production activities. Customers' inflation expectations, especially for firms that engage with end-consumers, matter in that firms' pricing strategies might be more or less aggressive based on whether consumers expect higher prices to begin with or not, and hence react differently to the same price increase. Competitors' and workers' inflation expectations might change firms' expected competitive pressure and expected cost of operations going forward, which are crucial inputs to production. "
