abstract: "This multisite randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of the $50 million Community Choice Demonstration (Demonstration) that Congress funded to expand the residential choices of families with children and help them access lower-poverty areas. Through a competitive selection process, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has selected nine sites across the United States to participate in the Demonstration, three of which represent a partnership between two neighboring public housing agencies. The 12 public housing agencies that are participating in the Demonstration and their partners are expected to offer mobility-related services to more than 10,000 families with children participating in the Housing Choice Voucher program over a four-and-a-half-year period beginning in August 2022.  Mobility-related services consist of coaching, financial assistance and other supports to help families access specifically designated “opportunity areas.”

Applying a mix of qualitative methods and a randomized controlled trial, an Evaluation Team led by Abt Associates, in partnership with the Urban Institute and supported by evaluation partners, outside consultants, and an expert panel, will study the effectiveness of mobility-related services in facilitating moves to and retention in opportunity areas. In addition to generating actionable knowledge about the effectiveness of providing mobility-related services in a range of different cities and counties, the study will lay the groundwork for future long-term follow-up to assess the effects of being offered mobility-related services on the health and educational outcomes and economic mobility of children and their families.
