abstract: "The objective of this trial is to analyze the effect of a secondary school scholarship on secondary school enrollment and other youth outcomes of interest (academic performance, engagement in economic activities, and early marriage) among a sample of youth in households that are beneficiaries of the Productive Safety Net Program (and thus among the poorest 10-15% of rural households) in Amhara and Oromia regions, Ethiopia.  The evaluation is a randomized controlled trial implemented using randomization at the subdistrict (kebele level), including an estimated 2000 youth in 116 kebeles in 13 woredas.  Eligible youth will be either youth in PSNP households currently enrolled in seventh or eighth grade and thus potentially eligible to enter secondary school in September 2023 or September 2024, conditional on successfully passing the primary school leaving exam (the grade seven and grade eight cohorts); or youth in PSNP households who passed the primary school leaving exam in 2021 or 2022 but subsequently failed to enroll in secondary school (the dropout cohort).  The primary intervention is a scholarship valued at around $300 per year for two years, an amount designed to meet the costs of transportation to and/or boarding at school for students who, on average, reside at least eight kilometers (as the crow flies) from the closest secondary school.  Students in treatment kebeles will have access to the scholarship conditional only on their enrollment in secondary school.  Outcomes will be tracked for two years using both school-based administrative data collection and a detailed endline survey."
