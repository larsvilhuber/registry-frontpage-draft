abstract: "In this project, we use survey data of high-level decision makers in German firms to provide complementary evidence to the existing findings from the literature in order to facilitate a better understanding of profit tax incidence. We take a straightforward approach to tackle this
issue by asking firm decision makers about the profit tax incidence in their companies, thereby circumventing many challenges inherent to studies relying on observational data. For this purpose, we randomly assign survey respondents hypothetical permanent tax increases and decreases in varying magnitudes and inquire either how the additional funds available after a tax cut would be used or from which sources funds would be diverted to pay for the increased tax burden. By random assignment of the sign of the tax change we are able to test for asymmetries in the stated incidence reported by survey participants, whereas the experimental variation in the size of the tax change allows us to tease out the sensitivity of profit tax incidence with respect to treatment intensity."
