abstract: "What are the implications of widely available school quality information on school enrollment segregation? We conduct a randomized information provision experiment in Los Angeles to answer this question. We provide information about schools' incoming achievement---a measure of peer quality---and a schools' achievement growth---a measure of a school's causal contribution to student learning and assess how this information affects families' interaction with various choice programs, their application behavior, and school enrollment segregation.
