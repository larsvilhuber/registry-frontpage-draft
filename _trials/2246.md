abstract: "The proposed study will determine the effect that installing affordable, high-quality phototherapy machines (“Brilliance”) at Rwandan public hospitals has on newborn jaundice management outcomes, as measured by reduction in extreme bilirubin levels and other proxies for improved treatment and health. The methodology is a staggered randomized controlled trial, in which 46 hospitals will receive Brilliance machines during one of three installation phases (randomly determined), each three months apart. Baseline information and ongoing information on jaundice cases will be collected based on hospital interviews and records. One hundred six “Brilliance” phototherapy machines and 46 light meters will be installed in total. 

Phototherapy is a proven and recommended treatment for newborn with hyperbilirubinemia (jaundice), which remains a persistent and significant contributor to newborn morbidity and mortality. Less is known, however, about how hospitals in settings like Rwanda incorporate high-quality technologies into their treatment protocols, and whether installation and standard device training is enough to significantly improve health outcomes. Therefore, this is not a study on the effectiveness of a phototherapy device at treating jaundice (as this is already known), but rather a study understanding how hospitals incorporate new improved technologies into their medical care, particular in resource-scarce countries. Clearer answers to these questions can guide health care practitioners and policy makers on how to develop effective strategies for incorporating new health technologies to eliminate newborn death and disability due to untreated jaundice.
