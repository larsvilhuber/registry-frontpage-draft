abstract: "The research project presented here involves assessing the impact of a microcredit scheme for microentrepreneurs in Madagascar on improving the living conditions of beneficiaries and their families, and on the emancipation of women. 

The microcredit scheme evaluated also includes savings services, a guarantee fund to secure credit, and compulsory micro-insurance (including a mutual health insurance scheme, coverage of hospitalization costs and optional psychosocial support).

In order to scientifically evaluate the effectiveness of microcredit in improving the living conditions of beneficiaries and empowering women, a randomized controlled study is being carried out, including two data collection phases 16 months apart. The aim of this research project is to contribute to the scientific literature and knowledge base on microfinance and its effects on beneficiaries and their families, with a particular focus on women entrepreneurs."
