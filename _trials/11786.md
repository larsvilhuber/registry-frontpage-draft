abstract: "We study Ghana’s Premix Fuel Program – a large “conditional” transfer program subsidizing premix fuel for fishermen in Ghana. Subsidized fuel is hoarded, creating artificial shortages and prices that defy the program’s spirit. We partner with the National Premix Fuel Secretariat, which manages the Program. The Secretariat/Government of Ghana is preparing to rollout a nationwide program that will automate access to subsidized fuel to monitor its distribution and reduce leakages. Some experimentation already took place, so the technical feasibility of the process is not in question. Following our interactions, the Secretariat is willing to randomize across 234 villages (which will be in cohorts) the switch from village committee-based distribution of PREMIX fuel to Automated PREMIX fuel Dispensing and Monitoring System that come with personalized canoe identification cards. We proceed as follows. First, multi-cohort randomization across the 234 villages (315 beaches) will determine the timing of the rollout. Second, survey of fishermen and villagers to track: fuel usage, leakage, poverty, and economic/environmental/social outcomes the automation may improve, including village-wide spillovers and general equilibrium effects. We implement innovative measures for fuel diversion and quality: (i) administrative data on amount of fuel delivered to the village versus survey data, including estimates of black-market prices and quantities. We deploy Quality Assurance Teams to measure the quality of premix fuel in circulation across villages. We also use high-frequency measures of air pollution by (i) installing outdoor monitors and (ii) use available satellite and remote sensing data. 

We compare two distribution alternatives within Ghana’s PREMIX fuel assistance program:
 (i) Village committee-based distribution (status quo) vs (ii) Automated dispensing and monitoring system (new monitoring technology).

We will use this to document how monitoring technologies improve the distribution and poverty effects of public assistance programs by helping to bring in (or include) poor excluded beneficiaries. Indeed, when and how "changes" in the delivery (or distribution) of public assistance programs reduce poverty is a significant yet poorly understood issue."
