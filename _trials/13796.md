abstract: "Previous studies have empirically examined a hypothesis that high political trust (trust in government) increases the support for redistribution. However, the results are mixed. The novelty of our study is to decompose political trust into two factors: (i) whether politicians collude with the rich and business elites and (ii) whether governments waste their budgets. For each factor, we conduct an online survey experiment where the information increasing trust level on the factor is randomly provided. By analyzing the treatmentâ€™s effect on preferences for maintaining the current income tax system, we uncover how each of the two major factors of political trust influences the support for redistribution."
