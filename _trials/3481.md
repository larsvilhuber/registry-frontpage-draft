abstract: "Parents play an important role in the financial education of their children. We study the impact of parental involvement in financial education in secondary education in the Flemish region of Belgium. We evaluate the impact of innovative teaching material on means of payment and assess whether involving parents by means of a homework assignment affects studentsâ€™ financial knowledge and behavior.  The study is based on a randomized controlled trial with 67 schools and approximately 2,800 students. To estimate the causal effect of parental involvement, schools were randomly assigned to a treatment condition. We compare test scores of students in the treatment condition with parental involvement to those from a treatment condition with homework without parental involvement, as well as to a treatment condition without any homework and a control group."
