abstract: "One billion people on earth currently have no electricity. This project studies an off-grid community-based micro-hydro project in Kenya. Community members contribute themselves in labor and finance towards the generation and distribution of 100 watts per client-household who pay no connection fee and a minimal recurrent monthly fee. To measure the causal effects of access to electricity, a randomly selected group of customers is connected at first, while a control group will be connected at a later date. This paper presents the pre-analysis plan for this study."
