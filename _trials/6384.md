abstract: "How to alleviate learning decay is a central challenging for both online and offline teaching. Prior studies have shown that asking students to finish some in-class activities is effective for battling such self-control problems. We are interested in examining whether the timing for doing tasks, e.g., early vs. late, has any impact on students' learning performances. "
