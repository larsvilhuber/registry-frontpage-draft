abstract: "This intervention involves the delivery of SMS and WhatsApp messages summarizing the study results to participants. The concise messages express gratitude for participants' involvement, announce the completion of the evaluation, and provide a brief overview of the results. SMS messages include URLs for participants to access more detailed information in Spanish. WhatsApp messages include an introduction to the results and an image summarizing key findings, integrating both quantitative data and qualitative quotes from program recipients. The insights derived from this project aim to enrich our understanding of participant perspectives, program impact, and the broader evaluation process."
