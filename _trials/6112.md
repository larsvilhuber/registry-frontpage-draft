abstract: "The mandatory shelter-in-place orders instituted across the globe to contain the spread of Covid-19 have caused a massive exogenous shock on households. While the near-term effects on unemployment and violence against women have already been reported, the lasting consequences for physical and mental health, labor productivity, and human capital investment in children remain unknown. This intervention seeks to fortify the responses of vulnerable households by borrowing content from a proven tablet-based female financial education program (known as LISTA), enhancing it with partner communication heuristics, and communicating these messages via WhatsApp. The program targets minimum-wage households in Colombia receiving pre-existing monetary subsidies during the Covid-19 emergency. By providing families with knowledge to manage their scarce financial resources, communication strategies to improve partner relationships, and customized support, the intervention is expected to reduce domestic violence and strengthen financial resilience in the short-term, thus laying a base for household economic health in the medium- and long-term.
