abstract: "The goal of our project is to assess the effectiveness of an information campaign (as a type of a nudge) as well as monetary incentives to adhere to social distancing measures to prevent infection and further spread of COVID-19 in villages in rural Bangladesh.

We implement this project as a randomized controlled trial: villages are randomized into control and treatment villages based on their current situation with COVID-19. Overall, we plan to collect observations from more than 3000 participants from 150 villages. In each village, about 20-26 households will participate.

We plan two treatment interventions with randomly selected participants in the treatment villages.
We measure health, knowledge and beliefs, and compliance with social distancing measures. In addition, partly from previous data collections with the households under study, but also from a new collection, we have a long list of preference and demographic measures to investigate heterogeneous responses of households in this epidemic."
