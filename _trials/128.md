abstract: "Recent efforts to increase primary school education enrollment in developing countries have been very successful, yet major challenges persist in improving the quality of educational outcomes. In sub-Saharan Africa, high drop out rates, especially for girls, as well as student and teacher absenteeism are major impediments to learning. Many students, especially low-income children in rural areas, miss so much school due to family obligations that they become chronic repeaters. This study assesses the impact of a program that aims to improve student retention and the learning outcomes for marginalized pupils in Ghana through distance learning and an after-school girlsâ€™ empowerment program.
