abstract: "We use a field experiment conducted with 980 households from San Luis Potosi, Mexico, to estimate whether the verbal and visual communication of police officers affects the actions, attitudes, and perceptions of the citizens with whom they interact. Randomly selected households received unannounced nonenforcement visits by police officers. Households were randomly assigned to receive one type of visual communication (tactical uniform versus proximity uniform) and one type of verbal communication (proximity message versus no message). The visits were implemented individually by police officers and lasted approximately 15 minutes. The essence of the visit was a nonenforcement interaction between a police officer and a citizen, in which the police officer conducted a structured survey with the citizen. The survey attempted to diagnose security problems faced by the community and general citizensâ€™ attitudes and perceptions toward the police."
