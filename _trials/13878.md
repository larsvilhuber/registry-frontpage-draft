abstract: "We propose to evaluate the impact of a gender debiasing program on hiring and training among formal firms in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. As part of a large-scale government program that will connect low-skill youths to apprenticeships in local firms, firm managers participate in a series of workshops that address common cognitive biases that may lead to gender-biased treatment in the workplace: selection neglect, attribution bias, and environment design bias. By varying whether firms receive the training prior or after candidate selection, we can separately study how the program changes the selection and training of young workers. Using rich administrative data on firm preferences over different candidates and primary data that we collect through surveys and observation, we will study how the program affects cognitive biases among managers, firm hiring practices, and downstream outcomes of firms and apprentices."
