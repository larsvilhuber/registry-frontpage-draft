abstract: "The goal of this research is to investigate biased beliefs about personal saving behavior. Biased beliefs in this study are operationalized as overconfidence, comparing an individual’s beliefs about personal saving behavior to an individual’s beliefs about saving behavior of others. This form of overconfidence is also known as the better-than-average effect. Furthermore, by experimentally varying the importance to save, we will be able to test whether overconfidence about personal saving behavior has a motivational account. Also, we will investigate whether specificity of the beliefs measures affects the level of overconfidence. And we will look into the interaction between importance to save and specificity of the beliefs measures. We designed a 2 by 2 online experiment, where both the importance of saving and the specificity of the belief measures are varied. The results of the experiment will have relevance for understanding personal saving behavior and for the development of interventions to help people improve their saving behavior. "
