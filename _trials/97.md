abstract: "In developing countries, identifying the poor for the purposes of redistribution or social insurance programs is challenging because the government lacks reliable information about people’s incomes. In Indonesia, the Government had relied primarily upon two basic types of methods to define the poor: proxy-means testing (PMT) method and community targeting methods. The objective of this study in the near term was to help the Government of Indonesia (Statistics Indonesia – BPS in particular) in formulating better indicators to improve identifying poor households eligible for a variety of assistance programs. And in the long term, the research findings will help to inform the Government about which targeting approaches are most efficient and cost-effective, including a direct comparison of the PMT method versus community targeting methods. This research was a collaborative effort between the Indonesia’s Ministry of Planning (BAPPENAS), Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS), World Bank Office Jakarta (WBOJ) and Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL).
