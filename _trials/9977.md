abstract: "In contexts with rigid gender norms and low female labor force participation, young women tend to lack professional role models, have limited awareness of their strengths and interests, and lack exposure to a variety of career options. While students in expensive schools or from affluent families can easily access career counseling, students from socio-economically weaker groups lack this type of guidance. We examine whether and to what extent a career guidance program that advises disadvantaged young women in groups can influence their career plans, selection of professional objectives, and choices after finishing school (primary), as well as their locus of control and confidence (secondary). Working with 12th graders from senior secondary schools in a large city in India, we will use a clustered randomized controlled trial with treatment assignment at the school level to assess the short- and medium-term impact."
