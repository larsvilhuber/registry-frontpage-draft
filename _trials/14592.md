abstract: "Customer satisfaction surveys are essential tools for government agencies, providing a cost-effective and efficient method for gathering large-scale feedback on service quality. These surveys help identify customer pain points and enhance the overall user experience. However, low response rates present a significant challenge, impacting both the quality of the data collected and the depth of actionable insights that can be derived. An analysis of over 400,000 web-based surveys conducted across seven Government Service Centers (GSCs) from July 2023 to July 2024 illustrated this issue, revealing a low completion rate of approximately 9%. Over 80% of these responses were received within the first hour of sending the SMS invite.

To address this challenge, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) was implemented to test the effectiveness of behavioral insights in increasing survey participation rates. The intervention employed personalized SMS invitations and timely reminders to encourage survey completion following visits to the GSCs. The study consisted of four treatment arms: a control group receiving the original generic SMS, a group receiving personalized SMS invites, another group receiving the original SMS with timely reminders, and a final group that combined both personalized invites and reminders. 

The intervention will run for two weeks (10 working days) across four Government Service Centers (GSCs) serving approximately 1,500 customers daily (60% of whom are first-time visitors). It aims to test and develop a scalable cost-effective solution for enhancing customer feedback mechanisms in public service environments."
