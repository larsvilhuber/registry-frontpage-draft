abstract: "The aim of the study is to provide evidence to help the Australian Government improve consumer understanding of retirement income products and maximize the alignment of consumer preferences with the choice of products. In particular, the study aims to test different methods for presenting information about the trade-offs consumers face between income, flexibility and risk protection when making choices between retirement income products, focusing on the comparison between new types of products aimed at managing longevity risks and the standard account-based pension (ABP) that most retirees receive. The effectiveness of various methods of presentation of information is measured by testing consumer comprehension and assessing the alignment of preferences with the self-reported likely choice of retirement income product.
