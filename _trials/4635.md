abstract: "Why do autocrats implement new technologies aimed at increasing transparency - to curb corruption or to create a veneer of democracy? This project studies the effects of technology of video monitoring of election on its outcomes, the behavior of local authorities and citizens' beliefs in one prominent authoritarian regime, Russia. Using administrative data on results of the 2018 Presidential election, I show that video monitoring suppressed voter turnout by 5% and reduced the number of votes cast for the incumbent by 8.5%, consistent with an improvement in electoral accountability. However, these effects were partially mitigated by displacement of votes to nearby unmonitored polling stations. To test the mechanisms and evaluate the effects of video monitoring on citizensâ€™ beliefs and behavior, I conduct online and in-person survey experiments ahead of the 2019 Single Voting Day. In particular, I remind respondents in the treatment group that many polling stations in the upcoming election will have video monitoring that anyone can freely stream on the government-run website. Afterward, I elicit respondents' voting behavior and beliefs, perceptions about elections, and general views on democracy."
