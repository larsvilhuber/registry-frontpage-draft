abstract: "This study aims to investigate whether there are gender inequities in asking parents to engage in child-related activities. Furthermore, we study whether these inequalities vary by (1) signaling parentsâ€™ willingness and ability to do these tasks or (2) by the gender of the external decision-maker contacting the parent.
