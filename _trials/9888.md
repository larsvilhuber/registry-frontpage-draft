abstract: "Firms often solicit ideas from their employees through suggestion boxes, focus groups, surveys, and staff meetings. Famously, Toyota’s production system pulls ideas from their employees that are then implemented to improve quality. Despite the wide adoption of these programs and publicized successes, fundamental questions remain about why firms adopt these programs and through what channels they improve production. One leading explanation is that soliciting ideas is a form of crowdsourcing that leverages the knowledge held by employees within a firm. Certainly, there are many anecdotes of simple improvements that were easily seen from the assembly line that were unobservable from higher levels in the organization. Another leading explanation is that soliciting ideas increases engagement and morale. There are recent examples in other contexts showing that engagement and productivity increase when firms give employees a voice. For these programs to be successfully implemented, it is important to know through which channels they work.  

We are working with the management team of a pediatric allied health services business, where speech, physical, and occupational therapists go to patients' homes to deliver care.  This project is designed to understand if there are practice changes that can make their jobs better.  The project consists of crowdsourcing ideas to improve health providers’ jobs from the providers themselves and the management team, via an initial survey.  In a second survey, we will have providers and managers rank ideas that might be implemented, with the goal of comparing rankings of ideas from therapists versus those from management.  We will test whether employee generated ideas are more likely to be the top ranked ones, whether the ability to submit ideas changes engagement and job satisfaction, and whether prompts to some employees that management is considering employee-generated ideas improves engagement and job satisfaction.
