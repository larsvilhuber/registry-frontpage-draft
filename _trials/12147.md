abstract: "Climate change driven natural disasters are pushing an estimated 26 million people into poverty every year and disproportionately impacting the world’s poorest countries. Typically, government and humanitarian responses to climate disasters are mobilized after the shock occurs when much of the damage has already been done. There is reason to believe that acting early by providing cash payments – before or during a climate disaster – may help households prevent some of the damage. Improvements in early action systems provide an opportunity for governments and humanitarian actors to mitigate the worst humanitarian impacts of climate disasters.  
During the 2022 flooding in Pakistan, the World Bank was able to mobilise $150 million to provide a one-off cash transfer ($88 per recipient) to 1.3 million households from September to November. Given that a state of emergency was only declared on August 25 and flooding lasted until at least October 2022, the speed of this social protection response was unusually rapid in the context of humanitarian assistance during floods. This project aims to utilise a quasi-experimental approach – a fuzzy regression discontinuity design to understand the impacts of timely assistance on household resilience to extreme climate shocks. While there is a large body literature on the role of cash transfers in cushioning the negative income effects of shocks, experimental evidence on the effectiveness of cash transfers in response to extreme weather events, especially one-off cash transfers, remains scarce. Most research on disaster response focuses largely on the role of cash transfers in facilitating recovery from extreme weather events. This research explores the potential for “shock-responsive” cash transfers to limit the welfare cost of the shock through adaptive actions during a crisis."
