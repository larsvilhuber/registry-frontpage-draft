abstract: "In this project, we study the impact of an anti-bullying randomized intervention at schools on child development.
KiVa is a large-scale anti-bullying program implemented in Finnish compulsory schools in 2007-2009. We use the original KiVa RCT data to evaluate the program's impact on children's immediate outcomes. In addition, we will link this survey data from the randomized intervention to administrative population records to examine the causal effect of the program on children's health, education, and labor market outcomes as young adults."
