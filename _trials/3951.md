abstract: "We have partnered with a renewable energy provider to implement a field experimental study to test the effects of image concerns and financial incentives on the private adoption of renewable energy tariffs. To causally identify the effect of each intervention on behavior in the experiment, we will study the geographical distribution of customers and treat randomly selected defined geographical areas, ensuring that comparable areas are allocated across treatment and control groups. In the study proposed here, we will carefully select triplets comprised of three similar household clusters to each
receive one of the treatments. A first treatment will allow us determining the effect of social image (as defined in Benabou and Tirole, 2006) on green energy adoption and customer retention. By comparing with a second treatment, in which financial incentives are combined with social rewards, the effect of each of these two elements can be disentangled. Financial incentives may either reinforce (crowd in) or attenuate (crowd out) the effect of social rewards. Finally, the experimental design will allow us to determine the effects of the visibility of pro-social behavior on local peer adoption. Importantly, the study will allow us to generate exogenous variation in the visibility of pro-social behavior, potentially leading to additional adoption through social contagion effects."
