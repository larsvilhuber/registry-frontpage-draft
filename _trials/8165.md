abstract: "Researchers at GetCalFresh (GCF) and the California Policy Lab (CPL) will study the impact on retention in the CalFresh program (California’s instantiation of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program [SNAP]) of pre-filling enrollees’ six-month review form, known as the SAR-7, with information from their initial application. GCF will randomly assign a subset of cases (“treatment cases”) to be directed to a pre-filled SAR-7 flow. Those not assigned to the treatment condition (“control cases”) will be directed to complete the webform using the existing SAR-7 flow, which does not include any pre-filled information. Using matched GCF records and CalFresh enrollment data, CPL will measure the differences in form submissions and enrollment between treatment and control cases to determine if pre-filling a SAR-7 using application data reduces administrative burden and the number of eligible CalFresh households who drop out of the program."
