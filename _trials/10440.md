abstract: "In this RCT, we address the critical question of how to effectively spur business growth with digital technologies, particularly digital marketing techniques, among entrepreneurs in emerging markets (in our case, Kenya). Small-scale businesses are important players in the social ecosystems of developing countries. In todayâ€™s digital society where most businesses connect with customers digitally through social media or search engines, training on how to use these digital technologies for business growth has the potential to lead to faster growth at a lower cost. In our randomized control trial (RCT) we investigate how in-depth training on how to use social media vs. search engines for business purposes can impact firm performance outcomes compared to a control group. In addition, our research aims to shed light on whether skills training is sufficient to drive business growth, or whether firms in addition need a marketing budget to promote their businesses online.
