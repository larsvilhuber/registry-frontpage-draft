abstract: "I will conduct a RCT to reduce the adverse effect of financialization of healthcare on caregivers' ethical dilemma (e.g., overprescription) and moral injury. Specifically, to reduce these adverse effects of pay for performance, I will examine an intervention entitled "pay crafting." The intervention is the participative management of front-line healthcare workers in setting their own evaluation and pay criteria. We will compare this intervention with pay criteria set by the administrators (based on productivity or patient outcomes), given the same amount of pay."
