abstract: "Managers at a garment factory in Vietnam complain about low rates of productivity and high rates of turnover among their workers.  Based on qualitative research, we found that workers invest little in acquiring new skills despite there being clear monetary payoffs. We hypothesize that this has two reasons: First, workers are not aware about the returns to investing in new skills. Second, they see existing skilled and productive workers as being very different from themselves and don’t perceive high skills to be possible and desirable for them. We plan to experimentally test whether relaxing either constraint separately or relaxing them jointly affects workers’ investment in their skills, their effort, their productivity, as well as their retention and absenteeism rates."
