abstract: "In the past decade, there has been an increasing recognition of the importance of education for social welfare and national economic growth and, subsequently, there has been a large push to increase enrollment and learning in primary schools. Until recently, interventions to improve schooling outcomes have typically taken the form of supply-side reforms, such as improvements in infrastructure, materials, or teachers. Over the past decade, policy attention has shifted towards demand-side interventions, which either lower the costs or increase the immediate benefits that households face when deciding to educate their children. One common demand-side intervention is to offer cash rewards or other incentives to households, usually to the parents, when their children attend or perform well in school. Implicit in the design of these interventions is the idea that rewarding the parents, rather than the children, produces the best results. However, there is limited evidence on whether it is more effective to target parents or children. If parents do not place a high value on learning or if they are unable to fully motivate their children, then incentives provided to children could result in better outcomes than incentives provided to parents.

Researchers report results of a field experiment in Gurgaon, India that offered cash and non-cash incentives to learn either to children or to their parents. While the research finds no evidence that the identity of the recipient or form of the reward mattered in the aggregate, non-cash incentives targeted to children were more effective for initially low-performing children, while the cash incentives were more effective for high-performing children. To explore the mechanisms behind this result, researchers present a model of household education production and find additional empirical results consistent with the model."
