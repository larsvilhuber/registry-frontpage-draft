abstract: "Effective interventions are needed to promote more sustainable and healthier food choices for both human and planetary health. This study will evaluate two interventions in two independent adaptive design randomised controlled trials (one 2-arm and one 3-arm trial) within the same study population (a factorial design is not powered). The interventions are (i) eco-labelling, which will provide participants with information on the environmental impact of their food purchases using a score ranging from A (most sustainable) to G (least sustainable); and (ii) price discounts on alternative products with a better sustainability profile (and equal or better nutritional profile) in place of specific products in their basket. To implement these interventions, we will use a browser extension on online shopping websites for one or multiple large UK supermarkets, accessed using the Google Chrome browser on a desktop or laptop computer. We will assess the effect of these interventions on the average eco-score of the basket (primary outcome) as well as its nutritional content (secondary outcome). Health outcomes of the intervention will be modelled using nutrition scores.

What is already known? 

- The food system is responsible for more than one third of total global greenhouse emissions, while also contributing to land degradation and biodiversity loss. It will be necessary to reduce emissions from the food system to achieve agreed climate targets including a maximum global temperature increase of 1.5⁰C.  

- Poor diets are responsible for 1 in 7 deaths in the UK. More environmentally sustainable diets are likely to be better for human health as well. 

- Effective interventions are urgently needed to promote more sustainable and healthier food choices for both human and planetary health. 

- Online grocery shopping is on an upward trend and understanding behaviour in this setting is therefore increasingly important. As well as elucidating effective approaches to shift online shopping towards healthy and sustainable purchases, studies of interventions in the online shopping environment also provide an opportunity to examine the behaviour of many consumers, which would be more difficult and more costly in physical supermarkets. 

- There are no existing randomised controlled trials examining sustainability outcomes in real (not simulated) online grocery stores. Previous work has focused on healthier choices. Most of these studies found that economic interventions, such as price discounts, show the most promise, and a few found swaps to be effective as well. 

- There are no existing randomised controlled trials evaluating the effect of price interventions in real online grocery stores. The setting of all previous studies on price interventions was either a physical supermarket or a simulated online supermarket. The very limited number of studies on swaps (2 studies) and information interventions (3 studies) in real online grocery stores provide mixed evidence, indicating that these interventions may prompt healthier purchasing in some circumstances for some people. 

- Studying actual shopping behaviour in real online grocery stores is important because consumers often behave differently in simulated environments. For example, it has previously been noted that nutrition labelling appeared 17 times more effective in laboratory studies than real grocery settings. 

- We have shown in a pilot study that it is feasible to run a field trial on an actual online supermarket website using a bespoke browser extension and have learned valuable lessons on how to implement such a trial. 

What does this study add? 

- This will be the first study to provide causal evidence on interventions to promote sustainable food purchases from a large sample of consumers in a real online grocery shopping environment. 

- We will add to the evidence base on how choice architecture influences purchasing behaviours and provide evidence on two interventions: (i) eco-labelling, which will provide participants with information on the environmental impact of their prospective food purchases using a score ranging from A (most sustainable) to G (least sustainable); and (ii) price discounts on alternative products with a better sustainability profile (and equal or better nutritional profile) offered in place of specific products in participants’ baskets. 

- Our study results will also allow us to calculate consumers’ willingness to pay for more sustainable groceries. 

- As secondary outcomes, we will look at whether either intervention affects total purchases. We will also examine the impact on the nutritional composition of purchases and (modelled) health outcomes. 

- This study will provide evidence about the potential for eco-labels, or for food subsidies that could alter the prices of sustainable food relative to less sustainable food, to change consumer behaviour to meet health and sustainability goals. 

How will we determine this? 

- A large-scale cross-sectional randomised controlled trial with real consumers doing their usual shopping over a two-month period on the website of a large UK supermarket. The trial will be implemented using an adaptive design in up to five waves for cost reasons. 

- Members of the public were involved in the design of this study and associated study materials. 

- Participants will be recruited from the UK Prolific panel and will be compensated for their participation in this study. The Prolific panel is not representative of the UK population but provides good coverage of different socio-economic and demographic groups. We will only recruit participants who are the primary grocery shoppers for their household and who report buying groceries online at least once a month. 

- Participants will be randomly allocated into different arms at the start of the trial. The two interventions will be independently randomised within the same study population so that there are effectively two independent trials. One of these will be a 2-arm trial (eco-labels on or off) and the other one a 3-arm trial (price discount of £1 or £0.50 or no discount). The study is not powered to detect any interaction between the two interventions being tested.  

- To implement the interventions, we will use a browser extension (plug-in) that manipulates the supermarket website when participants access it through the Google Chrome browser on a desktop or laptop computer. 

- The plug-in will collect data on product selections, substitutions and purchases. Additionally, survey participants will be surveyed for information on demographics and attitudes towards food shopping and sustainability. 

- We will assess the effect of these interventions on the average eco-score of the basket (primary outcome) as well as its nutritional content (secondary outcome). Health outcomes of the intervention will be modelled using nutrition scores.  

- A separate process evaluation will consider what worked, for whom, and in what circumstances. "
