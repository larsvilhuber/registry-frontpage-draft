abstract: "Credit users are often not conscious of the status of their credit history, this could lead them to take sub-optimal decisions (e.g. not being able to access a credit when needed). In this sense, to ameliorate the financial decisions of peruvians, the Superintendencia de Banca y Seguros del Per√∫ (SBS) has created an online portal and a mobile app that lets consumers obtain their credit history for the last 5 years (including a credit score for each debt). The main objective of this portal is to provide consumers with information about their debts so they could take action and improve their credit situation. However, although 1.3 million Peruvians have already logged in into the portal, only 21% of them have logged in more than one time. This might suggest that a vast majority of credit users are not utilizing credit reports to ameliorate their credit situation.The main goal of this study is to evaluate an SMS Campaign that will aim at increasing usage of the portal and ameliorating the credit situation of users. The content of the text messages will be based on the behavioral economics literature."
