abstract: "This project seeks to understand the role of externalities in limiting agricultural irrigation efficiency. In a randomized controlled trial among farmers in coastal areas of Gujarat, we will experimentally offer direct incentives for increasing irrigation efficiency in the form of marginal prices for pumping groundwater. We expect to follow up this small-scale experiment with further work in a larger experiment with additional treatment groups, and more statistical power.

By measuring the effects of this intervention on electricity and water consumption, we can learn how farmers respond to this policy. We provide some of the first experimental evidence on responses to water prices in a developing country. "
