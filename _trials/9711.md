abstract: "Inequality in income and wealth is closely linked with inequality in noneconomic domains - in particular regarding health and life expectancy: well-off individuals tend to live healthier and longer lives. To what extent are individuals aware of these socioeconomic differences in life expectancy? How should public policy react? Should redistribution policy become more generous towards the poor who are additionally deprived in terms of life expectancy? Should policies instead aim at improving health care access, living conditions, education and working conditions of the poor? Although these questions are highly relevant for society, science, and politics, they have not been studied in the existing literature. 
We address these research questions with a representative large-scale survey experiment to document the perceived socioeconomic differences in life expectancy in the United States and Germany—two countries with very different health care systems and (potentially) different perceptions and beliefs about the inequality in life expectancy, their origins, the role of government and demanded policy actions. By providing an information treatment about the true inequality in life expectancy, we identify the causal effect of (mis)perceptions of inequality in life expectancy on concerns, policy preferences, and the willingness to donate to charities supporting individuals on low incomes.
