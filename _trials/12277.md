abstract: "The war in Ukraine has sparked a global energy crisis. Switzerland's energy supply is also affected. While the winter of 2022/23 was rather mild in Switzerland, this might not be the case for coming winters. Thus, we design and implement a field experiment, in which we want to test the revealed willingness to pay of households for their heat pump’s energy consumption during winter electricity shortages with relatively extreme electricity prices. The experiment will be implemented in cooperation with a Swiss utility, that invites their residential customers with heat pumps to participate to the study. Our intervention provides treated households with weekly high price signals, the households then decide whether to pay these high prices (deduction form a virtual study budget) or to curtail their heat pump’s consumption and avoid some part of the high energy costs."
