abstract: "Belief in supernatural beliefs is widespread across countries and pervasive in the daily life of many people. Previous empirical evidence has focused on the relationship of supernatural beliefs and prosocial behavior (e.g., Gershman 2016, 2021; Le Rossignol et al. 2022). Yet, empirical evidence on the relationship between supernatural beliefs, individual and social risk preferences, and honest behavior is missing. These outcomes are fundamental for economic development and many economic decisions such as investment decisions, occupational choices, and health behavior. In this project, we investigate the causal effect of supernatural beliefs on individual risk taking, social risk taking, honest behavior and associated perceived social norms. To do so, we conduct a lab-in-the field experiment in rural Bangladesh. Our experiment consists of a control group and two treatment groups where participants are asked to donate money to agents who are believed to have supernatural powers. In a second project, we investigate reputational concerns when donating money to those agents.
