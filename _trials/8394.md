abstract: "The study will examine the impact of value chain development by Urmul Trust in Rajasthan, India. Under this project, Urmul will develop and setup a new value chain that will primarily deal in processed wool and yarn. Accordingly, Urmul will collectivise, train and provide input support to marginalised women (in 18-55 year age group) who will form a part of this value chain. We propose a mixed methods impact evaluation. We will use a village level clustered randomised control trial (C-RCT) to examine the impact of these interventions (including collectivisation, skill enhancement and input support) on various women (such as participation in productive activities, confidence, agency and income) and household level outcomes. Whereas, program and qualitative data will be used to understand mechanisms driving the observed changes.  "
