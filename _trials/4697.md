abstract: "Land Market frictions may prevent efficient use of new technologies. We test two interventions meant to resolve land market frictions in the context of potentially transformative technological change through irrigation in Rwanda. Our study aims to provide evidence on the importance of land frictions in a context of property rights, examines whether frictions in the reallocation of land hinders rural transformations, and tests whether a scalable solution to information or contracting frictions can improve the efficiency of land investments. In this study, we test whether (a) land market frictions restrain adoption of a new, and highly profitable technology and (b) whether an intervention approach to resolve frictions related to information and contracting relaxes these constraints.
