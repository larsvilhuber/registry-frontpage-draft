abstract: "Do students in learning groups perform better when they are asked to define a SMART goal for collaboration? With agile work on the rise, team composition increasingly changees such that people are more and more frequently expected to work with others they hardly knew before. While having the broad aim of delivering a successful project, there are often no more concrete goals defined when the team is formed. Does defining a self-chosen, jointly agreed SMART goal enhance project success? We investigate this question by conducting a field experiment in a university course and comparing the exam results between a control group without and a treatment group with self set goals.
