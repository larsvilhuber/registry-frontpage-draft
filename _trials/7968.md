abstract: "Technical and vocational education and training (TVET) has been demonstrated to improve the lives of the poor in developing countries. Besides supply-side constraints successful participation in TVET programs witnesses a multitude of demand-side constraints among the poor. Many TVET programs are confronted with low numbers of applicants and high drop-out rates. In this context we conduct an information experiment among poor, young Ghanaian women that aims at tackling the demand-side constraints of TVET participation. The experiment involves a randomized controlled trial with one control condition and two treatment arms. Treatment arm 1 provides objective information on the economic benefits of vocational training. Treatment arm 2 provides information that shall help subjects to further develop soft skills and, in particular, to strengthen self-efficacy. Treatments are delivered via SMS and SMS-prompted videos."
