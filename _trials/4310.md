abstract: "This study investigates the relative importance of various barriers to quality employment that young jobseekers in developing contexts face when transitioning into a labor market characterized by high levels of informality and technological constraints. The experimental setting is that of Vocational Training Institutes in Uganda. We track 1100 VTI students over a period of 2.5 years to follow the evolution of their employment expectations, network and search strategy as they approach the labor market and start the search. We implement a personalized career-coaching by “the future you”, a successful alum of the VTI. We examine the effects of program participation on students’ beliefs, preferences, search strategies, effort and labor market trajectories. Through detailed data on students’ employment network and socio-economic background, we seek to explore heterogeneous effects and understand whether the treatments improve equality in access to quality jobs.
