abstract: "Peeters and Wolk (2019) developed and validated Blotto games to elicit expectations. In their experiments they apply their games to elicit expectations about termination times of a time series process. Given that in many studies expectations are elicited on beliefs and norms about behavior, in this study we apply the most successful Blotto game of Peeters and Wolk (2019) to expectations about behaviour, and do this in the context of the Ultimatum Game. To be precise, we apply the Blotto game to measure beliefs about behaviour and beliefs about beliefs about behavior in this game. The former applies to measuring beliefs about verifiable events, the latter about unverifiable events. In the analysis we will particularly focus on the quality of the measured beliefs in the context of the “wisdom of the few” rather than the “wisdom of the crowd”."
