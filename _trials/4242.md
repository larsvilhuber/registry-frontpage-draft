abstract: "This project examines why workers sort between different startups, focusing on the role of expert information on different aspects of 
firm quality. Unlike for established firms, where perspective workers have various sources of information (e.g., best places
to work rankings or online reviews), workers may have relatively little information about different startups. In addition, workers may have a hard
time evaluating the technology or business model of startups, either because they lack very specialized technical training or because of firm
secrecy. In this project, we examine how expert opinions about the business and science quality of startups affect worker demand for working at particular startups. Beyond the overall treatment effects of expert information, we are interested in the mechanisms for the treatment effects. Our partner is a North American science-based entrepreneurship program (SEP). "
