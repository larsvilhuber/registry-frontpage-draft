abstract: "Children between the ages of 3 and 10 can take the 6-Dimesional Intelligence Scale for Children, an individual intelligence test. It takes 40 to 60 minutes to administer the test. It produces a Full Scale IQ, also referred to as an IQ score or intelligence quotient, which measures a child's whole intellectual capacity. Additionally, it includes Arithmetic Problems, Object Identification, Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence, Linguistic Intelligence, Spatial Intelligence and Logical Intelligence. Three tasks are verbal tests and three non-verbal tests and test becomes more difficult after first three items. Tests will assess fluid reasoning, working memory, and cognitive skills. These indices show how well a youngster performs across many cognitive domains. The current experiment will primarily focus on the 6-Dimensional Intelligence Scale-Child version, which includes both audio and visual instructions. There will be a total of six cubes with six activities each, with varying degrees of difficulty. We can administer the test by displaying various cube faces. Each side of a cube contains a separate assignment that we might use to estimate the child's intellectual capacity."
