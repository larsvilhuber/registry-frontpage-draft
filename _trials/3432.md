abstract: "Research in the economics of education has demonstrated the students often lack important information about the characteristics of different majors when in college. This field experiment aims to assess whether students may benefit from information about the distribution of academic ability in their preferred field of study by providing them with information about the average test score or high school GPA of recent graduates in their stated preferred major. Several outcomes of interest will be studied, including course taking behavior, grades in those courses, college major choice and graduation. Particular attention will be paid to differential effects based on gender as well as how accurate students' beliefs are about the distribution of beliefs. "
