abstract: "Scholars have found that the demographic composition of teams influences their internal dynamics and individual team member behavior.  In particular, when women are in the minority, they have difficulty exerting leadership and being perceived as competent and influential. We designed a field experiment to test whether gender composition affects individual and group-level outcomes and whether holding a formal leadership role can counteract the challenges women face in environments where they are underrepresented. Over the course of this field experiment, a total of 417 individuals were randomly assigned to study groups with varied treatment conditions. The gender composition of student study groups was randomly varied according to the ratio of male to female students enrolled in the course, resulting in 23 groups with 2 females and 4 males, 20 groups of 4 females and 2 males, and 25 all-female groups. The gender of the randomly assigned group leader was also randomly varied. Groups meet weekly to work on deliberative, team-based tasks and meetings are audio-recorded. Further data on students’ weekly assignments and communications with each other was collected through a group messaging app. Students also self-reported their group experience and evaluated other group members’ contributions in monthly surveys.
