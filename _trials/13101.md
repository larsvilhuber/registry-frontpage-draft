abstract: "As new climate-smart farming technologies become available, it will be necessary to learn which market mechanisms are effective at increasing access for rural farmers. If higher quality seeds are under-adopted due to information, behavioral, and/or financial frictions, it justifies subsidizing their distribution. This research considers two ways to subsidize seed dissemination - using demand-side subsidies to encourage farmers to try improved seeds and supply-side subsidies for agrodealers to promote and stock improved seeds. Subsidizing agrodealers is a potentially appealing and scalable policy option because they face market incentives. We study the effect of subsidizing both sides of the market to learn how subsidies affect uptake among inexperienced and experienced hybrid seed farmers."
