abstract: "The Africa Gender Innovation Lab (GIL) is partnering with Pro-International Health (PHI) to evaluate a vocational training program. This program is part of an overarching strategy implemented by Pro-Health International (PHI)— Integrated Child Health and Social Services Award (ICHSSA)— to mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS. The targeted beneficiaries of the vocational training program are rural women residing in the states of Bauchi and Adamawa in Nigeria who are caregivers of children living with HIV (CLHIV), women with children and living with HIV (PLHIV), and caregivers of children that have been exposed to sexual violence and other abuse, as well as caregivers of HIV exposed infants. The vocational training program seeks to impart technical skills in non-farm trades, such as tailoring, and dry and wet grinding as well as life skills such as problem-solving, collaboration and negotiation. The program also includes the provision of an asset transfer to women who complete at least 70% of the training. Alongside, PHI will also implement a buddy program - where trainees are paired together at the beginning of the program - which is designed to address women’s social network constraints. Two versions of the buddy program will be tested: self-selection of peers and a random matching process.
Using a randomized control trial design, the study will evaluate the impact of the vocational training program on women’s labor market outcomes such as employment and earnings; intra-household decision-making and agency; psychological wellbeing; and adherence to HIV-treatment. The findings of this study will also shed light on the effects of an innovative social network intervention and the optimal delivery mechanism for such an intervention.
