abstract: "In this study we explore the links between marital satisfaction and how married couple's approach decision-making under risk. We plan to give out online surveys and conduct online experiments with participants through WeChat video chat. We plan to recruit 100 pairs of Chinese married couples who are both in their first marriage. Couples will first make some economic decisions apart, then brought together to make these choices together. Half of the couples will be informed what their partner chose before they decide together; the other half will not be informed. We are interested in whether a marriage where couples' decision making tends to be wife-dominant or husband-dominant is associated with higher marital happiness, and whether awareness of one's partner's preferences influence the decision-making process and decision outcomes."
