abstract: "Studies show that 500 to 800 million of the world’s poor have gained access to finance in the last few decades (Deb and Kubzansky, 2012). However, evidence indicates that many of these individuals lack the skills to interact with the increasingly complex financial products and services. In this study, we plan to conduct an intervention that includes (1) training and incentivizing Banking Correspondent Agents, and (2) providing financial information via mobile phone to customers in Andhra Pradesh, India. In so doing, we aim to test whether we see changes in financial knowledge, habits, and outcomes both among the BCAs and among the customers.  This study was abandoned in 2014 due the unanticipated separation of the state of Andhra Pradesh into two states. Due to this seperation, the integrity of our randomization could not remain intact, nor were our partner organizations willing to proceed. "
