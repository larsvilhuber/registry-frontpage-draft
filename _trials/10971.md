abstract: "We propose a field experiment in Dhaka, Bangladesh to identify a novel form of labor market discrimination, "Paternalistic Discrimination," the preferential hiring of male workers to protect female workers from jobs perceived as harmful or difficult. We observe real application and hiring decisions for a night-shift job and experimentally vary whether hiring managers or workers are informed about safe employee transport home, thereby observing both supply and demand responses to perceived increases in female employee welfare.
