abstract: "Institutions are important determinants of social preferences. This project investigates the causal effects that the organization and structure of property rights institutions have on distributive preferences. Specifically, we study a reform of property rights over land implemented in West Africa, that transformed collective and informal rights over land in a system akin to formalized private ownership.  We test whether experiencing the reform shaped distributive preferences and how different sources of inequality (merit or luck) affect inequality acceptance."
