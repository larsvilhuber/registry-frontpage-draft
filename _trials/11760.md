abstract: "In this research, our goal is to explore the distribution of donor types within a donor population. Our method includes comparing situations where participants have full knowledge of all theoretically important variables for a donation decision with those where such information needs to be gathered. Based on standard theories of giving, we predict which type of donor should seek out which specific pieces of information. Upon obtaining the required information, participants decide the amount of money they wish to donate to a single charity recipient they have been paired with. After classifying donor types, our focus shifts to understanding how the way we present information influences donations, how different donor types react to changes in policy variables (such as rebate and match rates) and how income shifts affect donations."
