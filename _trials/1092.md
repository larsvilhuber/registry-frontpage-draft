abstract: "People's beliefs about immigration have been shown to be very biased, which could help explain why most people in the United States and in Europe want to dramatically reduce immigration. It is therefore important to understand whether people would change their attitude towards immigrants if they received accurate information about immigration and the characteristics of immigrants. The experiment we want to conduct consists in providing facts and statistics about immigration to half of the participants, before measuring their attitude towards immigrants with some behavioural measures and some general questions about immigration. We will also run a follow-up experiment to see whether the effects persist over time."
