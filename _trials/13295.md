abstract: "This project aim to explore why policies promoting gender equality remain underrepresented in conservative countries. We explore these issues in Turkey, a country that ranks 124th in gender equality measurements, 134th in female economic participation and opportunity, and 112th in women's political empowerment according to the World Economic Forumâ€™s Global Gender Gap Report 2022. We aim to use experimental variation to evaluate voter response to campaign promises on ``gender issues'' compared to voters in a control group who are not exposed to any campaign. To disentangle party or canvasser persuasion effects (supply) on voter behavior from campaign content (demand), we estimate the differential effect of the gender-related campaign to a placebo, a second campaign treatment arm on ``general issues.'' We plan to study the impact of our campaigns on voting behavior during elections. This protocol describes our experimental design prior to the 2024 election and complements our companion protocol (AEARCTR-0011469) which describes our experimental design prior to the 2023 election.
