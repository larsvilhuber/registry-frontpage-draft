abstract: "Throughout our lives, we are routinely offered different incentives as a way to motivate us. Many researchers have studied the effects of incentives on peopleâ€™s performance. There can also be important psychological outcomes in terms of stress and happiness. The current project contributes to the literature by explicitly accounting for this performance-versus-well-being trade-off introduced by incentives. In total four different incentives and their interactions were provided to students. Such cross-cutting design allows me to study the complementarities of the incentives. Additional outcome of tee project is to study the role of feedback in shaping subjects' expectations. Finally, having friendship network structure of each student within his/her class allows me to study how various competitive environments influence group formations in classes at different school levels.
