abstract: "This study comprises an RCT to evaluate the impact of information (returns to education and probabilities of graduation) on students attending the last year of high school (5th year/senior). Even though the analysis of school attainment is not novel in the economic literature, I analyze this topic in a context with free education, free transportation, and high attendance but low completion rates (50% of the students attending the last year graduate by the end of the academic year). The structure of the educational system, that allows postponing the attendance to examination periods for pending subjects (up to 2, from previous years), will allow me to study potential mechanisms. This research is important to determine which piece of information could be more relevant to increase probabilities of graduation in a vulnerable population for whom career paths are going to be determined in the short run, and having a high school diploma will condition most of their choices (attending college or finding a job in the formal sector)."
