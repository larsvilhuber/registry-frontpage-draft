abstract: "The aim of the study is to examine how cognitive uncertainty is moderated by cognitive ability in preference elicitation research. Moreover, it is examined whether subjects under higher cognitive uncertainty are more likely to accept to have their choice be replaced with a bid that maximizes subjects' expected payoff and whether replacing their choice varies with increasing cost levels.
