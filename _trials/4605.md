abstract: "We ask whether poor rural households benefit from better access to mobile money agents. In a randomized experiment, we assigned 168 areas in Northern Uganda to receive an agent in 2017, with 163 areas serving as a control group. Data from a 2018 household survey show that the agent rollout doubled the nonfarm self-employment rate, from 3.4 to 6.4 percent, and reduced the fraction of households with very low food security from 62.9 to 47.2 percent, in more remote areas. These increases appear to be due to more peer-to-peer transfers and cost savings for remittance transactions."
