abstract: "Agricultural productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa remains low despite the huge potential economic and food security importance of agriculture. In Nigeria, two important staple crops are maize and cowpea, but they persistently have low productivity: maize yield is at 1.62 ton per hectare compared to 4.2 ton per hectare in Ethiopia and about 5-6 ton per hectare on average in Southern Africa and globally. Based on LSMS 2018, only 11% of maize farming grew improved maize varieties and 7% used certified seeds. Only 3% of cowpea farmers grew improved cowpea varieties and only 2% used certified seeds. An experimental study via a randomized controlled trial is underway to verify these adoption rates, understand why adoption is very low, and test interventions to help increase adoption and improve farmersâ€™ productivity and incomes. 

The interventions focus on maize and cowpea producers (who are also maize and cowpea consumers).  The interventions are targeted to address production-side constraints (through seed trial minipacks and training on good agriculture practices) and consumption-side constraints (through grain/flour minipacks and village-level cooking/tasting demonstrations). 

The study setting is northern Nigeria, specifically Kaduna and Bauchi states."
