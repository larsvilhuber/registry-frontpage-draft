abstract: "There is huge interest in the Social Sciences to understand what determines peopleâ€™s attitudes towards immigrants. One question that has received a lot of popular and scholarly attention is what can be done to address extremely negative sentiment as well as overly negative beliefs. A popular theory to understand these questions has been contact theory, which claims that the more people interact with others of different social identities the less negative or biased their attitudes will become. A huge literature in the Social Sciences and Psychology testing contact theory empirically focuses on shifts in mean attitudes. In this paper we propose an alternative mechanism. Contact reduces uncertainty by increasing the sample based on which people make inference about relevant characteristics of social groups. The experiment pre-registered here is designed to answer two key questions in this context: Do people pay attention to uncertainty when choosing who to interact with? Do people perceive more uncertainty when interacting with foreign nationals? "
