abstract: "The Fair Housing Act, through Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), “prohibits discrimination in housing because of: race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, [and] disability.” This list notably excludes gender identity, to the extent that such identity is not inherent to “sex.” Using a well-worn correspondence methodology with a novel treatment, this study aims to identify how market behavior is affected by (a) the decision to disclose one's gender identity, and (b) whether the disclosed gender identity matches the individual's biological (chromosomal) sex."
