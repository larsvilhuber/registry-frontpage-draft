abstract: "Despite significant progress in India's financial services landscape, women, especially in rural areas, face differential challenges in meaningfully using these services. In this project, we propose to experimentally evaluate the impact of introducing last-mile female banking agents (or bank sakhis) in rural Bihar (India). We propose to study whether bank sakhis can increase financial usage and integration in the formal banking system (particularly for women), the extent to which sakhis can also play a role in providing non-transactional financial support to women, and whether this can ultimately challenge views on womenâ€™s limited roles in the economy. Lastly, we propose to use descriptive evidence, along with additional survey and administrative data to disentangle three channels that are implicitly embedded in the intervention, namely: (i) the gender identity of the agent; (ii) an increase in competition among agents due to the introduction of the bank sakhi; (iii) the specific bank that was assigned to partner with sakhis in our study area."
