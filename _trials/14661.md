abstract: "Advancements in technology are transforming data collection methods in experimental economics, enabling more sophisticated insights into human behavior. Tools capable of monitoring and reporting subjects' emotions during experiments provide a richer understanding of economic decision-making and the psychological mechanisms driving it. This marks a significant improvement over traditional approaches that relied solely on self-reported emotional evaluations, which are prone to biases and inaccuracies. By integrating self-reported evaluations with emotion-tracking technologies, researchers can achieve a more precise estimation of subjects' emotions. Understanding the differences between these two methods is crucial for developing accurate measures that enhance the reliability and depth of analysis in experimental economics."
