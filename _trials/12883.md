abstract: "While international migration typically accompanies the development process, resulting in net gains for both sending and receiving countries especially in the medium- to long-term, a sudden and large-scale immigration of high-skilled workers can result in critical shortages of qualified workers in key sectors of economic activity in the sending country. When emigration is undertaken under duress, induced by economic and/ or political instability, such detrimental effects may be more pronounced. When migration is motivated by a need to escape duress at home, prospective emigrants may be willing to accept lower wages  to move abroad, than under more normal circumstances. They may also be more willing to take up work that they are overqualified for. Both such choices represent a potential misallocation of labour, provoked by the difficult circumstances faced by potential emigrants at home. Our study seeks to understand the extent to which (i) political instability (resulting in civil conflict) and (ii) economic uncertainty drive the willingness of high-skilled youth in Myanmar to migrate aborad, the threshold wage differential at which they become indifferent between migrating and remaining at home, and the extent to which they may be amendable to undertake work for which they are overqualified. We examine these questions in the context of the military takeover of government in Myanmar since 2021, followed by high levels of violent conflict and economic collapse. As young people in Myanmar face diminished economic prospects, the appeal of emigrating abroad may increase, the reservation wage for work abroad may fall, and the hesitation to perform work they are overqualified for may reduce. Does the willingness of high-skilled youth to emigrate respond more to political or to economic prospects and expectations? We examine these questions through the use of a randomized questionnaire module in which respondents will be randomly assigned one of three hypothetical scenarios representing (i) an improvement in the political situation including the cessation of violent conflict, (ii) an improvement in the economic situation including currency and price stabilization, and (iii) a neutral scenario representing things as they are at present. Under each of these scenarios we estimate (i) the wage premium/ discount that would make high skilled youth indifferent between migrating and staying on in Myanmar, (ii) a similar wage premium/ discount but for taking on less skilled work abroad. In a second, linked survey experiment, we will also attempt to understand what level of wage premium/ discount would make Myanmar nationals living abroad indifferent between returning to Myanmar and staying on in their countries of residence under randomly assigned scenarios of political and economic improvements in Myanmar.
