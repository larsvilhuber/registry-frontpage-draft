abstract: "The Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) study investigates whether a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program designed set in a developing country without violence-reduction specifically in mind can still effectively decrease the prevalence of intimate partner violence. The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate whether CBT impacts different types of IPV outcomes and, if so, whether the effects differ depending on if the recipient of the CBT treatment is male or female. A secondary purpose of the study is to evaluate whether CBT has any spillover effects on IPV outcomes within households that lived in treatment communities but did not themselves receive CBT."
