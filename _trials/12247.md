abstract: "Prior studies suggest that when acting as spectators people attach normative significance to a decision-maker making a choice, even when every choice in the set of alternatives available to the decision-maker generates identical probabilistic outcomes. Our study is designed to understand the potential factors that drive this finding and examine its robustness. "
