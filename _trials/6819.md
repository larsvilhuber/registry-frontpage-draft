abstract: "We conduct an information provision experiment to investigate the relevance of statistical information for economic attitudes towards immigration. Our experimental design is embedded into a large-scale representative online survey. We randomize the provision of information on the share and the unemployment rate of foreigners, representing facts about immigration related to the size and economic characteristics of the immigrant population, respectively. We aim to analyze the effect of information provision on two prominent economic channels of immigration attitudes: welfare state and labor market concerns about immigration. In addition, we examine whether biases in beliefs about immigration translate into immigration policy preferences and preferences for redistribution in host societies."
