abstract: "We propose a lab-experiment to study the role of affirmative action and taxation on the competitiveness of individuals. In this experiment we will exogenously introduce variation in the productivity of subjects. Subjects will perform a routine task under various compensation schemes including piece rate, tournament conditions, tournament conditions with affirmative action and tournament conditions with redistributive taxation. After having gained experience under these schemes, subject will be asked to choose between a given pair of schemes. We are interested in the choice in these binary decisions and in the productivity of subjects across schemes as well as how these choices depend on individual attributes. "
