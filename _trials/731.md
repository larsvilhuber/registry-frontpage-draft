abstract: "This study makes use of the data on the response of output to various behavioral conditions in a real-effort experiment, which was gathered as a part of the project registered as "Response of Output to Varying Incentive Structures on Amazon Turk" (AEARCTR-0000714). The behavioral treatments include examinations of the response to incentives, altruistic motives, loss aversion, and gift exchange, among others. A group of forecasters, including experts in economics, psychology, and decision-making, will be asked to predict the output resulting from each of the conditions.  We then compare these forecasts to the actual results to examine the relevance of expertise to forecasting experimental results. "
