abstract: "Affect labeling, the process of putting feelings into words, has been shown in neuroscientific studies to have a calming effect on the brain and to reduce anxiety. This study examines the impact of affect labeling on self-reported levels of anxiety. We conducted an online experiment with three hundred participants from the United States, who were randomly assigned to either a control group or a treatment group. Both groups were exposed to news about a violent crime and then asked to report their level of anxiety. The treatment group also had the opportunity to express their feelings in an unrestricted way before reporting their anxiety level. Our results show that affect labeling has a significant negative effect on self-reported anxiety levels, suggesting that it can be an effective tool for reducing anxiety generated by negative news."
