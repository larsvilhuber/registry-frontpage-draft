abstract: "This study examines interventions to improve the delivery and targeting of welfare programs for construction workers in Odisha, India. Construction workers are a vulnerable population exposed to a high degree of physical and expropriation risk, and the state has designed a range of welfare programs intended specifically for them. Despite high awareness, enrollment is constrained by transaction costs and information barriers. Using a cluster-randomized design, we will compare two approaches: (1) reducing transaction costs via government-led onsite registration and (2) addressing information asymmetries through clear, actionable enrollment guidance. We will test treatment effects on a range of outcomes, including labor card enrollment, benefit access, costs of application, labor supply, and earnings. The study contributes to key questions in the public economics and development economics literatures by evaluating cost-effective mechanisms to improve program uptake and reduce exclusion errors in the implementation of welfare programs targeted at vulnerable populations."
