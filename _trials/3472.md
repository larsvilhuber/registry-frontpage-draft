abstract: "In the weeks after the 2016 presidential elections, support for left-leaning charitable organizations skyrocketed: In the first six weeks Planned Parenthood received donations at 40 times the normal rate, and by the six-month mark ACLU membership had more than quadrupled. Was this a one-time response to a uniquely controversial election, or is this suggestive of typical patterns of support for politically-bent charities? I aim to address this question by first conducting an observational data analysis to explore whether individuals are more generally inclined to give more to left-or right-leaning causes after the party with which they are ideologically affiliated loses power. I also seek to explore the possible mechanisms underlying such a trend, including (1) the emotional desire for retribution; (2) the increased salience of given causes around an election; or (3) a ‘crowd in’ effect where private donations increase when government support decreases. I plan to run an Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) experiment around the midterm elections in order to both provide individual-level evidence for the more general trend of increased giving following political losses and also to specifically isolate the ‘retribution’ mechanism."
