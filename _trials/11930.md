abstract: "Women are significantly less willing to enter tournaments than men. However, the conditions under which such gender differences persist remain an open and ongoing question. This paper extends the existing literature by examining the gender gap in competitiveness facing a stated-effort task rather than a real-effort task. The objective is to test the gender gap in entry decisions in an induced-value environment where heterogeneous beliefs about relative abilities can be held constant across subjects. I develop an entry experiment with complete information common value all-pay auction corresponding to the winner-take-all real-effort tournament environment. In this auction, the subject with the highest effort wins and receives the prize but all efforts are sunk. Using all-pay auction theory, I develop equilibrium predictions on the effect of competitiveness and risk aversion on entry and bidding decisions. Empirically, I control for the effects of risk aversion with a unique set of within-subject lottery treatments in which subjects face a randomizing computer opponent rather than a human opponent. "
