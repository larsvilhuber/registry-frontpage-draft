abstract: "This study analyzes experimental data from a carefully designed seating arrangement in elementary schools in China to estimate the effects of a complete mixed-seating classroom and incentivized study help. We randomly set up two-thirds of classes as complete mixed-seating classrooms in which low- and high-ability students are divided into two tracks according to the median score of a previous examination. Students in the lower and upper tracks are randomly paired as deskmates and sat together for 20 weeks. A tournament-type incentive based on the improved score of lower-track students is set among upper-track students in half of the mixed-seating classes. We find that lower-track students assigned with incentivized upper-track students gained 0.24 standard deviations in their mathematics scores. In comparison, students in the complete mixed-seating classroom without incentives showed minimal change in their scores. We provide evidence that the positive treatment effect can be attributed to the deskmate-level peer effects, which are shown to be associated with network structure changes: the incentivized complete mixed-seating classes promote social ties between deskmates and separate links among lower-track students."
