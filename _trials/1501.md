abstract: "We propose a large-scale field experiment to study the effect of a public-private partnership (PPP) in Liberia. The Partnership Schools for Liberia (PSL) program will delegate management of 92 randomly assigned public schools to be operated free of charge to students by a variety of private organizations, both for-profit and non-profit. By comparing these PSL schools to regular government schools in the control group, we will test whether private management improves school management and teacher accountability as measured by absenteeism, time on task, and ultimately student performance. Complementary analysis will assess the sustainability, scalability, and relative cost-effectiveness of this PPP model, as well as its effects on equity through student composition and spillovers.
