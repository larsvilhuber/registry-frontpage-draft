abstract: "Time inconsistency – when we fail to follow our own plans – can be explained through a dual-self model where a farsighted ‘planner’ is overruled by a myopic ‘doer’ (Thaler and Shefrin, 1981). This lens is applied to weight loss and obesity. One solution is to bind our future choices to ensure we stay on the right path, using some commitment device. This field experiment tests whether a simple commitment contract to oneself can work in the context of a public weight loss programme to help obese and overweight individuals meet their goals. It further examines heterogeneity pathways and whether the commitment contract works better for some individuals more than others, and if so what this might imply for targeting commitment devices in public health programmes."
