abstract: "Requirements in combination with punitive sanctions are commonly used to incentivize unemployed workers to search for and accept jobs, but incomplete information may limit their effectiveness. In a large-scale field experiment, we investigate how relaxing informational constraints regarding a requirement to work a minimum number of hours affects labor market outcomes of welfare benefit recipients in Denmark. The experimental design allows us to disentangle the effect of providing (i) general information about existing work requirements for welfare recipients, and (ii) personalized information about the benefit recipients personal risk of falling short of target. This allows us to  investigate how individuals' awareness of the requirement affects and uncertainty about the risk of being sanctioned affects the labor market of unemployed workers.
