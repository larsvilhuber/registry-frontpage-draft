abstract: " This project aims to better understand under which conditions people use social information to learn and imitate others. In many situations, people can either follow their own signals or follow a social signal. Depending on the quality of the signals one might be more informative than the other. We are interested in what happens if both the private and the social signals become less informative. In the real world, this can be the case in situations where information is ambiguous. This paper investigates whether people in such situations are more likely to follow the social signal. To answer this question we conduct an experimental study that observes whether people are prone to imitate in a risky or in an ambiguous environment."
