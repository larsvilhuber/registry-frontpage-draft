abstract: "In this paper, we investigate whether online exposure to social movements campaigning against income and gender inequality affects preferences for redistribution and political behavior. We conducted a large representative online experiment randomizing participants into three groups: two treatments and a control group. The first treatment group was asked to follow a Facebook page created by the authors and re-posting content on income inequality from the pages of social movements. The second treatment group was asked to complete a similar task to one of the first treatment group, but with a Facebook page re-posting content on income and gender inequality. Our results show that exposure to social movements` campaigns against inequalities shapes preferences for redistribution by raising the consensus that government intervention should be directed toward reducing inequalities. Individuals exposed to information on income inequality would allocate significantly more resources toward fighting income inequality, while those exposed to information on gender inequality would allocate significantly more resources to fighting gender inequality. We also show that exposure to social movements increases democratic participation by appealing to the government for political reforms.  "
