abstract: "The problem of low productivity of instruction in government schools in India (“the learning crisis”) is well documented. This study focuses on the increased use of technology in education, which is frequently proposed for improving this low productivity, but where the evidence base for the effectiveness of such policies remains mixed. We are evaluating the impact of a technology-led intervention (Mindspark), developed by Education Initiatives (EI) which provides personalized instruction to students in grades 1-8 which is individually customized to their level of achievement on student learning. We use a randomized control trial method to evaluate the impact of the program on classroom processes and student learning in Adarsh (consolidated) schools in four districts of Rajasthan over three academic years. This trial builds on promising results reported in Muralidharan, Singh and Ganimian (2019) in out-of-school settings in Delhi. The primary outcomes for this study will be student achievement, which will be measured directly using independently-designed student assessments in language and mathematics. In addition, we will be collecting data on program usage from the software as well as information on program implementation through direct observations and interviews with students and teachers.  "
