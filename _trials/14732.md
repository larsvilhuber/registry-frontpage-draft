abstract: "While joint-liability and group lending has long been at the core of microfinance, recent evidence
suggests that these terms have not fulfilled their promise of reducing loan defaults and operational
costs. Since borrowers commonly face symmetric contract terms, group members are subject to
coordination and free-riding problems. Peers might enforce each other to repay their loans, but might
also free-ride or jointly default. We propose that asymmetric joint-liability microfinance loans are a
suitable instrument to increase repayment rates and decrease loan defaults of microfinance clients. In
such asymmetric contracts, one borrower will become an optimally incentivized lead-borrower
(group-leader) through asymmetric interest rates, which is expected to increase monitoring efforts and
thereby reduce moral hazard of all group members. We rely on the theoretical model of Carli & Uras
(2017) for a lending scenario with ex-ante moral hazard and develop a new theoretical model for a
lending scenario of ex-post moral hazard. We then empirically test both models through a lab-in-the-
field experiments with Bolivian microfinance clients."
