abstract: "The current projects seeks to experimentally analyse robo advising and trading. To this end we will first elicit risk preferences and financial literacy of subjects. In a next step subjects will be given the opportunity to participate in experimental financial markets. In some of these markets, they will have the opportunity to receive financial advice on optimal portfolio choice from an algorithm, which is programmed to match risk preferences, and in other markets may delegate their decisions to such an algorithm."
