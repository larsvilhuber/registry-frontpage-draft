abstract: "In recent years, most of the major violent conflicts in the world have happened in Muslim-majority countries. Of these conflicts, a substantial and increasing share is related to Islamist insurgents. However, the process of radicalization and the effectiveness of measures to counteract it are widely understudied. We study how a radio campaign and targeted voice messages can help prevent conflict. The interventions are part of a radio campaign sponsored by local religious organizations that want to detach religion (namely Islam) from the mobilization of young men for violent attacks. Contents are sponsored by the Islamic Council and the Islamic Congress of Mozambique, the main organizations representing Muslims in the country, as well as the Catholic and Christian councils. Our setting is Northern Mozambique, where a substantial discovery of natural gas took place in recent years. Beginning in 2017, a series of violent attacks, mainly targeting civilians, has been happening in this region, resulting in more than 1000 casualties and 200,000 displaced to date. There are many accounts of the mobilization of youths to join these attacks based on radicalized Islamic beliefs, although there is no record, in recent history, of contentious religious divisions in Mozambique. This provides a unique setting in which sources of radicalization can be studied.   "
