abstract: "We implement a behavioral intervention intended to promote the take-up and maintenance of a mindfulness meditation habit. Over a period of 36 days, participants can complete daily online meditation sessions and receive monetary incentives to do so.
We compare a control group (where subjects receive access to the meditation sessions but no monetary incentives to complete them) to two incentive treatments where subjects receive monetary compensations. In one treatment, subjects are assigned one of two reward schemes: the first is based on a constant payment for each completed session; the second rewards subjects (comparatively more) for completing sessions in 3-days streaks. The second incentive treatment is identical to the first, except subjects are allowed to choose the scheme that they prefer between the two described above.
We explore the following questions: (1) Can mindfulness meditation habits be created and sustained by behavioral interventions similarly to other more commonly studied habits (such as gym attendance)?; (2) How does the dynamic incentive scheme compare to the constant incentive scheme?; (3) Does letting participants choose their own incentives increase engagement and completion rates?
