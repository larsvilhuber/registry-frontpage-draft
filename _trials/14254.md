abstract: "We consider a Lazear-Rosen tournament model involving a tournament administrator (employer or principal) and two agents competing for the prize (the promotion), and test experimentally the principal's inferences and the agents' responses. Specifically, one agent has an exogenous advantage, which is known and observable to the principal. The principal's incentives are designed such that it's in their best interest to design a promotion rule that levels the playing field ex post. We will test whether i) the principals promote optimally and if not, ii) agents anticipate this distortion and adapt effort accordingly. "
