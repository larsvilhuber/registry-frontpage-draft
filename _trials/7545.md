abstract: "In this project we run a longitudinal field experiment in order to decompose the mechanisms that drive the influence recommendation systems have on consumption choices in terms of their informational and product discovery value.

Targeting a class of goods for which recommendations are ubiquitous -- movies --, we randomize the set of recommended movies on a movie-recommendation platform and compare outcomes to a control group of movies that holds fixed individuals' idiosyncratic preferences.
We test for whether recommendations meaningfully affect consumption patterns and beliefs about products.
