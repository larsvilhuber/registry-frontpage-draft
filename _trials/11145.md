abstract: "There is a lack of evidence for how heterogeneous beliefs of the population may affect the effectiveness and efficiency of incentivized subsidy programs. This project seeks to expand our knowledge of smallholder farmers' beliefs and actions towards climate change by examining how adaptation strategies respond to conditional cash transfers and information drops. We study this in the context of cocoa production in Ghana, where shade level management, i.e. growing forest trees on cocoa farms, is considered an adaptive farming practice to combat climate change. With a lab-in-the-field game design, we implement three subsidy interventions to examine cocoa farmers' different adaptation decisions on shade level. Apart from the standard payment for ecosystem services (PES), providing a fixed payment directly if the quantity of input (ecosystem services) passes a threshold, we consider two alternatives: (1) variable PES, which provides variable payments according to the input levels; (3) market-based variable PES, which offers an output-based price premium that increases with the level of ecosystem services. The cost-effectiveness of these three incentivized subsidies is ambiguous given the different distributions of heterogeneous beliefs.  Additionally, we interact the two variable PES treatments with an information intervention to explore the role of correcting beliefs and its impacts on the effectiveness of the two subsidies, where farmers are informed of both climate change risks and benefits of the climate-change-resilient shade-grown practice. This draft was completed and registered after baseline data collection, but prior to the analysis of any follow-up data."
