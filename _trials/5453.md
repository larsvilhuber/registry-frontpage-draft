abstract: "The Escaping Poverty (EP) project was developed in response to two major challenges facing developing nations: low incomes and poor mental health. The two issues are undoubtedly linked, yet programs to increase earnings or reduce depression often operate in separate siloes. The EP study aims to bridge this gap. EP randomized whether or not households received cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) prior to receiving a multi-faceted economic program (often referred to as a “graduation” model), to see the extent to which improving an individual’s mental health better enables them to take advantage of an economic opportunity. Moreover, by randomizing which components of the graduation program participants receive, the study seeks to investigate which aspects are most crucial to its success."
