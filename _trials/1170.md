abstract: "This study analyzes how financial and career incentive schemes affect labor productivity differently through worker selection and incentive channels. It is difficult to establish a causal relationship between work incentives and worker productivity because of the self-selection based on job seekersâ€™ ability, expectation, personality, etc. We overcome this challenge through a two-stage randomized controlled trial in which our collaborating NGO recruits male enumerators for a population census of a rural district in Malawi. We make an important contribution to the literature by analyzing what types of workers internships attract (selection effect) and how they incentivize workers to improve their job performance (incentive effect)."
