abstract: "I use a real-stakes experiment in an online labor market to directly test if consumers incorporate credit costs into their purchasing decisions. In the experiment, participants are provided a monthly income stream that can be used to make purchases from a menu of goods. This income stream intentionally forces liquidity constraints on participants, as it is insufficient for making any immediate purchases. Some participants are also offered the option to use credit plans to acquire goods immediately rather than waiting until enough income has been saved up for a purchase. The credit plans offered vary between participants by price and price-quoting method. "
