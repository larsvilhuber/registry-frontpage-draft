abstract: "Low socioeconomic status (SES) students aspire to lower educational and professional pathways than their high-SES peers, even when they have equal test scores . While lower aspirations could be the outcome of a rational decision due to greater external constraints and adverse living circumstances, recent evidence has pointed out that on top of these constraints, people living in disadvantaged situations are far more likely to face internal constraints  (behavioral bias) that influence their decision-making process. The study seeks to analyze the impact of an intervention rooted in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy on students' goals, schooling, and wellbeing outcomes.
