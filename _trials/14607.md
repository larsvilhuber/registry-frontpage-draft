abstract: "Low-income individuals often face barriers in accessing productive capital that could enhance their economic potential. When access to such capital increases worker productivity, the lack of it can reduce both worker productivity and firm revenues. In collaboration with a large service-providing firm, we aim to reduce credit market barriers that hinder worker investment in productive capital.

The treatment includes a bundled intervention: (i) a randomized 10% discount on the price of capital, which can be applied towards the lender's deposit requirement, and (ii) a connection to a lender. Subsequent experiments will separately randomize access to each component to isolate their individual effects and explore any complementarity between them. Additionally, we plan to conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment to estimate whether the firm's involvement increases the lender's probability of lending to this population and whether firm facilitation is ultimately profitable for the firm."
