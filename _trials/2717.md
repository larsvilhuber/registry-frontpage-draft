abstract: "Girl Empower is an innovative program designed by the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and generously supported by the NoVo Foundation, to equip girls with the skills and experiences necessary to make healthy, strategic life choices and to stay safe from sexual exploitation and abuse. The program responds not only to girls’ heightened exposure to harm in humanitarian and post-conflict settings, but also to the vital roles they can play in building healthier families and stronger communities.

Unique in its strategy because it addresses multiple aspects of girls’ lives, Girl Empower ensures that the whole girl is supported and focuses interventions on building the assets of adolescent girls.  Primary program components include:

•	A comprehensive life skills curriculum implemented by mentors made up of young women from the local communities
•	A safe space for the girls to meet with their mentors as a group and individually
•	A parent/caregiver discussion group that will complement the learning and asset building of the girls
•	The creation of individual savings accounts for the girls with an initial deposit made through the program
•	Capacity building and training of local health and psychosocial service providers to provide quality services to survivors of gender-based violence 

A cluster-randomized controlled trial has been designed to test the effectiveness of this approach in improving the welfare of young females in Liberia as described elsewhere in this registration."
