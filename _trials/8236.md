abstract: "The Good Exporting Practices (GEP) program is an innovative initiative of the Ghana Export Promotion Authority (GEPA), the African Center for Economic Transformation (ACET), HES-SO Geneva School of Business Administration (HES), and the Interdisciplinary Institute of Political Economy (IIEP) of the University of Buenos Aires (Argentina), with funding support from the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF). The lack of knowledge about the importance of adopting good exporting practices severely hinders firmsâ€™ possibilities for success in export markets. As a result, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) producers of differentiated goods from developing countries often sell their products in foreign markets as if they were commodities and fail in the attempt. To address this limitation, we conduct a capability-building consultancy program to help Ghanaian firms upgrade their export and employment performance through the adoption of good exporting practices. The main outcomes of interest are the degree of adoption of export practices, export performance, and employment. The population of interest is Ghanaian SMEs between 3 and 250 employees producing differentiated goods from the non-traditional export sector. 

Our sample size (baseline) is 180 firms. Firms will be randomly assigned to one treatment group and the control group. The randomization will be conducted after the baseline survey is completed and before the intervention starts."
