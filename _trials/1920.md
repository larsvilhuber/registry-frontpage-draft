abstract: "One of the most famous and often replicated findings from psychology and behavioral economics is the anchoring effect. People believed to be using an 'anchor and adjust' heuristic are prone to be influenced by a random numerical cue when trying to make an estimate of some entity (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974, Ariely et al., 2003, Furnham and Boo, 2011). The anchoring effect could be of economic significance for example if consumers are influenced by price cues (like when companies show the previous price they discounted from in many adverts). Another example could be bargaining situations where one of the parties comes with quite an extreme opening proposal in order to possibly anchor another party into shifting their idea about what is a 'reasonable' outcome. 

What both these two examples have in common however is that they reason from situations where the s anchor is itself set by an interested and strategic party. This, whereass the anchoring effect has mostly been demonstrated in situations where the anchor was clearly a random number, thus originating from a nonstrategic source. There has been an early study into the effect of the size of opening bids on the subsequent outcome of a negotiation (Galinsky and Mussweiler, 2001). The researchers found an anchoring effect and their interpretation  was indeed that there could be an a 'strategic anchoring' effect at work here. However attributing an opening bid effect to the anchoring and adjust heuristic is not straightforward here. There are a number of diferent channels through which opening bids could affect a negotiation outcome. Firsly high opening bid could signal to the negotiation partner that you are a 'tough' bargainer,  clearly not afraid to make a 'bold' demand and risk a non-agreement outcome. Secondly, stating a high opening bid could create a 'mental' commitment for the party making the opening bid. Now that the high 'share of the cake'ambition is spoken out, it would feel like a loss to concede too much compared to this first demand, making the party again more likely to opt out from a deal that would be too far away from the opening bid. Thirdly a high opening bid could indeed act like an anchor to the other barainingparty.

We propose here to circumvent these issues and run a bargaining experiment where we can isolate the effect of the type of source of an anchor on the size of the anchoring effect. Our experiment will provide a number of insigths. We will shed light on wether a psychological effect as the anchoring effect works in a strategic setting such as a negotation. And we tackle the question of wether people are differently affected by anchors coming from a neutral, random source, or is set by a strategic and interested source."
