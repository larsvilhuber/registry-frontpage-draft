abstract: "In spite of the emergence of minimum income schemes in some high-income countries, such as the Ingreso Mínimo Vital (IMV) in Spain, there is not enough evidence to proof that these transfers alone can promote social inclusion amongst potential beneficiaries. In these contexts, it is common to find non-governmental organizations (NGOs) providing packages of several social services for low-income households, including programs around educational, labor, and social support, which aim to enhance the effectiveness of underlying government income schemes. We are currently partnering with Save the Children-Spain (STC) and the Spanish Ministry of Inclusion, Social Security and Migrations (MISSM) to run a randomized evaluation of STC’s labor, education, and social interventions targeting families with school-age  children that are socially excluded or at risk of social exclusion . Families will be randomly assigned to receive either the standard STC ‘social support’ package, or to receive ‘social support’ plus a combination of labor and educational support interventions. Our primary outcomes will include measures of subjective wellbeing and income, parents’ labor insertion, and educational achievement and attitudes amongst their children. At the end of the experiment, we expect to proof that a comprehensive social program that incorporates labor and educational components can be more effective on improving the well-being of children and adolescents of vulnerable families than other programs that only provide social support.
