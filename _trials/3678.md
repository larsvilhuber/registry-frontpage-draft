abstract: "Goal 5 of the sustainable development goals adopted by the United Nations in 2015 aims to eliminate all forms of discrimination and violence against women in public and private spheres and to undertake reforms to give women equal rights to economic resources and access to ownership of property. Government of India has identified ending violence against women as a key national priority too. Brutal gangrape of a 23-year-old woman in 2012 in the capital of India led to an outcry against public apathy towards endemic sexual assault and harassment against women.  

Pervasive sexual harassment can have debilitating impacts on psychological, economic and social lives of the harassed.Tackling sexual harassment is difficult when there is a lack of reporting by survivors which can perpetuate harassment. Stigma attached to survivors of sexual harassment or assault reduces the likelihood that it gets reported to the police.  This creates a lack of knowledge on prevalence of harassment. Lack of information on sexual harassment  can create public apathy towards it. 
This project aims to undertake interventions to understand what is the role of lack of information about different aspects of the issue (incidence, intensity) and whether sensitization about sexual harassment can help create awareness, empathy for the issue along with its impact on relationships with peers.
