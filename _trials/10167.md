abstract: "The goal of this research project is to determine whether anomalies arising in well-known binary choices between lotteries also arise in binary choices between equations describing the expected values of the same lotteries. For the set of choices, we focus on scaled versions of all relevant choices reported in “Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk” (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979)."
