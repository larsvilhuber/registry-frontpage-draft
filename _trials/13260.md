abstract: "We evaluate the impact of a new individual liability credit product on microfinance borrowers in Chile. This new credit product is significantly larger than the standard loan offered to borrowers, making it particularly suitable for fixed asset investment. We focus on measuring the impacts on business outcomes, such as profits, assets and household income, as well as any spillover effects to the local economy. In addition, we evaluate the extent to which loan officers and other peersâ€™ opinions on the suitability of borrowers for the new product predict whether they are indeed good candidates for the loan."
