abstract: "This study is based on the theory of nudging to design peak electricity-saving intervention messages. Different messages are sent to diﬀerent experimental groups of users at a specific frequency in the name of the State Grid Corporation of China, aiming to reduce the load pressure on the power grid during peak periods and ensure the normal supply of electricity. We aim to measure the eﬀectiveness of interventions on peak-hour electricity usage,  and their spillover eﬀects over time. We will also examine how the impact of nudging is affected by the temperature on the day of the nudging. The study will provide recommendations for power companies and residents on peak electricity-saving measures."
