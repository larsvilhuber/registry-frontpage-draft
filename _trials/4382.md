abstract: "There is a growing interest in understanding the future of work. Given recent advancements in artificial intelligence and machine-learning technology, there are increasing concerns that many of today’s jobs will become automated and performed by machines. Much of the research on the future of work has been grounded in a task-based approach introduced in economics, which focuses on tasks’ technical suitability for automation. While the task-based approach represents an important first step, organizations are key drivers of technological change, and we must understand the role they will play in the future of work. In this paper, we propose one way to think about organizations in this debate. Our approach, grounded in the knowledge-based theory of firm, posits that we can theorize of automation as the transfer of knowledge from an individual to a machine. Such transfer is more difficult when knowledge is tacit, so automation will be more difficult to implement for teams whose coordination is based on organizational routines rather than explicit mechanisms. We test these predictions in a coordination game based in the lab."
