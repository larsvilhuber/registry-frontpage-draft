abstract: "The study entails an experiment in entire, isolated Argentinian communities in the province of Tucuman. By exogenously changing the beliefs of individuals within these communities, we aim at bringing experimental evidence on the evolution of wisdom of the crowd (community knowledge) and the aggregation of beliefs when individuals are presented with scientific evidence. The experiment will be conducted in the context of early childhood education and parenting practices. Understanding through which mechanisms social beliefs move from community knowledge to evidence-based knowledge is crucial for policymakers in this context as parental behavior plays a critical role in child development. Changing social beliefs towards better parenting practices has the potential to improve childrenâ€™s schooling and labor market outcomes and disrupt the perpetuation of socioeconomic inequality in the long-run.
