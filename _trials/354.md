abstract: "Researchers and advocates have spent countless resources attempting to bring unbanked people into a bank. Secular demographic and economic trends also play a role in driving determining the proportion of people in a society who are banked. This study uses a fixed effects and regression discontinuity design to estimate the effect of household income on propensity to be banked."
