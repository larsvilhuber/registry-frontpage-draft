abstract: "Empowering public through a feedback mechanism can enhance the quality of policing services. Currently, police officials prioritize political favors over efficient service delivery, often providing substandard services unless directed by politicians. This fosters a patronage system, where police officials secure political favors while politicians build political capital. To address this, we will randomly assign police stations into treatment and control groups. In treated police stations, complainants will provide feedback evaluating various aspects of police services. Public feedback results will influence bureaucrats' Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs), critical for promotions, and may lead to rewards such as certificates of appreciation or punitive measures based on performance. The study will assess the impact on key outcomes such as FIR filing rates, case resolution rates, and crime statistics, with the expectation that linking career advancement to public feedback will lead to improved policing outcomes."
