abstract: "From 2015 to 2016, close to one million refugees arrived in Germany, largely from countries with a pre-dominantly Muslim background. Muslims are the social group in Europe in general and Germany in particular that currently faces the strongest negative attitudes. We study the prevalence and dynamics of taste-based and statistical discrimination in a representative sample of the German population by using a two-wave online survey. Respondents choose between two other participants who to participate with in two-person coordination games. In addition, we elicit respondents’ behavior and beliefs with respect to the coordination games and measure relative prosocial preference with respect to the other participants in separate allocation games. Respondents know about the other participants whether they currently live in refugee shelter homes in Germany or not and see pictures of their faces. We exploit two sources of exogenous variation: (i) Pictures reveal whether headscarves are worn or not. (ii) Respondents do or do not receive information between waves—right after Wave 1 and/or right before Wave 2—on group level behavior of refugee and non-refugee participants in previous coordination games.
