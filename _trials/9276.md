abstract: "Since 2005, Pakistan has been categorized as a “water-scarce” country. In 2005, the annual water supply per capita was close to 1000 cubic meters, and by 2025 this statistic is expected to decrease to less than 500 cubic meters per capita (World Resources Institute). Eighty percent of the people in the largest 24 cities of Pakistan do not have continues access to clean water and this burden is primarily borne by the lowest income quartile. Main reasons behind this shortage include (i) substandard water infrastructure (ii) increased demand because of population growth and economic development, (iii) intensive agriculture with inefficient production practices, and (iv) climate change (changes to water cycle). Lack of water supply and inferior water quality put additional strain on several governmental proposals and policies. For example, while the recently launched Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) program aims at improving sanitation practices, water availability and quality enforces a supplementary constraint in achieving the program’s goals. 

Given these concerns, the purpose of this project is to design a series of interventions that could potentially influence individual perceptions regarding climate change and encourage taking collective action towards efficient management and maintenance of water resources at the community level, boosting water conservation efforts by households. The focus of the study will be the tribal areas in north-west Pakistan. These informational interventions aim to inform the general public on the benefits and significance of collective action in water conservation and environmental quality for individual households and communal welfare.

The experiment will be designed to provide awareness on shrinking water supplies and the importance of collective action in building and maintaining water infrastructure, such as constructing local reservoirs and repairing the current supply schemes, with an emphasis on public and private benefits. We plan to capture (1) stated preferences towards local public goods (e.g., building and maintaining reservoirs and water schemes) through demands for governmental action and political participation and (2) revealed preferences pertaining to targeted outcomes.
