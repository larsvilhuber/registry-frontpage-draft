abstract: "The Economic Inclusion Programme (EIP) is a sub-component of KSEIP which focuses on fostering the social and economic inclusion of extremely poor households by increasing their access to skills, productive inputs and assets, finance, and economic opportunities. The impact evaluation of the EIP aims to identify, quantify, and explain the causal effects of the programme on the socioeconomic conditions of beneficiaries and of the communities in which they live. The impact evaluation is being conducted in three of the five EIP intervention counties. The quantitative design comprises four separate randomised control trials (RCTs), one in Marsabit, one in Kisumu, and two in Taita Taveta."
