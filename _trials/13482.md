abstract: "Previous research found evidence that high quality math apps have the potential to increase children's math skills. This project evaluates whether sharing this research-based information with school and district leaders affects their perception about the use of educational technology for PreK and K students. We invite school and district leaders across several school districts in the US to take a one-time survey, which includes questions about the use of educational technology in their current schools/districts, and a video embedded in the survey. We randomize the participants into a treatment and a control group. The video that participants in the treatment group watch describes math apps and provides research-based evidence about their effects on childrenâ€™s learning experience and math skill. The video that participants in the control group watch only describes math apps, without providing evidence. We then compare treatment and control participants on three outcomes: (i) how likely participants are to recommend math apps, (ii) how much they would be willing to spend on math apps, and (iii) if they are interested and willing to invest more time learning about math apps."
