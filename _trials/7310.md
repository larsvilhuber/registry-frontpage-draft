abstract: "In this study, we test how relative income effects affect conformism behavior. We conduct an experiment, in which we vary relative income in form of an endowment and use a repeated voting structure between 2 policies to observe conformism behavior in groups. The repeated voting structure allows us to disentangle conformism behavior caused by different motives. The different high incomes could influence the uncertainty about the ability to make a good decision and thus affects the chance for social learning. Another treatment effect could be that the income effects induce general reciprocity and affect conformism behavior over the channel of social responsibility. Knowing when people do or do not conform, can help to implement measures to support the implementation of the majorityÂ´s vote."
