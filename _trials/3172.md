abstract: "In this project, we study the willingness of teachers to report on the absenteeism of their colleagues. Teachers in a control group are told that their reports will be used only for an academic study, and will not be forwarded to the Ministry of Education (MoE). Teachers in the "low punishment" group will be told that the reports might be forwarded to the MoE, and that this might trigger a minor punishment like a small salary reduction. Teachers in the "high punishment" group are told that the reports might be forwarded to the MoE, which has recently instituted a committee for fighting absenteeism, and that reports might trigger serious punishments like contract terminations. This allows us to study whether teachers value having absentees punished, or if instead, they want to protect their colleagues, and how this varies with the severity of punishment. We interact this three treatments with monetary incentives and evaluate how they affect the willingness to report."
