abstract: "The COVID-19 pandemic made vaccine hesitancy the focus of global attention and concern and was listed as a global health threat by the WHO in 2019. In theory, a perfectly coordinated collective action can result in disease eradication. In reality, the "wait-and-see" strategy and self-centric behaviour precluded the elimination of COVID-19. Moreover, the "infodemic" around COVID-19 resulted in a WHO's call for increased resilience against misinformation. In this project, we propose developing and testing the impact of three online games designed around vaccine literacy, empathy, and misinformation training to increase vaccination intentions. We intend to bring evidence from countries with overall high/low vaccination rates (the UK and Slovakia to start with) to address concerns about the replicability of experiments and utilise across-country heterogeneities. Gamified interventions have become popular recently, but the evidence of their effectiveness remains scarce. Therefore, our results will also contribute to the discussion about digital media's role in strengthening vaccine confidence. Later, the games can be translated into multiple languages, finetuned to fit other vaccine-preventable diseases or more specific audiences, or used in nationwide interventions. We believe our research has substantial policy implications."
