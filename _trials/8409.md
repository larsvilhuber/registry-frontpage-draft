abstract: "In order to validate the main assumptions and the functional equations of our educational planning and job search model, we investigate the effects of the method of analysis, or broadly speaking investigation inquiry-based learning (or inductive learning), on the development of cognitive skills. Our idea is that an analysis-based approach has a substantial benefit in the development of cognitive skills relative to the common synthesis-based learning process, or broadly speaking deductive learning. The trial is designed as follows: we take two primary school classes with the same teachers, one is used as a control group and the other as a treatment group. The treatment consists of an educational path, designed according to the methodologies of investigation-based science education (IBSE), that it should provide an exogenous variation in the amount of analysis done by the children. Cognitive skills are measured before and after the treatment and compared between the control and the treatment class.
 A first stage of this experiment has been conducted in Rome, Italy, last year. The RCT will continue both in the same classes of the roman primary school in which is conducted the first stage , and in another primary school in Cameroon. The educational path used as treatment are the BUL project in Italy and the TALES project in Cameroon. More details about these projects can be found here. https://it.oiler.education/scuola/materiali/primaria"
