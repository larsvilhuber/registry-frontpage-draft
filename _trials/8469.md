abstract: "I study the effect of how players in a board game generate their rolls on subjects' beliefs of certain players' winning probabilities in a board game. In particular, it is varied whether players use a tablet computer vs. whether they use a physical die and a dice shuffler to generate their die rolls. The study is implemented as an RCT laboratory experiment.
