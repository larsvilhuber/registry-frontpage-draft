abstract: "While feedback is an important part of many real-life situations, how to give feedback remains a hotly debated topic. This paper uses a field experiment to understand whether the ordering of feedback elements matters. University students get positive and negative feedback on exam practice questions, in varying order. The main outcomes are performance and motivation, further outcomes are beliefs and study behavior."
