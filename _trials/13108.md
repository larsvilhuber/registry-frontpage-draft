abstract: "We capture demand for data excludability through the willingness to pay for a real privacy commodity: data deletion from data brokers. We explore how the demand for privacy from data broker activities may differ depending on whether individuals are aware of data broker activities, the downstream consequences of commercial activity by data brokers, or from which entities brokers source individuals' data."
