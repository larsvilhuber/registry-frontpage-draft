abstract: "We are conducting a conduct a correspondence study to measure hiring discrimination against transgender job applicants for entry-level positions in the US labor market. We randomly assign gender identity and race to fictitious resumes. We measure discrimination against both transgender women and men as well as non-binary applicants relative to cisgender men and women, and we compare differences between White and Black applicants. We consider labor markets across the United States in order to examine heterogeneity in discrimination based on local political climates. "
