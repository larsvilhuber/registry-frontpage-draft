abstract: "This study experimentally explores how people's perceptions and behavioral intentions vary according to one social enterprise's sector information (i.e. being a for-profit or a non-profit) and to what extent such variation exists. Theoretically, the sector information helps people to categorize one organization and make judgments about its intentions and expected behaviors. In consequence, categorization based on the sector information will trigger organization stereotypes based on which people make judgments. In this study, two traits for judging an organization, warmth and competence, are examined. Building on previous findings of organization stereotype which suggests nonprofit organizations are warm but incompetent compared with for-profit organizations, this study instead hypothesizes that nonprofits are perceived warmer and more competent than for-profits when the organization has a social mission. In addition, the study further examines how collective judgments on the social enterprise, such as word-of-mouth, affect people's individual judgment about warmth and competence of the organization. It hypothesizes that collective judgments will moderate people's individual judgment based on organization stereotype because endorsements from others are important cognitive heuristic in a passive and effortless cognitive system which predominates people's individual evaluation which is an active and effortful process."
