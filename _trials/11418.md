abstract: "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a slow-motion pandemic. Knowledge constraints and  lack of awareness regarding the adverse health impact of antibiotics are prevalent in third-world countries. Ahmed (2019) shows that many cherry-picked drugs are ineffective in Bangladesh as an outcome of antimicrobial resistance. Village doctors (quacks) are the leading healthcare providers in rural areas who are also not aware of the adverse impact of antibiotics on the human body and are one of the primary sources of antibiotic consumption. Often, reaching out to government hospitals or registered doctors impose transportation costs, so individuals go to medicine shops to buy medicine without registered doctors' concern. Local pharmacy owners provoke customers to buy antibiotics and other unnecessary drugs, boosting their sales. People routinely purchase commonly prescribed antibiotics over the counter to facilitate a speedy recovery. Overall, knowledge constraints and lack of awareness regarding the adverse health impact of antibiotics among mass people is a huge issue in addressing the Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) problem. In this study, We will introduce an innovative information intervention to fight this problem that will potentially restrict unnecessary antibiotic take-up among mass people by targeting their medication behavior in Bangladesh."
