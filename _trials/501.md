abstract: "Poor quality plagues public service provision in many developing countries. In response, policies to enhance beneficiary involvement as a way of strengthening demand-responsiveness and local accountability are becoming increasingly popular. Despite the enthusiasm for this approach, however, the evidence provides mixed results about its short-run effectiveness. Whether it can lead to sustained improvements in service provision is largely unknown. This project studies this through two field experiments on local accountability in primary health care in Uganda. The aim is twofold. First, we provide evidence of the longer run impact of a local accountability intervention in primary health care provision in Uganda. Second, we shed light on why this particular community-based intervention resulted in such a large and sustained change in service provision while several other seemingly similar interventions have not had much of an impact. The focus here is on the role and impact of information."
