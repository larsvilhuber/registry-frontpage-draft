abstract: "As the use of mobile phones continues to spread to the most remote parts of developing economies, information and communication technologies (ICTs) are becoming an increasingly viable alternative as a timely and effective source of agricultural information. Having already conducted a randomized evaluation of mobile-phone based agricultural consulting service “Avaaj Otalo (AO)” with cotton farmers in Surendranagar, Gujarat; we saw that the demand for agricultural information is high, with more than half the farmers calling in to the AO line. We also saw changes in agricultural management practices and decreased reliance on other farmers and input dealers for agricultural information. While agricultural practices seem to have changed, the average respondent did not demonstrate improved average knowledge. Given these results, we are interested in expanding the scope of our study to roughly 3000 additional cotton farmers in Madhya Pradesh. We hope that this expansion will allow us to further explore the project’s key questions including the impact of expert agricultural advice and dynamics of knowledge propagation with deeper statistical power."
