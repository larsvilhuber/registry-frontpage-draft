abstract: "We describe the follow-up to a study previously registered and conducted in February and March of 2022. We recontact a set of participants from the original study (AEARCTR-0008950) to ask them a new set of questions, and we survey a different sample of Argentinian men to ask them some of the original questions plus the new set of questions answered by those who we re-contact.
