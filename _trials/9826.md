abstract: "Forced displacement is affecting an increasing number of people across the globe (UNHCR Global Trends 2020). War, conflict and persecution, environmental disasters or economic hardship continues to uproot people around the world and displace them from their homes. This phenomenon is also affecting children, who as a result will often experience severe stress related to their family's displacement, family conflict, difficulties with education, and social exclusion and discrimination. Such events greatly affect children’s early development and can have long lasting impacts in their cognitive and social development.

Play to Learn (PtL) Watch, Play Learn video blocks created by Sesame’s Workshop focus on developing socio-emotional learning and math skills among young children, with a focus on those affected by conflict and displacement. 

Colombia is the second largest host of internationally displaced people in the world, with more than 1.7 million Venezuelans in the country and has one of the highest numbers of internally displaced people (European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations, 2019). Access to social services for these families, including education, is limited, all of which has been exacerbated by COVID-19. Sesame Workshop along with New York University Global Ties for Children and Innovations for Poverty action will measure the impact of Watch, Play Learn video blocks targeting four-year-old children through a randomized experiment in Colombia. The sample will consist of Venezuelan migrants living in Colombia and Colombian nationals in those communities with high concentration of Venezuelan migrants.
