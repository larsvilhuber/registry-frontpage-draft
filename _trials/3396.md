abstract: "The aim of this mentoring program is to encourage and motivate more women to continue their studies in economics and be inspired to seek careers as economists. First- and second-year women economics students at an Australian university were be eligible to apply for the program. This research project will evaluate the implementation of the mentoring program and will seek to comment on its impact. 

The evaluation of the program implementation will be undertaken through a mixture of survey questions and qualitative research, either focus groups or interviews.

The program's impact will be evaluated through a randomised controlled trial (RCT) however this study does not have sufficient power to have a good chance of detecting an effect, if there is one. Therefore, we are treating this study as a pilot that can inform future, larger-scale RCT evaluations of this program.
