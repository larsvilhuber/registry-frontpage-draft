abstract: "Parent Engagement and Action for Kindergarten Success (PEAKS), a pilot of a new intervention, aims to improve the school readiness of low-income children not enrolled in preschool.  PEAKS will use behavioral tools designed to increase parent engagement to build child skills in the home. The pilot will focus on three aspects of this program in preparation for a full RCT. These are 1) the feasibility and efficacy of two behavioral tools that address different cognitive barriers to low-income parentsâ€™ engagement with their children: namely, present bias and identity salience, 2) the feasibility of recruiting and retaining low-income parents of children not enrolled in preschool, and 3) the feasibility and credibility of different measures of parental engagement. This pilot will inform a full RCT expected to be fielded in 2022."
