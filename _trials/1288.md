abstract: "Oral rehydration salts (ORS) and zinc are highly effective at preventing child mortality from diarrhea yet they are widely underused throughout sub-Saharan Africa. This research aims to test the impact of a novel preemptive home-delivery intervention aimed at increasing the use of ORS and zinc for child diarrhea in Uganda. The intervention aims to increase availability of ORS and zinc and reduce barriers to access by having BRAC's community health promoters (CHPs) deliver the products directly to households for free prior to a diarrhea episode. Under this set-up, the products will be readily available for free immediately after a child comes down with diarrhea. Moreover, we will disentangle the mechanisms through which the intervention could change product use by using a multi-armed approach that tests for the impact of free distribution and premptive home-delivery separately (i.e. preemptive delivery but not free and free but not preemptive delivery). In additional to informing how best to implement such a program, these interventions will allow us to quantify the extent to which price and distance/convenience are barriers to ORS and zinc use. Under certain assumptions, we will also be able to isolate for the effect of information. We will use a four-arm cluster randomized controlled trial designed to measure the impact of each of the three interventions on ORS and zinc use for treating child diarrhea relative to a control group. We will also test for differences between intervention groups. The results of the study will be used to inform program scale-up and to provide insight into the remaining barriers to ORS and zinc use."
