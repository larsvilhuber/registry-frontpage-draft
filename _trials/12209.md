abstract: "This study quantifies the gender-differenciated impact of mental load on labor market outcomes in Italy. Italy is one of the European countries with the lower female participation to the labor market, and the higher gender pay gap. Looking at time use data, in Italy women spend in unpaid work (domestic work and childcare) 13 hours more than their partners on a weekly base. The mental labor associated with the management of the household and caring about the well-being of the individuals of the family may explain part of the gender pay gap. Because of its invisible nature, mental load has received limited attention. A lab-in-the-field experiment has been designed to test the hypothesis that mental load can have a gender-differenciated impact on productivity and self-selection of women and men. The field experiment will involve a group of workers with children less than 18 year-old in the household, working in a public university in Tuscany (Italy). "
