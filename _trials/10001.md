abstract: "Recent literature explores the interaction between AI predictions and users’ decision-making. However, little is known about the influence of the AI developer’s identity on the acceptance or rejection of algorithmically generated predictions by users. This study aims to fill this gap. We draw on social identity theory and analyze how disclosing the developer identity to users impacts users’ demand for and processing of algorithmic advice. We developed a novel experimental design where we disclose the developer identity to participants in an online experiment which will include approx. 800 participants. The two popular constructs of willingness to pay (WTP) and weight on advice (WOA) will operationalize information demand and processing, respectively. Moreover, we aim to disentangle the effect attributable to expected accuracy from social identity effects. The findings of this study contribute to the literature on advice taking, algorithm aversion as well as social identity and may provide practical guidance to organizations for defining strategies that aid in the successful adoption and value creation of algorithmic applications."
