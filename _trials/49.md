abstract: "Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), in collaboration with The Aids Support Organization (TASO), will be testing the efficacy of different strategies for delivering unconditional cash grants to needy recipients in rural Uganda. Our goal is to learn more about the types of delivery methods that will yield the best results for beneficiaries. IPA and TASO will run a randomized controlled trial in 4 districts that are served by two TASO centers in Uganda. Two thousand individuals from the eligible centers will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms or the comparison group. The treatment arms differ in the timing of the delivery of the grant and the intensity of planning and guidance that accompanies the grant.The baseline survey for the first site was conducted in July 2013 and the survey for the second site is scheduled for November 2013.The endline survey for this study will be conducted in November-December 2014.
