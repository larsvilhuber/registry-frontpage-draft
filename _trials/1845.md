abstract: "The main purpose of this experiment is to analyze the impact on student learning from more extensive usage of existing textbooks, in the classroom but in particular for homework, in a challenging educational environment. In addition to student learning, we will also analyze the impact on student and parent aspirations and attitudes towards the school, and teacher efficacy and attitudes towards homework and textbooks. The experiment takes place in South Kivu, DRC, and covers 90 primary schools across 2 districts included in a Results Based Financing project run by the Dutch NGO Cordaid. The intervention gives schools and students in 6th grade incentives to use textbooks for homework assignments, and compliance and usage is followed and monitored. Student learning outcomes will be measured through national test scores as well as independently conducted tests of math and French language skills loosely based on a test conducted on 5th grade students (PASEC) by the CONFEMEN education system.
