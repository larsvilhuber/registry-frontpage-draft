abstract: "This study examines the impact of goal-setting as a strategy for energy conservation by conducting a field experiment with 1,700 community participants. Of these, 300 have smart meters while the remaining participants do not. Subjects will be randomly divided into three groups: Assigned Goal, Adopted Goal, and a control group. We conducted a rigorous balance check to ensure no significant differences in early June electricity usage, household size, house area, and key demographic information gathered during the baseline survey among the three groups.
In the intervention, subjects in both the Assigned Goal and Adopted Goal groups will be encouraged to achieve a 5% reduction in energy use compared to their respective comparison groups. The key distinction is that participants in the Assigned Goal group will be directly instructed to meet this target, whereas those in the Adopted Goal group will first be asked if they are willing to commit to this 5% reduction. The control group will not have a specific goal but will receive information about their bi-weekly electricity usage. The experiment will take place over two phases, one in July and another in September, to assess the short-term effects of the intervention. Following the experiment, we will also evaluate the lasting impacts of these interventions."
