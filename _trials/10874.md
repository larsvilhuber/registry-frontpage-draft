abstract: "With the digital transformation of labor, skills in connection with new technologies are becoming a key requirement for the future workforce. A recent literature demonstrates that economic returns to these skills are dramatically increasing, potentially affecting social mobility and inequality  (Acemoglu & Restrepo 2021; Acemoglu et al. 2022; Alekseeva et al. 2021). In this study, we measure job-relevant digital skills of young adults in Germany using a novel and validated survey measure "youth Digital Skills Indicator" (Helsper et al. 2020). Drawing on longitudinal household survey data, we explore their socioeconomic determinants and compare skill levels of individuals from families with high socioeconomic status (SES) to those from low SES families. As a potential remedy to skills gaps, we study the causal impact of a randomized participation in a mentoring program during early childhood, which was designed to enrich the social environment of children from low SES families. Mentoring programs have not only been shown to have a positive long-term impact on learning capabilities and skills formation, but also to foster character traits, such as self-confidence, self-assessment, and attitudes (Deming 2009; Heckman & Mosso 2014; Kosse et al. 2020). Therefore, we also elicit individuals' confidence in own digital skills and their subjective beliefs about the implications of the digital transformation.
