abstract: "This project will explore how college students make borrowing and educational investment decisions and how colleges can provide information about student loan options to best serve their students. Nationwide, community colleges vary substantially in how student loans are offered to students, a process often termed as “loan packaging.” Some schools include an explicit loan offer as part of their students’ financial aid package. Others provide students with a financial aid package that does not contain student loans. In both cases, students who meet federal requirements are able to borrow, but in previous research, we show that the presentation of loan offers in students’ financial aid award letters has significant effects on loan take-up. In this project, we will work with a large urban university system that currently does not package loans to conduct a similar experiment to determine whether loan packaging provides similar benefits to students.
