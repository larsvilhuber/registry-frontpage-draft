abstract: "Political accountability is regarded as critical for responsive government, economic development, and equitable policy-making. However, effective accountability is often constrained by voters lacking the information required to evaluate the performance of elected politicians. Moreover, conditional on receiving information, political polarization and selective engagement with content may lead voters to reject credible information. Policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is both salient while also polarizing public opinion on policy responses, provides an opportunity for voters to learn about the priorities and competence of governments. To understand how voters hold elected politicians accountable for their crisis management, we conduct a randomized evaluation of the effect of Facebook ads---sent by Data Cívica, a local civil society organization---documenting the policies and COVID-19 case and death counts of Mexican municipalities, relative to other municipalities in the same state, ahead of the June 2021 elections. This project examines the effect of such information, as well as an additional randomized message encouraging consumers to view the information through a nonpartisan lens, on the beliefs, attitudes, and voting behaviors of Mexican citizens in medium-sized municipalities across the country. To this end, we will examine the effects of localized Facebook ad campaigns on electoral returns and the effects of the ads on citizen beliefs and intended vote in the context of a pre-election online survey."
