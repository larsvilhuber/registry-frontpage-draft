abstract: "We develop an experimental design to test for decoy effects in optimal stopping problems, as predicted by salience theory of choice under risk (Bordalo et al., 2012). This experiment complements our existing work (Dertwinkel-Kalt et al., 2020) on salience effects in stopping problems. The (non-parametric) salience predictions on decoy effects that we derive (and plan to test) are inconsistent with other prominent models of choice under risk; in particular, (cumulative) prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979; Tversky and Kahneman, 1992)."
