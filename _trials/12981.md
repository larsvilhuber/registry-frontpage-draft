abstract: "We evaluate the effectiveness of an education savings account program aimed at reducing low-income families' children's risk to drop out from secondary school in Italy. The program (WILL-TORINO) is implemented by a philanthropic organization in Torino, Northwestern Italy since 2020. The program targets 5th graders from low-income families and offers them and their families the opportunity to save small amounts of money (between 5 and 30 euros per month up to a maximum of 1,500 euros over a 6-year period) in a digital wallet. Household deposits are multiplied by four if the money is spent on proven educational expenses (e.g., computers/internet; culture, book purchases; various school expenses, language or computer courses, sports, transportation). In addition to the savings account, beneficiaries are offered a financial education program, educational support and guidance."
