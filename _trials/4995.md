abstract: "Various interventions have been shown to effectively reduce private households’ energy consumption.  We evaluate a randomized controlled trial in the context of the ‘Hot Water Challenge’, an intervention focused on  hot  water  consumption,  to  address  three  research  questions.   Can  regret  enhance  the  effectiveness  of traditional lotteries as a tool to incentivize households?  For which type of household are social comparison interventions effective?  Does an intervention focused on hot water consumption lead to spillovers on cold water or heating energy consumption?"
