abstract: "Central banks regularly measure inflation expectations using density forecasts, in which respondents are asked to assign probabilities to pre-specified ranges of inflation. In previous experiments, we showed that such density forecasts are susceptible to changes in the scale and might not be well adapted to situations were the actual inflation rate changes substantially. Some of these problems can be remedied by shifting the scale of the density forecast by the point forecast of the survey participants. In the current study, we want to explore this further by providing completely personalized scale to the participants.
In the survey, participants are asked up to four questions on their inflation expectations. Three of these questions are similar to those used in the New York Fedâ€™s SCE and ask about inflation expectations over the next 12 months: A binary question if inflation or deflation is more likely, a point forecast, and the aforementioned density forecast. Additionally, some participants are asked to also state their minimum and maximum inflation rate, which we elicit in different ways. This minimum and maximum is then used to construct a personalized scale for the density forecast which is takes the thus stated possible inflation ate into account. For some of the treatments the personalized scale is additionally centered around the previously stated point forecast.
