abstract: "Transition of energy systems to renewable sources and electrification of transportation are key components of most net-zero emission pathways. Electric vehicles could act as ``batteries on wheels’’ to help stabilize the grid and store energy from times of peak renewable production to times of peak consumption, or they could put increasing pressure on the grid if they add to peak demand. We randomly assign vehicle owners to receive incentives to shift charging of electric vehicles towards times of abundant solar generation and away from times when solar generation falls and other sources of demand peak. We implement the experiment using novel telematics data to measure volume and time of charge for over 400 vehicles in Australia. We compare the results of the trial to expert predictions. "
