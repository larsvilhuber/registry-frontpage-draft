abstract: "Despite decades of development work and billions of dollars expended, over 700 million people still live in extreme poverty. Village Enterprise (VE) offers a household graduation program that lasts for approximately one year per cohort, and provides groups of target size three entrepreneurs with cash transfers as seed capital, training, ongoing mentoring by a local business mentor, and support for formation of Savings Groups. The goal is for these households to start sustainable businesses, grow their income and elevate their households out of poverty. VE, IDinsight, Instiglio, USAID, and FCDO are partnering together on the VE Development Impact Bond (DIB), the first DIB for poverty alleviation in Sub-Saharan Africa, to serve over 12,000 households in Western Kenya and Eastern Uganda, over the course of seven cohorts. As the DIB evaluator, IDinsight is conducting a clustered randomized control trial (RCT) to independently measure the impact of Village Enterpriseâ€™s program on increases in consumption and net assets (as a proxy for income). This is a cluster-level RCT with randomization at the village level and the unit of analysis at the household level. The estimated program impact will be measured through a comparison of the treatment group that was offered to participate in the VE program, relative to the control group, which was not offered to participate in the VE program. The effects measured by the evaluation will determine the payments that are made from the DIB to VE for the achieved results. "
