abstract: "This experiment is a part of a larger study which uses observational data from Twitter to measure the effect of German regulation of hate speech (the Network Enforcement Act) on the prevalence of hate in tweets. In our observational study, we measure a decrease in toxicity in tweets tackling sensitive migration and religion related topics due to the implementation of NetzDG in Germany in 2018. In the subsequent experiment, we would like to study if users of Twitter would really perceive the difference in toxicity on Twitter after the law was implemented. We randomly assign users to seeing the Twitter timelines simulated using tweets from before and after the regulation and measure the difference in toxicity as perceived by the experiment participants."
