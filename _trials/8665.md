abstract: "Impact evidence of technologies constitutes a strong foundation for transparency as well as accountability in agricultural research. The robust evidence generated by impact evaluation studies serves as a basis for a higher level of innovation, extension, and technology promotion. This context, in fact, forms the rationale for the present experimental research and the project is proposed with the aim of promotion and impact evaluation of ICAR-Indian Institute of Wheat and Barley Research (ICAR-IIWBR) released barley variety (DWRB 137) at the farmersâ€™ field."
