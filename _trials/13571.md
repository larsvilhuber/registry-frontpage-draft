abstract: "This study examines the existence and direction of stereotype-driven effects in a cooperative setting. Performing a lab experiment with a 2x2 treatment design using a public goods game, the study examines three hypotheses. First, whether participants expect more cooperation from women than from men. Gender stereotypes commonly describe women as more communal and men as more agentic. Such ideas can result in a higher cooperative expectation being placed on women. Secondly, the study examines whether men and women receive equal credit when evaluated for a group's success. When feedback on individual performance is ambiguous, people often engage in "attributional rationalization": estimating an individual's responsibility for a group's success by their characteristics. If stereotypes play a role here, women should receive disproportionately more credit for a group's success than men. Finally, the study examines whether higher expectations come with a drawback by including costly peer punishment. High expectations can also lead to disappointment if group success levels are low. The study examines whether women are punished more harshly than men and whether this is dependent on the expectations held by the punisher.
