abstract: "Individuals often fail to exercise regularly. Time-inconsistent behavior occurs because physical activity incurs an immediate effort and delayed benefits. Economists have sought to exploit present-bias by providing members with financial incentives, but these programs are costly to run and their effect on attendance often fails to persist once payments stop. An alternative is to use low-cost SMS reminders to achieve behavior change. We ran a randomized controlled trial on members of 12 branches of a gym in Montreal (from Feb. 1st 2016) to compare generic reminders for gym attendance with reminders that recalled participants' own exercise goals. Subject were given the choice to participate in the study when signing up or renewing their gym memberships.
