abstract: "Substance use disorder (SUD) is a considerable public health threat in the United States. The availability of effective treatment options, like recovery housing, have the potential to generate substantial public health benefits. However, a barrier to the establishment of services and successful utilization of services is social stigma towards those with SUD and SUD services. We will test whether the perceived agency of those in recovery housing reduces social SUD stigma and paternalistic donations. To vary the perceived agency of those in recovery housing, we will randomly expose participants to a control treatment containing no additional information or a description of recovery housing residents that varies the level of control residents have over their recovery. We will test these descriptions in a nationally representative sample (N = 1,200)."
