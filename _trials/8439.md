abstract: "We study the effects of an information intervention on opioid prescribing and patientsâ€™ health outcomes. The intervention was a personal letter sent to physicians who had prescribed strong opioid painkillers (oxycontin or fentanyl) to a patient who had purchased these medicines for at least three months. These physicians were identified and randomized into treatment and control group. The letter was sent to physicians in the treatment group (n=3,689) on May 27 2019 and to physicians in the control group (n=3,679) on December 10 2019. The intervention letter contained personalized prescribing feedback and information about pain treatment with opioids. We also analyze the effects of the intervention separately for those physicians who received an information intervention in 2017 and/or 2018 as well. The study will inform policy makers on the usefulness of information letters as a long-term policy tool in reducing opioid prescribing and other potentially harmful clinical practices."
