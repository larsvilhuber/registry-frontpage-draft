abstract: "We will study the effects of lowering transaction costs to participating in public procurement on the number and types of firms that compete in the procurement auctions, the types of firms who win contracts and the value-for-money of government purchases. We will focus on procurement reforms introduced by the state of Amazonas and its capital city, Manaus. Both governments are taking actions to reduce the excess of bureaucracy and foster competition in procurement processes. In collaboration with these governments, we will introduce random variation in the implementation of these reforms to learn how different components of the reforms can affect the selection of suppliers and the cost-effectiveness of public procurement.

Within Brazil, governments utilize a variety of different procurement methods. While the use of online platforms for auctions (i.e. eAuctions) has been adopted by the federal government and a few state governments, at the municipal level, public procurement is still largely based on in-person auctions. In both types of auctions, firms are currently required to submit physical paperwork along with their bids.  During this upcoming year, both the state government of Amazonas and the municipal government of Manaus plan to reform their respective procurement systems. The state of Amazonas already has an eAuctions platform, and plans to introduce an electronic system for submission of the related paperwork (i.e. eDocuments). The municipality of Manaus, meanwhile, is moving from an in-person auction system to an eAuctions system, with plans to introduce eDocuments as well. In this project, we will evaluate separately these two components to study how they affect firms decisions to sell to the government."
