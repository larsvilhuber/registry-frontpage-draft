abstract: "Social networks shape an array of decisions, cognitive and non-cognitive skills for students that have long lasting consequences in their lives. Isolated students, due to lack of social connections, often exhibit deficiencies in multiple dimensions including behavioral, personality and academic skills. This project employs a novel randomized desk mate matching strategy based on initial classroom network characteristics to improve student cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes. 

Linking isolated students to popular students can lead to development of cognitive and non-cognitive skills through better integration, positive peer effects and enhanced classroom experience. However, if popular peers are saturated in their socialization capacity, their inaccessibility may result in further ostracization. As a result, it might be better to link two isolated students to each other to form more stable friendships. A priori, it is not clear whether an optimal strategy requires linking isolated individuals to each other as desk mates or linking isolated individuals to popular individuals. The project divides the students in the classroom into three types by their measure of popularity (high, medium, and low). It then employs a two-level randomization design where firstly, desk mate type is randomized between high, medium, and low for each individual and secondly, the proportion of low to high and low to low matches are varied to alter the overall classroom environment. Using the randomization design, the project uncovers the optimal mixing strategy for improved social integration, and development of non-cognitive skills and academic capabilities."
