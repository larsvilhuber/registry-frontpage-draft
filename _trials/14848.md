abstract: "Societies exhibit persistent disparities in inequality levels and redistributive preferences, often accompanied by widely varying beliefs about social mobility that diverge from actual mobility rates. This study investigates the causal relationship between initial economic conditions, beliefs about social mobility, and redistributive choices. We conduct an online experiment where participants are randomly assigned to societies with different levels of initial inequality. They then form beliefs about their chances of being at the top of the income distribution and make consequential decisions about income allocation."
