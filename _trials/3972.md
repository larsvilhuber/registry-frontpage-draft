abstract: "This study will shed light on the potential for digital government-to-person (G2P) payments to facilitate uptake and inclusion in digital financial services (DFS). In partnership with the Bangladeshi government, we conduct a randomized field experiment to examine the impact of a government digitization program for delivering payments to Department of Social Services transfer recipients across 16 districts. In addition, we examine the impacts of (1) a cross-randomized financial literacy training, (2) varying frequency of payments, and (3) a cross-randomized payment schedule provision to vary certainty around receiving payments."
