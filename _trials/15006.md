abstract: "The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) requires the approximately 55,000 registered charities across Australia to submit an Annual Information Statement (AIS) each year. The AIS is an important tool for maintaining sector transparency and accountability. This online form, covering operational and financial details, is submitted through the ACNC Charity Portal at no cost. 

The research is a two-arm randomised controlled trial designed to improve the on-time submission rate of Annual Information Statements (AIS) by charities across Australia."
