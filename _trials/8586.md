abstract: "Tax compliance is difficult to enforce when services are provided to private households. In order to incentivize private consumers to act as third-party reporters, several countries have introduced monetary incentives such as tax credits for consumers that demand legally provided services. We study the causal effects of tax credit schemes for household services on consumers’ willingness to demand legally provided services. We implement a randomized control trial within a survey of consumers in Germany. Survey participants are randomly assigned to 1) a baseline scenario without a tax credit, 2) a tax credit that is granted “at source”, i.e., at the time of service consumption, as in Sweden, 3) a tax credit that can be claimed with the annual tax return, i.e., consumers receive the credit with some delay, as in Germany. We aim to examine how consumers' preferences and their willingness to pay for legally provided services varies across these three conditions. We identify the willingness to pay with a discrete choice experiment. We hypothesize that the existence of a tax credit increases consumers' demand for legal services and their willingness to pay a higher price for legality. We expect that a tax credit granted at the time of consumption is more effective than the tax credit claimed with the annual tax return. "
