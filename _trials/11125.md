abstract: "This paper examines the role of objective information in opinion formation. While fact checking has been widely adopted as a tool to fight fake news, it remains unclear whether people actually use objective information to form their opinions, given that opinion formation may be influenced by a variety of factors. To investigate this, we conducted online experiments on three topics (gun violence, global warming, and Covid-19) to measure the impact of objective information on opinion formation. Participants were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group, with the former receiving objective information about the topic and the latter receiving none. Results indicate that objective information had a non-significant impact on opinion formation across all topics, which raises concerns about the effectiveness of using objective information to counter fake news. Additionally, we find a strong correlation between political position and opinion formation."
