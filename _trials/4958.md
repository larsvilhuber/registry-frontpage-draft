abstract: "We are conducting a field experiment where we randomly assign individuals to a youth camp and randomly assign pairs within those camps. By comparing individuals assigned partners that are of the same religion with individuals assigned to people of other religious faiths we investigate whether close personal contact increases religious tolerance and inter-religious friendship.
