abstract: "Almost 70 million people in Pakistan (35% of the population) do not have access to electricity, as they live in areas, mostly rural,not reached by the grid. Over 75 million (38%), while on-grid, receive low quality energy and experience outages for more than 12 hours per day (IFC 2015). In spite of the significant benefits of access to electricity, the long-run feasibility of grid expansion for the provision of quality electricity to remote areas is often a concern (Greenstone 2014).  The development of market solutions to increase access and energy services in underprovided areas using renewables and alternative energy sources is essential to meet SDG 7, reduce poverty and promote growth. 
We collaborate with Eco Energy (EE), a for-profit company supplying sustainable and efficient solar energy solutions (e.g. lights, fans, mobile chargers, TV)  to households and small business in off-grid areas of rural Pakistan, to evaluate one such market solution. The product is innovative, as it allows to relieve credit constraints to adoption and has strong enforcement feautures: customers access energy through a pay-as-you-go monthly payment scheme and are disconnected when the credit expires. 
The research provides contributions both research and policy-wise. First, we investigate key determinants of the sustainability of the business model and of product take-up, by looking at the trade-off between discipline and flexibility in repayment schedule, which is a debated issue in the microfinance literature (Labie et al. 2015 for a review). Second, we push the frontier of the behavioural and microfinance literatures, looking at individual constraints to repayment. We investigate the role of soft behavioural prompts aiming at stimulating the formulation of intentions and mental plans of action in a novel setting as low-cost solutions to lower default rates.
