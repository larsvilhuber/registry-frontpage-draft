abstract: "We study the deskilling effect of technology on the supply of labor. In previous work, we fielded a vignette experiment embedded in an online survey conducted on a sample of ride-hail drivers in Singapore. The study showed that ride-hail drivers value the use of map apps, and that its loss would lead to a decrease in supply of labor. In this study, we use a similar methodology to delve deeper and investigate valuations of the various capabilities of map and ride-hail apps---basic static route planning, provision of real-time traffic information, identification of where ride-hail demand is high, and facilitating translations of place names into different languages. Our survey also includes an information experiment on autonomous vehicles technology. "
