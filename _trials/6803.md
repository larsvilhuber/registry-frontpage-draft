abstract: "It is a widespread assumption that participation, especially having invested personal resources and having contributed to the initial design phase of a project, fosters an increased feeling of ownership toward the project. This feeling of ownership, in turn, is assumed to contribute to longer-lasting project commitment. This assumption is crucial in supporting a range of policies in areas such as political theory (e.g. Dal BÃ³ et al. 2010), management (e.g. Bartling et al. 2014, Mellizo et al. 2017) and marketing (e.g. Fuchs et al. 2010). It is also the fundamental premise of community-driven development, where beneficiaries of development projects are involved in the decision-making process and provide personal resources such as time, labor, and material (e.g. Casey et al. 2018, Aga et al. 2018). In this project, I run an online experiment to examine the relationship between participation (i.e. decision-power and initial effort investment), and continued investments into a project, with a particular focus on the mediating role of psychological ownership in this relationship."
