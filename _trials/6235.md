abstract: "Previous research has shown that a mindset of "scarcity" - having too little of a resource, be it time, money, or even chances in a game - can change cognition and decision-making. These changes can help explain behavior that may appear irrational. Our research looks at whether similar changes to cognition occur in response to debt, by creating a scenario in which study participants face debt in the context of a simple computer game. Study participants will be recruited and will play the game using Amazon Turk (MTurk). "
