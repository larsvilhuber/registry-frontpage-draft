abstract: "This study aims to evaluate the 'Primeira Infância Melhor' Program (Better Early Childhood, PIM), an ongoing large scale home visiting program targeting socioeconomically disadvantaged families to promote the health, cognitive and socioemotional development of young children during their early years of development in the Brazilian State of Rio Grande do Sul. We explore program expansion within municipalities to randomize individuals (either children aged 0-3 or expectant mothers) into the treatment group or a waiting list whenever there is excess demand. We will assess program impacts on child development, parental practices, parent-child relationship and family access to services. This trial also sets up the building blocks of a longitudinal study design to evaluate medium and long-term effects of PIM on dimensions such as educational achievement and performance, labor market entry and health outcomes."
