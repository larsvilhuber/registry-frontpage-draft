abstract: "The objective of our experiment is to understand how the seating arrangement of a given study group affects learning outcomes. In the high school of our experiment, students in grade ten were divided into study groups. Most of the groups contained six students. To assign students to groups, the usual practice is for the class teachers to divide their students into six tiers of roughly equal numbers, from high initial test scores to low initial test scores, and then pick one student from each tier to form a group. Thus, by design, the different groups have similar overall academic abilities. We randomly selected about half of the groups to be treated groups. In the treated groups, the two students with the highest scores in the baseline exam were assigned to the middle seat of each row. In the remaining groups, seats were arranged mainly according to the preferences of the students."
