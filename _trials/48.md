abstract: "The Ultra Poor Graduation Pilot in Pakistan is a part of the CGAP/Ford Foundation global initiative, currently being implemented in eight countries, that combines safety net programs with entrepreneurial activities to develop a graduation model for the poorest households. In September 2008, we conducted a baseline survey on 1,200 ultra-poor households in 65 villages in the coastal area of Sindh. Public lotteries were held in order to randomly select 600 households to receive the intervention. The treatment households received an intensive support package including: livelihood trainings, productive asset transfer, consumption support, savings plans, and healthcare. By investing in this multifaceted approach, the program strives to eliminate the need for long-term safety net services. A short consumption survey was carried out in September 2010, followed by a midline survey in September 2011 and an endline survey in February 2013.
