abstract: "This project aims to understand if peoples' choices under risk are more likely to reveal preferences that conform to some foundational theoretical properties of risk-preference consistency when -contrary to what is the norm in decision experiments- people are not forced to choose. The incentivized laboratory experiment that will be conducted will feature two rounds of decisions over the same menus of lotteries. Subjects in the control group will be forced to choose in both rounds and at every menu they are presented with. Subjects in the treatment group will be allowed to delay their choice in the first round. Comparing the consistency of subjects' behaviour across groups has the potential to offer a novel robustness check for existing forced-choice methods of risk-preference elicitation."
