abstract: "This research proposes to test a new micro-credit product developed in tandem with BRAC Bangladesh that has been modified in order to make it more useful as a income shock coping mechanism. This new product, called the Emergency Loan is designed to address the main limitations of micro-credit as a useful tool for shock coping by offering guaranteed access to a fixed amount of capital regardless of the level of damage done to the individual. It is hoped that thus designed, the Emergency Loan can provide the positive benefits from micro-insurance while by-passing the issue of low demand associated with those products.  "
