abstract: "This document describes the analysis plan for a randomized experiment examining
the psychological effects of poverty on redistributive preferences. We will recruit
respondents from Amazon Mechanical Turk. We will run one experiment in which
we expose our treatment group to a prime that triggers feelings of poverty (Mani
et al., 2013). In the experiment we recruit 500 participants. We examine the effect
of poverty primes on behavior in a behavioral measure of redistributive preferences
as well as explicit questions on redistributive preferences. This plan outlines the
design of the experiments, the outcomes of interest, the econometric approach and
the dimensions of heterogeneity we intend to explore."
