abstract: "We study the impact of an open banking powered round-up App on consumer spending, saving, and stock market participation using data from a FinTech App. In the first step, we run a panel regression with observational data of existing users. In the second step, we conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment with newly recruited users to establish causality. Study participants are invited to download the App and connect their main bank account, but are not required to use the round-up service. We estimate the effect of the App on consumer financial behavior with transaction and survey data. While round-ups are a standard bank service nowadays, their causal effect has not been investigated yet. We want to close this research gap and contribute to the discussion on how financial technology can be used to promote consumer savings and stock market participation."
