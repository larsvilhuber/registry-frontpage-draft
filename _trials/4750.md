abstract: "We test experimentally how individuals' self-selection into direct communication with their counterparts impacts cooperation. Subjects are randomly matched in pairs and participate together in a task in which cooperation can be beneficial. Prior to the task, subjects decide whether to invest a part of their endowment in order to increase the probability of having pre-task communication with their assigned partner. We  analyze how variations in the subjects' willingness to meet impacts the effectiveness of communication on cooperation. Our design contrasts face-to-face meetings vs. video conferences, given combinations of willingness to communicate. This allows us to disentangle the impact of the willingness to meet as a costly signal from the channel of communication, and to differentiate between the roles of information flow and trust."
