abstract: "This study aims to uncover the underlying reasons why voters support political candidates with traditionally unfavorable characteristics. Utilizing a survey experiment, the study aims to test the influence of identity on votersâ€™ acceptance of negative characteristics. I seek to understand whether voters are inclined to overlook such characteristics when they share an identity with the candidate, particularly when identity is more salient. The focus centers on two distinct characteristics: violence and corruption. To counteract identity-driven voting patterns, I explore two pathways; 1) providing information and encouraging individuals to vote based on their own preferences, and 2) emphasizing unity among religious and caste groups.
