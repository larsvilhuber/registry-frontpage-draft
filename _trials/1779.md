abstract: "It is widely accepted that teachers are the most important factor in school effectiveness. However, there is little robust quantitative evidence of the effectiveness of programmes that improve teacher quality. Of reliable research carried out on teacher development, knowledge based training has typically been found to be ineffective, while programmes that involve teacher observations that are embedded into the school alongside effective feedback have been found to have effects (Taylor and Taylor, 2013). 
Lesson Study is a programme incorporating teacher observations and feedback. It is a professional development programme with a long history of use in Japan and is being increasingly used in the UK. Teachers work in small groups to plan lessons that address a shared teaching and learning goal. They then observe each other’s lessons, focusing on pupil learning rather than the teacher. They then discuss the lesson, refine the lesson plans and repeat the process. In the planning, two 'case pupils' are selected that are typical of a group of pupils in the class, so that the impact of the lessons on pupils with identified barriers to learning can be monitored. After the lesson has taken place, it is discussed, analysed and evaluated by the group of teachers, leading to revisions being made in content, structure and delivery. This process includes feedback from the case pupils in the form of a teacher/pupil interview. The knowledge generated by the whole process is then shared more widely with other colleagues.
An evaluation of the UK’s National Strategies’ Leading Teachers Programme, which involved Lesson Study, showed that those schools using this approach (among others) out-performed a comparison group in both English and Mathematics. Lesson Study also shares many of the key characteristics of effective CPD that were identified in a systematic review produced by the Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Co-ordinating Centre. Research investigating the National Strategies’ Leading Teachers Programme (Hadfield, Jopling and Emira, 2011), of which Lesson Study was a key element, revealed positive impacts on pupil outcomes. However, this study did not take account of potential differences in the treatment and control groups used in the study, nor was it able to follow up the long-term impacts of the programme. 
The trial of Lesson Study incorporated Talk for Learning, an approach which aims to improve the quality of classroom talk in order to increase pupils' engagement, learning and attainment.  Participating schools were asked to deliver Lesson Study within literacy and maths lessons using Talk for Maths and Talk for Literacy with teachers trained in specific approaches for both. The trial was therefore a test of the effectiveness of this method as well as of the Lesson Study approach.
