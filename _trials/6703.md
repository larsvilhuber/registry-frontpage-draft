abstract: "Microtargeted political ads create innovative opportunities for influencing voter’s behavior, which many scholars brand as a threat to democracy (Borgesius et al 2018, Ribeiro et al 2019, Witzleb et al 2019). To study the effects of microtargeted ads we conduct a field experiment on Facebook in which we ask participants to change settings on ad preferences to see fewer ads on a particular topic. Individuals are randomly assigned one of the two topics: social issues, elections, and politics (treatment group) and alcohol (control group). Furthermore, a subset of individuals installed a browser extension that collects data on ads that they receive on their Facebook feed.

Microtargeted political advertising can affect individual decision-making in a variety of ways. To capture its broad impact, we collect a rich set of outcomes including voter turnout (using voter files), voting preferences, policy views, beliefs about views of others, as well as measures of affective polarization. To inform the ongoing debate whether political ads on social media should be more tightly regulated, we also measure ads’ effect on misinformation.
