abstract: "Our experiment will use the national House of Representatives election on October 27, 2024, as the experimental setting. This election takes place within a social context where some members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party were involved in accounting fraud, which has become a significant social issue. Against this background, our experiment aims to identify the influence of social norms related to corruption on individuals' political beliefs and voting behavior."
