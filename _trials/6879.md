abstract: "Financial illiteracy has been linked to many poor financial decisions, which led many countries to adopt financial education programs to improve financial well-being. Although financial knowledge can be greatly improved with regular financial education programs, the gains to better financial behavior and better decisions are limited. A possible explanation is the existence of behavioral biases and heuristics such as myopia, which can undermine good decisions through automated thought processes. Myopia can affect decisions, for instance, through the underestimation of risks and a higher short-term preference. This study proposes a randomized controlled trial experiment to test if a gamified financial education course material directed to increase the awareness of myopia can improve (i) the degree of financial literacy and (ii) reduce the degree of myopic behavior."
