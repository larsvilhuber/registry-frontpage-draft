abstract: "Slaughter is a major point of contamination of meat with food-borne pathogens. This trial, conducted in up to 150 slaughter facilities in Western Kenya, will evaluate the impact of training slaughterhouse workers on good hygiene practices, providing basic hygiene equipment to workers and facility managers, and monitoring workers' hygiene practices through weekly checklists completed by meat inspectors. Workers in a subset of treatment facilities will be given cash incentives conditional on their compliance with adherence to the recommended practices on which they are trained. "
