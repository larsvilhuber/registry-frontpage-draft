abstract: "We collect novel data on people's beliefs about behavioral responses to taxation. First, we recruit workers from an online labor market to work on a task for one hour. We randomly manipulate the piece rate offered to the workers and whether they have to pay taxes on their earnings. We use these data to elicit incentivized beliefs from a representative sample of the U.S. population about how taxes affect people's effort choices. In particular, we provide evidence on whether Republicans and Democrats, who have very different views on redistribution of income and wealth, are divided in their beliefs about how taxes affect economic behavior."
