abstract: "This paper will explore the effect of narratives and information on individuals' perceptions of electric vehicles (EVs) and policies designed to encourage EV adoption. This paper aims to understand how consumers' EV policy preferences can be influenced by misperceptions about EV technology. An online survey will collect participants' preferences for electric vehicles and incentive schemes that encourage electric vehicle adoption across three treatments; (1) a control treatment, (2) treatment with exposure to EV versus internal-combustion vehicle (ICV) information, (3) treatment with exposure to EV versus ICV narratives. The existing literature explores EV perceptions and the effect of informational interventions; however, there is limited research on how consumers' perceptions of public policy may readjust with information interventions."
