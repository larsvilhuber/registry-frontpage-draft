abstract: "This project aims to understand if there is a mismatch between the skills potential workers believe are most valuable in the labor market and the skills employers value. This is a fundamental question to help promote better matching between workers and employers. For this, I will conduct a field experiment in two different populations. One represents the supply side of labor (potential workers), the other the demand side (potential employers). 

Potential workers are all college students that have joined a training program to develop non-cognitive skills. In this training they are assessed on 8 different measures of cognitive and non-cognitive abilities. As part of the program, they will receive a report summarizing their performance on each of the 8 skills. On top of that, they are offered an institutional certificate for three skills of their choosing. This certification of skills can be attached to their CV. One group is told about the certification. A second group is also informed of the potential value such a certificate for the labor market. I will evaluate whether participants are interested in receiving the certificate and conditional on accepting, the skills that are chosen.

Potential employers are all MBA students that also work as managers and decision-makers in firms. They also will be taken from the population of students who have joined a training program to develop non-cognitive skills (this is a separate cohort from the college students). In addition to assessing their skills, they will be asked to indicate their views on which skills are most valuable for different types of jobs. This group is complementary to the supply-side group, and they all receive the same information. 

The data collection is conducted by the Social Behavior and Experimental Economics Laboratory (Social Bee Lab) in Colombia, which is hosted at Universidad Autonoma de Bucaramanga (UNAB). "
