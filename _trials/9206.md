abstract: "Given the social milieu of India, the preference for sons is evident through skewed sex ratios in favor of male children in both the urban and rural areas of the country. The women who fail to bear male children are often subjected to abuse and are misattributed the responsibility of bearing a son. This study shall use an intervention to educate individuals about this misattribution and observe whether it translates into lower levels of domestic violence inflicted on women. It is further expected to address gender norms and attitudes at large and give more bargaining power to women. The study will be conducted among different demographic groups in the city of Ahmedabad, Gujarat. "
