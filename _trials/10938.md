abstract: "Aquaculture is one of the fastest growing industries in Vietnam (Joffre et al. 2019), both nationally and internationally. This specific industry in the VMD is not only currently dealing with climate change, which affects economic gains and pond productivity (Ahmed 2013, Jonell and Henriksson 2015) but also production itself has led to severe environmental impacts, including pollution and mangrove cover loss (Thornton et al. 2003). One of the main sources of water for aquaculture ponds are water canals, where polluted water from the pond during a production cycle is exchanged by clean water coming from public sources such as rivers. Unfortunately, the wastewater from aquaculture is often discarded into the same water body serving as source water, leading to persistent and severe disease outbreaks and economic losses to the farmers (Ngoc et al. 2021; MARD 2017). This is particularly risky for intensive farmers (Anh et al. 2010; Pham et al. 2018). Thus, adaptation strategies to climate change that simultaneously preserve biodiversity, reduce pollution and reduce the risk of losing farmersâ€™ sources of income are needed (Do et al. 2022). 
Our research project aims to disentangle the mechanisms for local farmer cooperation to eliminate water pollution from aquaculture-prevalent communities. More specifically we aim to understand whether farmers can collaborate to build canals to separate polluted from clean water, reducing the likelihood of disease outbreaks in ponds and increasing economic gains for farmers, as well as the sustainability of the ponds and the industry in the long-term.
