abstract: "Many occupations are highly segregated with respect to gender. In predominantly male or female professions, there is often discrimination against the underrepresented gender. This perpetuates gender imbalances. The discrimination could be due to perceived job-specific
productivity differences between men and women. Alternatively, it could result from the belief that teams whose members have the same gender perform better. We investigate the two possible explanations in a novel experiment that varies the initial gender
composition of the teams. We employ three tasks that differ with respect to gender stereotypes. "
