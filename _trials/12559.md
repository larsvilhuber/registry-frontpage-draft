abstract: "How to best rebuild human ties in post-conflict settings is a pressing social question. We study how productivity and intergroup preferences are shaped by emphasizing common identity and emphasizing reference groups. In a few high schools, we will randomize pairs of inter-ethnic students, and ask them to play a cooperative video game. We will collect outcomes on productivity during the interaction, and social preferences during the interaction, and a few weeks later."
