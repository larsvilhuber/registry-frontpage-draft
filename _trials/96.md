abstract: "The Raskin program is a national program by the Government of Indonesia (GOI) that provides subsidized rice to the poor. It is the largest social assistance program in Indonesia. However, many households fail to receive their entitled subsidy. The study aims to test two aspects:  (1) whether providing identification cards for beneficiaries reduces leakages and (2) whether allowing competition for the right to distribute Raskin within the village will improve the program efficiency. The project is being conducted in 572 villages and comprises two phases.  During the first phase, the GOI is testing the effect of providing beneficiaries with Government issued different types of Raskin ID cards and is testing whether the effect of the cards differs by how intensive the information campaigns surrounding  the cards is. During the projectâ€™s second phase, we will randomly assign the village to either a community distribution treatment, an information treatment, or a control group.  In the community distribution treatment, community members will be given a chance to bid for the right to distribute Raskin in randomly selected villages (the parameters of the bidding are also being varied); in the monitoring treatment, meetings will be held to provide information on the state of the Raskin program to community members.
