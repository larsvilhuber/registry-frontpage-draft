abstract: "We want to investigate whether the participation in a app-based panel survey affects job seekers' duration of unemployment. Participants of a high-frequency panel survey on job seekers' well-being serve as treatment group. A randomly chosen subsample of job seekers who agreed to participate in the survey, too, are excluded from the survey to build the control group. The survey data are merged with Information about employment status from administrative records. Members of both groups must approve of the linkage of their survey data with the administrative information. "
