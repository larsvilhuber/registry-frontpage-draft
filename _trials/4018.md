abstract: "This study aims to identify the potential risks that can result from using one of the most popular nudges, reminders, to change behavior. We analyze what drives reminder response and in particular the role of reminders as a means to overcome attentional problems, informational limitations or invoke emotions such as guilt or reassurance. The method of research is a large-scale field experiment. "
