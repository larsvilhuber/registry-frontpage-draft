abstract: "In this follow-up study to our initial experiment in the states of Jharkhand and Madyha Pradesh,
we investigate how a new internet- and mobile-based management and monitoring platform
aimed at improving the administration of a large government workfare scheme in India can facilitate
effective benefits delivery in the state of Bihar, an environment viewed as having relatively
low capacity even within India. Our immediate measure of interest is payment processing time
for program participants. We will also consider how the impacts of the platform are mediated
by previous locality-level performance."
