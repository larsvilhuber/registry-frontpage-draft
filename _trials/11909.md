abstract: "SSA countries suffer from limited capacity to enforce tax payments combined with various obstacles that reduce tax compliance. Domestic revenues need to be mobilized to finance growing needs demanded by population growth, debt levels and declining development aid, amidst rampant tax evasion, corruption and weak institutions. This paper examines the scope of various types of behavioural messages to improve tax compliance and raise tax revenue in a large and diverse East African economy, Tanzania. The external validity of the results can be expected to extend beyond its borders."
