abstract: "The study aimed to investigate the influence of emotional states and cannabis use on selective attention among non-cannabis addicts and cannabis addict individuals. The research employed a mixed-group design and a simple random 3-block design to examine the effect of auditory and visual intervention on selective attention and mood among the two populations. The research employed film clips to evoke emotions of fear and joy and assessed their effects on attention processes. The International Positive Affect and Negative Affect Schedule- Short Form and the Stroop Color and Word Test were utilized to evaluate mood states and selective attention, respectively. The study included participants from both the general population and cannabis addict individuals and compared the differences in selective attention and mood between the two groups. "
