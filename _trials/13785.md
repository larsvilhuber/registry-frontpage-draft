abstract: "We conduct an information provision experiment to study young adults' policy views on worker cooperatives (i.e., firms owned and ultimately managed by their workforce) and intentions to search for a job in such distinct economic organizations. Using a representative sample of individuals aged 18-30 years, we first elicit respondents' priors about the economic performance of cooperatives along well-defined organizational dimensions (productivity, firm survival, employment security and pay inequality). We then create exogenous variation in beliefs by exposing respondents in the treatment group to expert-validated evidence on the behaviour of worker cooperatives vis-a-vis conventional firms along the same dimensions. We analyze whether treated individuals change their beliefs towards cooperatives and become more prone to search for a job in the cooperative sector. We also study whether the causal effect of information varies depending on individuals' behavioural traits (prosociality, risk, and time preferences) and self-reported preferences for job attributes.
