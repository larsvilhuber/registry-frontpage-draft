abstract: "We conducted a randomized control trial to examine the effects of Salt Reduction Efficacy Maintenance (SREM), in reducing the salt intake of older people with high blood pressure. A total of 51 participants in Indonesia were randomly assigned to a control group (n=17), Salt Reduction Training (SRT) group (n=17), or SREM as an intervention groups (n=17). The SREM group was given educational training and a maintenance meeting. The knowledge, attitude toward self-care, and self-efficacy of the SREM group were significantly increased one week after training and maintained one week after a maintenance meeting. The SRT group also showed significant effects for same variables; however, a rebound of food salt concentration was observed one week after the maintenance meeting. No significant improvement was found in the control group. In the maintenance meeting, SREM participants reported positive effects of salt reduction and applying it in different ways based on who cooks at their houses. The SREM program was effective for maintaining knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy of salt reduction practices and could be integrated into community nursing intervention for older people with hypertension/prehypertension.
