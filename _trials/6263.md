abstract: "This project focuses on how entrepreneurs can make decisions under conditions of uncertainty. The goal is to extend prior work that shows that entrepreneurs can improve their ability to make key decisions for the development of their business by adopting a set of practices labelled 'scientific approach'. A scientific approach is a set of routines based on the formulation of theories and predictions tested with data, resembling what scientists do. When entrepreneurs use this approach, they accurately frame and identify the problem they face, while articulating theories, defining testable hypotheses, conducting rigorous tests, and making decisions based on the results of these tests. We conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to obtain rigurous evidence and test the impact of the scientific approach vis-a-vis another popular approach to decision-making, effectuation. When using effectuation, entrepreneurs use a non-predictive approach through which they identify the next steps by gauging what resources they have available, while continuously balancing the interests of self-selected stakeholders with their resources. 
Building on two pilot studies (RCTs) conducted in Italy and involving 116 and 250 founders of new startups, we are conducting another RCT with 500 entrepreneurs to understand the conditions under which different approaches to decision-making enable or constrain entrepreneurial action."
