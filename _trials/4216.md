abstract: "We investigate to what extent laypersons are capable in correctly understanding population growth projections. 
We therefore design an economic lab experiment in which we confront our student subjects with different migration scenarios. In the experiment, all subjects are in the role of the government and have to decide how many migrants to allow in the domestic country so that by the end of a specified time frame, the share of migrants compared to the domestic population reaches a specific target threshold. Deviations below and above this target will be monetarily sanctioned. Subjects are presented 30 different scenarios. The scenarios are held in neutral language. We talk of population “A” and “B” and that the mandate is to allow so many of population “B” to enter the country of “A” in order for the share of “B” to reach a specific threshold by the end of the specified time frame. Subjects are given instructions with detailed information about the experiment, including information how to interpret age pyramids, and how input data such as fertility rate, life expectancy, mortality rates etc. are used to calculate the expected projection growth of the two populations “A” and “B”. At the end of the experiment each subject receives information how accurate the decisions were and be paid according to the decisions in all 30 scenarios.
