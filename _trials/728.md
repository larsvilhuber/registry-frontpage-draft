abstract: "This project will create a dataset consisting of the children of individuals who themselves previously benefited from a randomized health (deworming) program. The project will exploit experimental variation to estimate the causal impact of this earlier program on the health and cognitive development of the recipientsâ€™ children, overcoming the key methodological problem of confounding. The project will survey approximately 1,500 children of the 7,500 respondents in the Kenya Life Panel Survey (KLPS), creating the new KLPS-Kids dataset, to estimate the extent to which a health program can help break the intergenerational transmission of poverty."
