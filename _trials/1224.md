abstract: "Background: Endotracheal intubation is frequently performed in neonatal intensive care units. It is extremely distressing and painful and has been associated with significant neonatal morbidity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Fentanyl as a premedication and its impact in accelerating the endotracheal intubation in neonates at the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
Methods: In this double blind randomized controlled trial study, newborns admitted to NICU of Alzahra Hospital ,Izadi Hospital and Hazrat Masumeh Hospital (in Qom city), requiring an elective endotracheal intubation were randomly assigned in two groups. For the case group Fentanyl was administered 3 mcg/kg slow IV push in 1 mL normal saline in five minutes before intubation, and the control group received 1 mL normal saline five minutes before intubation. From 5 minutes before the procedure until 5 minutes after that, heart rate(HR), blood pressure(BP) and arterial blood oxygen saturation were recorded and compared in both groups. The primary outcome was time to successful intubation.
