abstract: "This project investigates inflation expectations, in particular mean-reversion, trend-chasing patterns and anchoring at the target, in the wake of the rapidly rising inflation in 2022 in the Netherlands. The insights from two types of experiments are compared: a large-scale household survey and an individual decision-making laboratory environment. In both cases, the experimental design involves manipulating information provision about the central bank target and inducing distinct inflation experiences by enrolling participants in a forecasting game based on historical time series. There is a lot of evidence that experience in life shapes people's assessment of economic contexts and their ensuing economic and financial decisions. This project also aims to contrast experience in life versus experience in games and to what extent we can  reproduce life experience of real-world cohorts with lab subjects. "
