abstract: "The objective of the study is to understand how intentions to migrate articulate with aspirations of young men in a rural district in Mali. A randomized controlled trial is attached to a wider survey on aspirations and migration which was submitted to young men aged 18 to 35. The survey will serve to link migration intentions to general and labor market aspirations, and the specific intervention, based on documentaries showing role models from the surveyed individuals' district. The intervention is intended to examine to what extent the diffusion of positive/ negative life stories surrounding migration and the local labor market affects individuals aspirations and intentions to migrate.
