abstract: "Due to climate change, rainfall is becoming scarcer and less reliable in many parts of the world, jeopardizing the agricultural income of already vulnerable populations. Technologies that facilitate water storage within soil and replenishment of soil nutrients could help farmers adapt to climate change. However, farmers may choose to not adopt these technologies due to high costs or a lack of training. In partnership with an international non-governmental organization, the Ministry of Environment and a research firm in Niger, this study will evaluate the adoption and impact of a rainwater harvesting technique called demi-lunes. Farmers in project villages will be randomly assigned to one of three main interventions designed to address the constraints associated with RWH technique adoption:  a training, a training and unconditional cash transfer (divided into an early and a late transfer arm), and a training and conditional cash transfer.  The evaluation will assess the impact of these interventions on farmers' intensive and extensive margin of adoption, agricultural practices, yields and costs. The interventions will be offered during the first year of the project. Outcomes will be tracked for a second year to measure sustained adoption and impacts."
