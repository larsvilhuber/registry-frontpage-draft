abstract: "The efficacy of exposure techniques for disgust has been poorly investigated so far. As it turns out, there are some promising, yet still unclear indications of the efficacy of exposure on disgust responses. Thus, the objective of this paper was to investigate the effects of behavioral interventions, compared to the control condition, especially regarding the level of disgust on people with obsessive-compulsive symptoms at post-intervention and follow-up. The efficacy of the two interventions was investigated within a randomized controlled trial. Participants were selected for scoring above the cut-off on a measure of OC symptoms. Thus, three groups were formed, more precisely a control group and two experimental groups (for counterconditioning and US-revaluation interventions). Those allocated in the experimental conditions participated in one intervention session. As a result, the current study has clinical implications, especially in terms of cognitive and behavioral interventions that can be used to decrease disgust in pathological cases. "
