abstract: "This project aims to create a scalable model of shared toilet infrastructure and management that can be replicated across cities to ultimately reduce open defecation and improve health among the urban poor. In doing so, this project aims to address the design, management and operational challenges of shared toilet facilities commonly found in and around urban slums of South Asia: shared toilets. We define these as toilet blocks serving a fixed population, or in other words: shared toilet facilities for residential areas. Our study location and government partners are the two largest cities in the eastern Indian state of Orissa: Bhubaneswar and Cuttack.
