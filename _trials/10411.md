abstract: "We will investigate the effect of role gender stereotypes about STEM on the gender gap in STEM education. In an RCT, we will study how role models addressing gender occupational stereotypes can affect the beliefs and actual education choices of teenage students. We plan to study 15-18 year-old Swedish students (about 12,000 students) in 300 schools. Classes from participating schools will be randomly assigned to either one of 9 treatments or to control. Treated classes will receive one hour presentations from professionals working in STEM acting as role models or from a study counselor. The study follows a 3 x 3 design, where we randomly vary (a) the type of presenter (female role model, male role model, or study counselor/teacher), and (b) the category of stereotypical beliefs about STEM tackled in the presentation. We will then record educational choices of all students participating in the experiment and survey them on their perceptions about different occupations as well as their educational and occupational preferences. A random subset of students expressing interest in receiving personal advice about their educational choices will have the opportunity to talk individually with a role model. "
