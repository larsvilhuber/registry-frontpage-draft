abstract: "The aim of this study is to determine whether cause-focused promotional messages, compared to product-focused ones, enhance the purchasing behavior of services supporting environmental conservation sold by non-profit organizations. Additionally, we seek to explore how differences in these messages influence consumer behavior towards these services. To verify the effects of cause-focused messages, we will conduct a field experiment using services supporting environmental conservation offered by park administrators in a park located in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan. The services targeted in this research include commemorative cards that print photos taken on the same day, a dedicated app that allows participation in park missions (e.g., quizzes that involve searching for answers around the park), and gifts (e.g., sweets, fruit lottery tickets) awarded to those who complete the missions. When visitors purchase these services, a portion of the sales proceeds will be allocated to funding environmental conservation activities within the park. By purchasing these services, visitors can support these conservation efforts. When buying the services, visitors need to operate a vending machine equipped with a touch screen. We will use the service explanation screens displayed during this operation as an intervention method. The experiment will employ two types of service description screens based on promotional methods validated in the context of Cause-Related Marketing. One is a product-focused service explanation screen, which uses images and text to emphasize the service content and explains the allocation of conservation funds exclusively through text. The other is a cause-focused service description screen, which uses images and text to highlight the allocation of conservation funds, with the service content conveyed solely through text. These screens will be displayed randomly, and based on the screen that visitors see, potential consumers will be divided into a product-focused group (control group) and a cause-focused group (treatment group). Through a randomized controlled trial, we aim to determine whether cause-focused messages, compared to product-focused ones, reduce the dropout rate on the service description screen and increase the purchase rate of services supporting environmental conservation. Additionally, we will explore whether there are differences in consumption behavior trends between the two groups. For this purpose, we will focus on analyzing app usage patterns (e.g., the number of missions completed) and survey responses (e.g., service satisfaction, service valuation, and environmental awareness)."
