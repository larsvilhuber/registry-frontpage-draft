abstract: "The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of giving personalized email feedback to students attending a large public institution in the US. We aim to learn more about what type of feedback is the most impactful on student learning and retention (i.e., what information is more likely to affect student behavior). We also plan to assess heterogeneity on how different group of students (i.e. first generation, gender group, field of study, type of instruction) respond to feedback after receiving their exam scores. To assess the impact of feedback, we will not only look at educational outcomes but we will also elicit from the students how their beliefs have changed after receiving their exam scores and personalized feedback.
