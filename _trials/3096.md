abstract: "We explore the interaction between salience, information and inattention to energy efficiency in China. To date, empirical evidence on the existence of inattention to energy costs comes from the developed world. Our project will establish whether inattention to energy efficiency exists in the developing world. Our experiment will also allow us to explore what drives heterogeneity in inattention. First, we will use plausibly exogenous variation in local air pollution as a measure of the salience of environmental problems to test whether salience has a causal effect on willingness to pay for energy efficiency and whether the effect of information is enhanced or attenuated by salience. Second, we will test whether air pollution, via changes in cognition, has an effect on willingness to pay for energy efficiency and the energy efficiency gap, and whether information is more or less effective when cognition is impaired. Finally, we will test whether priming decision makers to think about environmental or energy costs affects willingness to pay for energy efficiency and estimates of the energy efficiency gap. The results will contribute to our understanding of what drives inattention and will have important implications for the targeting of energy efficiency policy. "
