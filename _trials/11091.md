abstract: "We analyse the effects of the Dutch Nurse Family Partnership, an early-childhood intervention that offers home visits during and after pregnancy to young first-time mothers with low levels of education. In 2007, an RCT was conducted in the Netherlands. Previous research has found beneficial short-run effects by analysing survey data collected during the RCT (Mejdoubi  et al., 2013; Mejdoubi et al., 2014; Mejdoubi et al., 2015). We combine this survey data with administrative data from Statistics Netherlands to look at the medium- and long-run effects of the intervention on parents and children. Hereby, we want to establish whether the intervention also benefits childrenâ€™s development and parental well-being and functioning in the medium- and long-run."
