abstract: "The intervention provides information and two rounds of training on organic farming practices. The intervention is implemented as a randomised controlled trial (RCT). Whereas a first study has focused on the short term effects with respect to knowledge, perceptions, awareness and experimentation (Grimm and Luck, 2023), this study will take a longer horizon and focus an the adoption of organic farming practices, conversion from conventional to organic farming and the effects on farmersâ€™ welfare conditional on adoption. Welfare will be measured through agricultural profits and revenue, nutritional security, subjective wellbeing and health. This study can rely on a four-wave panel data set (baseline, two midline and endline survey) and substantial qualitative field research."
