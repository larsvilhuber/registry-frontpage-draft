abstract: "Evidence on how digital technologies, such as online health information platforms, affect the doctor-patient relationship in general, and the diagnosis and treatment of doctors in particular, is still limited. Both, theoretically and empirically.  In this study, we explore the effects of an information signal, on the diagnosis and treatment behavior of doctors in Georgia. The information signal consists of the patient mentioning that they sought advice from an internet platform on their symptoms. We use an audit study design (standardized patient method) on the clinical case of diabetes type II, a disease which is widespread and on the rise in Georgia in order to test doctorâ€™s response to this signal. The study is conducted with 100 randomly selected doctors in Tbilisi from February to May 2022.  The audit study is complemented with a doctor survey collecting background information on the socio-economic profile and experience of the doctors subject to this study."
