abstract: "We study whether market exchange can promote and transmit the values held by market participants. Specifically, we investigate the conjecture that consumers prefer to exchange with sellers whose behavior reflects consumers’ values and that this, in turn, leads to public support for those values by counterparts seeking improved market outcomes. We document in a laboratory experiment that consumers prefer exchanging with counterparts who express support for their values, even when the exchange has no impact on the actual promotion of those values. Specifically, we find that consumers’ willingness-to-pay is increasing in sellers’ donations to organizations supported by consumers, even though the donations have already been made and cannot be influenced by consumers' purchasing decisions. In turn, sellers anticipate such concern and donate more in support of consumers’ values, but only when there are potential mutual benefits from market exchange."
