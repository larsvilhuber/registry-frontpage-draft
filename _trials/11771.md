abstract: "The purpose of this project is to examine how job seekers react to rejection of their applications in the labor market when recruiters can or cannot discriminate. We design a randomized online survey experiment, where we assign participants to the role of recruiter or job candidate. First, we use this simulated job market to examine recruiters' willingness to hire and candidates' willingness to apply to a job opportunity under a blind or a non-blind hiring process. Second, we examine to what factors do job seekers attribute rejection of their application, and how these factors relate to recruiters' actual discrimination on the market. Finally, we examine whether rejection and the reasons that job seekers attribute to rejection impact their willingness to apply to a new job opportunity. Our goal is to determine the potential discouraging effect of perceived discrimination on job search behaviors. In this document, we provide details about our planned study protocol, including our plans regarding experimental design, data collection, sample restrictions, and main research questions. "
