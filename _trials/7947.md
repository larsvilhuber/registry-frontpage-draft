abstract: "Understanding the strength of social relationships is crucial to explain cooperative and other-regarding behaviour. To this end, researchers have developed a multitude of tools to measure connectedness between individuals. In previous work, Gächter, Starmer and Tufano (2015) showcase that the ‘Inclusion of the Other in the Self’ (IOS) scale is an easy, portable tool that reliably measures relationship closeness. Moreover, in the same work and subsequent research the authors find an even stronger predictive power of the ‘Oneness’ scale, that is a combination of the IOS and We-Scale. However, as this scale requires two distinct items, it lacks the ease that the IOS by itself entails. In this project, we design an extended version of the IOS scale that enables subjects to easily indicate relationship closeness with more nuance whilst maintaining its simplicity. We now validate the tool by exploring whether it captures the strength of relationships as well as the ‘Oneness’ scale and other survey measures."
