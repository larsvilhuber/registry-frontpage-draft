abstract: "We aim to understand whether giving or receiving advice affects the job search behavior of soon-to-be university graduates and their subsequent labor market outcomes. Relatedly, we will examine the impact of their first and second-order beliefs about particular social norms. We run a follow-up survey to study the stability of time preferences and social beliefs, demand for social information as it relates to labor market decisions, and the effect of past experience with MERS on current pandemic behavior.
