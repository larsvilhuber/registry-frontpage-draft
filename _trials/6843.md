abstract: "The objective of our research is to examine the effect of induced guilt on prosocial behavior. We focus on two behaviors â€“ consumption of products with ethical attributes and donation to charitable organizations. Through the ordering of tasks, we also examine whether ethical consumerism can license participants to forego donating. Motivated by findings from previous research, we also seek to examine the role that religious identity plays in the propensity to engage in moral cleansing and moral licensing behaviors. "
