abstract: "In this experiment, we tested a low-cost intervention where we provided co-holders with a reminder that they could use their assets to pay off their debt. For some, they were also explicitly shown what this could be costing them. The experiment was conducted in partnership with a large retail bank from 17 February 2020 through 18 March 2020. 125,328 customers were selected to take part in this experiment based on a set of pre-specified criteria. In designing the different treatments, we sought to test two hypotheses: Hypothesis 1) Co-holders are unaware that they are co-holding; Hypothesis 2) Co-holders are unaware of the costs of co-holding. To test these hypotheses, we randomized participants into one of three messaging groups. The Control group received no notification about their co-holding behavior. The Notice group received an in-app notification reading: “You usually have at least $500 available to pay your credit card debt. Every $100 you pay off could reduce your interest charges.” The Notice + Cost group received an in-app notification in which the first sentence was identical to the Notice condition and an additional sentence read: “... Every $100 you pay off could reduce your interest charges by about $20 per year. Saving $100 only earns about $1 in interest per year. . . ”. Our primary outcome of interest was the amount customers would pay off their credit card balance. We also specified a series of secondary measures for which we thought we could reasonably detect changes."
