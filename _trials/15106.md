abstract: "The lack of participative forest regulation and inclusive forest governance have been disincentives for the adoption of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR) for natural reforestation (Binam et al., 2017; Toudou et al., 2020; Garrity and Bayala, 2019). There is currently missing evidence on how FMNR and the role of land rights can improve natural reforestation. The current study aims to fill these gaps through a partnership with the World Agroforestry Center and World Vision, who have been training farmers on the practice of FMNR in Niger and supporting tree protectionâ€™s conventions. We propose to conduct an RCT to determine the impact of FMNR and land tenure security on reforestation. Understanding such impacts has the potential to improve the use of public funds and international donor funds for reforestation by highlighting high value complementary investments to increase reforestation."
