abstract: "We will use high-frequency data from approximately 800 micro-entrepreneurs in Blantyre, Malawi to explore three main research questions. First, Malawi is a country with fairly low baseline mobile money usage. We seek to conduct an RCT to measure the effect of providing mobile money accounts on savings. Second, we will use high frequency phone logs to measure the effects of savings accounts on daily or weekly outcomes. Third, we seek to study the demand for, and impact of multiple labeled accounts. We will offer multiple savings accounts, and provide encouragement for purpose-specific labeling. Recent research suggests that labeling may promote savings through mental accounting. We hypothesize that mental accounting could also have a downside by making money less fungible between purposes. Our goal is to quantify these costs and benefits by examining differences in savings towards labeled and unlabeled purposes, and in resilience to shocks for those with and without multiple accounts.
