abstract: "The COVID-19 pandemic has forced millions of children to study remotely, where parental involvement has a major role. This study proposes an intervention intended to promote parental involvement in their children’s education through advice-giving. Specifically, parents will be asked to give advice about parental involvement in their child’s education to peers. Recent psychological evidence (Eskreis-Winkler et al., 2019) shows that advice-giving prompts advice-givers to reflect and formulate concrete plans that they can later adopt. Parents will be randomized into a treatment or control group. In the treatment group parents will receive the advice-giving intervention, and will get an additional message designed to enhance the parent-child relationship. The main outcomes are the parent's involvement and child's academic outcomes, and our main mechanisms are parental self-efficacy and stress."
