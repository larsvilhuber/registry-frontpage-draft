abstract: "With over 1.5 billion learners out of school, the COVID-19 pandemic has paralyzed education systems worldwide. This necessitates new education models, including the use of education technology for distance learning. Many efforts to date have focused on higher-technology solutions, such as internet-based smart phone applications. We evaluate two ‘low-tech’ solutions that leverage text-messages and text-messages and direct phone calls to parents to empower them to educate their children in the household. These low-tech solutions have unique potential to reach the masses. While only 15-60% of households in low- and middle-income countries have internet access, 70-90% of households own at least one mobile phone. We run a large-scale trial with 4,500 parent and student phone numbers in Botswana representing half of the regions in the nation. We collect outcomes at one-month intervals. This frequency enables rapid assessment and sharing of results. Results aim to be relevant to both in the present crisis as well as during future school closures, and inform the role of parents and technology more broadly as substitutes rather than complements of the traditional education institution, schools, for human capital accumulation."
