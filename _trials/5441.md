abstract: "We will conduct a randomized control trial with a partnered debt collection agency in Europe, with the goal to ``nudge'' debtors to pay their debts and/or to contact the agency to arrange a personalized payment plan. In total, the debt collection agency will distribute 41,000 hard-copy letters to debtors who currently owe money to the agency, calling on them to settle their debt."
