abstract: "The rewards for different skills and the resulting skill-biased inequality are often determined by exogenous market mechanisms over which individuals cannot exert control. We refer to this driver of income inequality as market luck. From the perspective of economic efficiency, skill-biased inequality might appear justified as higher rewards reflect higher productivity. However, according to the principles of meritocracy, inequalities are only justified if they are due to differences in individual effort and performance but not due to factors outside of individuals' control. In this paper, we design an experiment to study this trade-off in fairness views and improve the understanding of individuals' preferences for redistribution by asking the following research question: Are inequalities arising from market luck perceived as fair? In our experiment, we design a setting where skill-biased inequality between workers arises because exogenous shocks to market demand make certain skills more valuable. We hypothesize that there are fundamental features of market-driven inequalities that increase individuals' inequality acceptance, even though they are fully aware that the market-driven inequalities result from exogenous and random factors.
