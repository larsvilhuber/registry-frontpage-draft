abstract: "Criminal histories used for employment screening serve as a barrier to employment for a large fraction of males, minorities, and workers without college degrees. To enable "fair chance" hiring, employers may filter which criminal background data are visible to hiring adjudicators, potentially suppressing minor or older charges and convictions. Theory and existing evidence point to potentially ambiguous effects of information suppression on hiring of workers with criminal histories, however, since decision-makers may compensate for the absence of information by using group characteristics to infer it. We have partnered with a background check company and one of their client firms to study the effects of policies that alter the set of criminal records available to adjudicators both on the hiring process and performance among those who pass the background check process."
