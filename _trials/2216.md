abstract: "We have partnered with a major US city that has recently developed its bicycle-sharing system to increase access to healthy and environmentally sustainable transport for its citizens.  Historically, the city's transit agencies have used sign-up discounts to incentivize residents to utilize publicly provided transportation options.  However, insights from behavioral science and economics have demonstrated that financial incentives may not be the most (cost-) effective means of encouraging individuals to make presumably welfare-maximizing decisions on the margin.  Here, we aim to understand the importance of personal and community incentives in motivating individuals to participate in the city’s newly expanded bicycle sharing system, a service that may arguably be underutilized due to both myopia in health-related decision-making and the lack of prices to internalize social damages (e.g., pollution and greenhouse gas emissions) associated with conventional transport options.  To discern whether there is a role for altruism and incentives (and assess their interaction), we will randomize the content of mailers that will be sent to approximately 30,000 homes across seven neighborhoods to introduce an expansion of the cycle scheme into those homes’ neighborhoods.  Our analysis will focus primarily on differences in initial uptake (i.e. extensive margin) and the extent of participation (i.e. intensive margin). The results will have implications for cities looking to promote engagement with sustainable public transport.
