abstract: "Luttmer and Singhal (2014) describe tax morale as an “umbrella term capturing non-pecuniary motivations for tax compliance”. We define and measure four components of tax morale. We are interested in evaluating the causal effect of the opinion on public spending on tax morale. We will provide some information treatments to study to what extent perceptions can change after receiving new information on how public spending is controlled in France and if such information treatments will have an effect on the opinion on public spending and on tax morale."
