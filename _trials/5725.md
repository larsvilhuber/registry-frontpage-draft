abstract: "Enrollment in graduate degree programs has expanded in recent decades, facilitated in part through for-profit institutions and other primarily online programs. Despite the prominence of such comparatively broad-access graduate degree programs, there is little evidence on the impacts of such graduate credentials on labor market opportunities. To help address this gap in the literature, this correspondence study compares employer callback rates for occupations in business and health care, two of the most common fields for master’s degrees. For each job opening, I submit fictitious résumés that vary systematically only by master’s degree attributes: each résumé will list a master’s from a for-profit institution, a master’s from another primarily online institution, a master’s from a primarily on-campus regional institution, or no master’s degree. The results will provide some of the first experimental evidence of employers’ preferences between job candidates who attended various types of broad-access master’s programs, and will also facilitate comparisons between candidates with and without master’s degrees. Additionally, subgroup analyses will explore how such employer preferences may vary by the applicant’s sex and race. Such findings will be relevant to prospective students, universities, and policymakers in their understanding of the potential economic returns to master’s degrees. "
