abstract: "This study proposes to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to promote greater use of publicly available aid information in the Government of Timor-Leste's Aid Transparency Portal (ATP) in the decision-making of development policy makers and practitioners in Timor-Leste. The ATP is managed by the Development Partnership Management Unit (DPMU) in the Government of Timor-Leste Ministry of Finance (MoF). Under a five year cooperative agreement (October 2012-September 2017) funded by the USAID Global Development Lab under the Higher Education Solutions Network Program, AidData has worked with DPMU since August 2013 to geocode projects in the ATP by assigning precise latitude and longitude coordinates to project locations, enabling this information to be easily visualized and analyzed. Development practitioners in Timor-Leste can use this information to more precisely target aid programs to populations of need, coordinate their efforts with other actors, and evaluate the impact of their programs.

However, uptake of this information remains limited by government line ministry officials, donor partner personnel, and non-governmental organization staff in Timor-Leste. AidData conducted an assessment in February 2016 to identify challenges to data uptake and opportunities to increase use. The assessment revealed that three of the key barriers to use of the geocoded ATP data were 1) lack of awareness of the ATP, 2) limited capacity to analyze geocoded data for relevant use cases, and 3) poor internet connectivity to access ATP. Based on these findings, Development Gateway will implement the following interventions to promote greater use of the ATP data:

1. Outreach Video: A five-minute video that provides an overview of the features of the ATP and its potential uses. This video will be shown to participants following the baseline survey.
2. Training: A two-day training which will provide in-depth instruction on how to use the ATP portal to conduct key data analyses. This training will be provided to participants following the outreach video and prior to the midline survey.
3. Offline Data Access: ATP data and informational reports will be provided directly to participants via USB drives, circumventing the need to go online to access the data. This treatment will be provided between the midline and endline surveys.

The research team will evaluate the impact of these interventions on promoting increased use of ATP data among government line ministries, INGOs, local NGOs, donor partners, and implementing partners in Timor-Leste. "
