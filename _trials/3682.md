abstract: "We study the impact of a portable "soft" commitment device on the financial behavior of low-income slum dwellers in urban Pune, India. The portable device may add value to existing commitment designs by activating its binding appeal precisely at the point in time when spending decisions are made. 1650 individuals will be randomly allocated to receive either a zip purse and a lock box (treatment arm) or a lock box only (control arm). Both groups are asked to formulate a savings goal and commit to a step-by-step individualized savings plan. We will estimate the causal impact of receiving the portable device on total savings amounts and temptation spending. Further, we will compare study arms with regards to their borrowing activity, expenditure levels, resilience to economic shocks, financial self-efficacy, and female empowerment. Findings from this study can enhance the current understanding of how commitment devices may help alleviate behavioral biases and temptations. 

Additional study component: Trust game
To measure spousal trust and trustworthiness, a behavioral lab-in-the-field experiment was conducted with a randomly selected subsample of 360 respondents and their spouses in additional home visits, after the household had been visited for the endline survey.
