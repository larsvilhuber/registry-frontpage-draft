abstract: "In this study, we conduct a dictator game experiment with face mask wearers and non-mask wearers in Japan, and ascertain allocation tendencies between two anonymous individuals, between two mask wearers or two non-mask wearers, and between a mask wearer and a non-mask wearer. By so doing, we assess “ingroup-favoritism,” “ingroup bias,” and “outgroup bias” of the mask wearers and non-mask wearers, respectively. Here, ingroup-favoritism is defined as the difference between the money amounts allocated in the dictator game experiment to an individual of the same group (i.e., a recipient who wears a mask for the mask wearers and a recipient who does not wear a mask for the non-mask wearers) and to an individual of the different group (i.e., a recipient who does not wear a mask for the mask wearers and a recipient who wears a mask for the non-mask wearers). Also, ingroup bias is defined as the difference between the money amounts allocated to an individual of the same group as the allocator and to an anonymous individual, while outgroup bias is defined as the difference between the money amounts allocated to an individual of a different group from the allocator’s and to an anonymous one. We also examine whether the biases depend on the recipient’s nationality or not."
