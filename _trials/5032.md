abstract: "Finding a job is a full-time job, and it requires basic skills to engage effectively with employers with vacancies. We design and evaluate experimentally the impact of a website we purposely created with useful job search resources: an annotated resume template, a cover letter template, and tips on how to look and apply for jobs. We informed about 2,000 job seekers in Australia about the website via low-cost communication channels and tracked their outcomes for almost two years. We find the website is effective at increasing job-finding rates, particularly among a most receptive group of job seekers aged 35-50 and women within this age group for whom job placements were respectively 6% and 8% higher compared to the control group after three months. We also find a marginal improvement in the quality of job matches. We discuss policy implications for improving targeting of employment programs and the potential for online government services."
