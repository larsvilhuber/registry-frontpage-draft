abstract: "A meta-analysis of randomized control trials (RCTs) which investigate the effectiveness of psychotherapies for treating depression. We will analyze a database of psychotherapy RCTs using a set of techniques to test for and correct for publication bias, estimate power, and calculate pre- and post-experimental odds. "
