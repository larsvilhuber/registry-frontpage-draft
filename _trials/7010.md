abstract: "This study is a survey experiment among conditional cash transfer program facilitators and beneficiaries  in Indonesia to gauge how attitudes towards social protection programs are influenced by programmatic factors and how opinions on how rigidly the conditionality of cash transfers should be enforced may be affected by considering the enforcement of conditionality in one’s own community. This study is embedded in a larger survey of beneficiaries and facilitators of Indonesia’s PKH conditional cash transfer program which gathers information on the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on Indonesia’s poorest households and communities. PKH is one of Indonesia’s principal social protection programs, serving 10 million of Indonesia’s poorest, nation-wide. We send online surveys to all PKH facilitators (approximately 36,000 facilitators) via WhatsApp and SMS and use dynamic random sampling to each facilitator to distribute surveys to up to 5 randomly selected beneficiaries."
