abstract: "The graduation model has demonstrated consistent evidence of cost-effectiveness in uplifting ultra-poor householdsâ€™ livelihoods, though these often remain household enterprises. Graduation models, with intensive coaching, training, and group aspects, may facilitate forming larger, jointly-owned, enterprises. We test group versus individual livelihoods while providing coaching to address hypothesized information-asymmetry barriers to forming equity-sharing group enterprises. We also compare large and small grants, to test for increasing returns to investment above certain thresholds. We will examine process changes, such as whether more participants choose to start group enterprises, short-run business outcomes, and group dynamics, as well as longer-term livelihood profits and household wellbeing.
Leveraging the 20-year Philippines Socioeconomic Panel Survey, we track individual, household, and community-level at regular intervals of 4 years. We seek partial funding for a follow-up survey 4 months post-intervention, complemented by management data from the implementing partner, to enhance our understanding of medium-term impacts of the program."
