abstract: "In the charity market, donations are generally credence goods. In other words, in the charity market, there is an information asymmetry in that it is difficult for donors to know in advance the extent to which their donations improve recipients' welfare (charitable organizations retain this information). Thus, the dictator game, widely used to measure altruistic preference in laboratory experiments, may not correspond to real-world donation behavior because the recipient's welfare is visible.

This study makes a modified dictator game called the patron-dictator game that incorporates the role of charitable organizations. We conduct two games: the patron-dictator game and a standard dictator game in a lab experiment. Through these experiments, we examine two research questions: (1) the extent to which donation behavior in the Patron-Dictator game, which is similar to the real donation market, differs from that in the standard dictator game; (2) how donation information asymmetries affect donation behavior."
