abstract: "A risky skill game is a game in which skill plays an important role but outcomes are also strongly influenced by random factors. Examples are poker or blackjack but arguably also many economic activities like trading on financial markets. In an online experiment we let subjects choose how often they want to play a slot machine with a stop button. In our chance treatments, the stop button has no influence at all and outcomes depend purely on luck. In our skill treatments, subjects have partial control over outcomes. We check whether women play risky skill games less often than men."
