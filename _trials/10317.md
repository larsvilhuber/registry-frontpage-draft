abstract: "There is a huge gender gap in STEM fields: women account for only 29.3% of the employees worldwide in scientific research and development (UNESCO, 2019). This can not only exacerbate gender inequality in the labor market because STEM occupations usually pay higher wages, but also become a self-fulling prophecy when female students have little chance to interact with women in STEM. Female role models are shown to help close the STEM gender gap in educational settings. In this project, randomly chosen classrooms at a high school are exposed to talks given by female scientists. The effects of the intervention on several student outcomes, including student academic performance, their attitudes toward STEM, and their choice of track, will be examined."
