abstract: "Physical Activity (PA) is a popular target for behavioural interventions, but very few sustainably solve the problem of time inconsistency in PA.  One exception is commitment devices, which have been shown to be effective, but take-up is typically low.  I run a randomized experiment to test whether a simple information intervention can increase sophistication about PA time inconsistency and in turn boost the demand for commitment.  The experiment is run through a three-questionnaire longitudinal online general population survey.  Survey respondents are randomly allocated to one of three arms - a control arm or one of two information treatment arms in which they are given information on either their past time inconsistent preferences or time inconsistent behaviour."
