abstract: "The Learning from Administrative Data (LAD) initiative seeks to extend the evidence of the long-term effects of various welfare-to-work programs evaluated in the 1990s, programs that included components such as earnings supplements, child care subsidies, work requirements,
time limits on benefit receipt, and education services. This study focuses on two programs.  The first is Connecticut Jobs First, one of the first welfare reform initiatives to impose statewide time limits on welfare receipt. These time limits were coupled with financial incentives designed to encourage work.  The second is the NEWWS program in Portland, which provided employment and support services to a broad cross section of individuals receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), the prior name for what is now called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF. This study will merge data for the study participants with multiple sources of demographic and administrative data in order to assess effects on employment, earnings, fertility, and mortality. The primary focus will be to assess effects on these outcomes during adulthood for individuals who were children during the program period, although effects will also be estimated for selected outcomes for the adult participants.
