abstract: "The study involves a survey of teachers, administered online. The questionnaire will present different hypothetical scenarios of student answers to exam questions. Half of the participants will be randomly assigned a 'human first grader' questionnaire, while the other half will receive an 'artificial intelligence grading system' questionnaire. Participants will be asked to re-grade the hypothetical student answer. The study aims to (1) measure differences in teachers’ perceptions of grading recommendations when these are provided by a human first grader vs. an artificial intelligence grading system, and (2) identify the mechanisms that drive teachers’ perceptions of such recommendations."
