abstract: "While there have been efforts to improve the availability and transparency of nutritional information in food products through the provision of Nutritional Fact Panels (NFPs), they might not be immediately useful to the casual shopper.

In most standard-format NFPs, the information provided can be overwhelming and underused by the consumer for various reasons including a lack of time, a lack of nutritional literacy, the lack of a comprehensive denomination, or the unavailability of other baseline information (such as Daily Recommended Intake for different nutrients). This is further confounded when consumers wish to compare between products to make healthier decisions. 

The rise in the popularity of online grocery stores is an opportunity to test the effectiveness of comprehensive nutrition tools that can provide consumers with nutritional information in clearer formats that can be better acted upon, overcoming the traditional barriers to healthier food decision-making.

This study seeks to assess the effectiveness of a Smart Shopping Algorithm (SSA) as an add-on to standard web-based grocery stores. The SSA is a suite of features implemented into a web based grocery store with the aim of providing a more convenient and nutrition-focused way of shopping for groceries.

We propose to conduct a two arm cross-over randomized controlled trial (RCT) on an experimental fully functioning web-based grocery store “NUSMart” to assess the effectiveness the SSA. Participants will be randomized into one of two intervention sequences, SSA then control, or control then SSA. In each arm, participants will perform one grocery shopping trip in that version of NUSMart; participants will be required to complete two shops to complete the study. In each shop, the nutritional data of their finalized purchases will be collected.

We hypothesize that diet quality, as measured by weight average Nutri-Score, will be significantly higher in the SSA arm than the control arm. Post-study surveys will collect participants’ experience and feedback for potential future extensions of the SSA."
