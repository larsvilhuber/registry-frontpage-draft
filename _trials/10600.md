abstract: "This RCT consists of a field experiment about bio-waste recycling in the city of Palma (Spain). Citizens of Palma must scan a card that identifies them in order to use the bins meant for bio-waste sorting. Such bins are available on streets throughout the city, next to the bins for recycling of glass, plastic, and paper. The city's waste management company will provide the research team with data on the bio-waste sorting behaviors of the households who signed up to participate in the study, both prior to the treatment and for several months after the treatment (at least until July 2024). The goal is to study how the participants' use of the bio-waste sorting bins is affected by intrinsic (Kantian) and extrinsic (incentives) motives. The participants will be allocated to one of three treatments. Each subject will receive one text message from us, at some point between February 10 and February 24.  

Note: The initial plan was to send messages via Whatsapp in October 2023, and we did send messages to 400 subjects. However, a large enough number of them reported us as spam, implying that we could not send any more messages. This forced us to edit the design (with Whatsapp we could send images; now that we must use SMS instead, we can only send simple text messages). In the current study, these 400 households are dropped from the subject pool."
