abstract: "We evaluate the effects of a pre-election voter awareness campaign (PEVAC) conducted before the 2010 local elections in rural Rajasthan (India). Through door-to-door canvassing and a theater play, the campaign informed voters about the responsibilities of the council head in implementing a large public workfare program (MGNREGS), and about average MGNREGS spending and employment provision per GP in the district. We study the effect of the campaign on entry, exit and electoral success of incumbents and their family, as well as on the  representation of disadvantaged groups that typically participate in MGNREGS (lower castes and women) in 2010 and 2015 elections."
