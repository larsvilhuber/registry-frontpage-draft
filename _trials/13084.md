abstract: "Researchers and practitioners alike are increasingly interested in the role of virtual reality (VR) for engaging and educating policy officials and the general public about environmental issues, with the aim of increasing climate literacy and helping support policy action. While climate researchers and psychologists are highlighting the promise of immersive VR experiences as a novel climate communication tool, research into how to best design and implement climate VR is still in its infancy (Markowitz & Bailenson, 2021). Given their roles and their expertise, policy officials and observers at international climate conferences are a particularly relevant group for testing new digital tools for climate communication.

This study seeks to enhance our understanding of how climate-related VR experiences can be best designed and deployed. To do so, we will expose policy officials at a large international climate conference to the demo of a new immersive VR experience which allows users to view and interact with complex climate data. To understand how participants engage with the VR experience and how they react to it, we conduct a short survey and semi-structured interview before and after the demo. In addition, the survey helps us collect data on climate attitudes and beliefs of policy officials and climate conference participants for descriptive comparisons with the general population.
