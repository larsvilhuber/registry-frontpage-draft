abstract: "In a previous experiment, Gomez-Gonzalez et al. (2021) find that people with Ukrainian-sounding names suffer from discrimination when contacting amateur football clubs. Specifically, they examined Ukrainian, German, and Belarussian-sounding names in Poland.  

Because of the war in Ukraine, we want to repeat the experiment. We want to examine if the attitude towards people with Ukrainian-sounding names changed. We want to contact half of the clubs with an additional signal – namely, we want to see if a small text below the application “Peace for Ukraine” changes the response rate. This gives us an opportunity to see if discrimination changed compared to our previous analysis. Additionally, we can examine if this change is connected towards the attitude of the applicants.

Finally, we want to contact 400 coaches after we finished the experiment and ask them to participate in the survey. The survey includes questions regarding the coaches age, the team’s composition, and similar related questions.
