abstract: "Conventional wisdom has it that market competition drives down prices. The effect of competition on product quality, however, is more ambiguous. This project uses a market-level experiment to identify the causal effect of market entry on agricultural input markets. We randomize the rollout of new agricultural retail stores in Kenya, where agricultural input markets are served by small-scale retail shops with spatial monopoly power. We use this experimental variation in competitive pressure to estimate the effect on prices, product quality, and firm behavior including entry and exit decisions. "
