abstract: "This research explores whether small monetary incentives are effective in reducing smartphone usage by 30% from subjects' baseline usage. In addition, we investigate whether our intervention leads to lasting behaviour change once the incentives are removed. We also study whether the anticipation of receiving incentives in the future, leads to a pre-emptive reduction of smartphone usage. Finally, the study will provide insights on the effects of reduced smartphone usage on educational performance and psychological outcomes, such as cognitive skills."
