abstract: "In recent times, migration has surged globally, accompanied by an increase in negative narratives about migrants and xenophobia. This presents significant challenges for integrating migrants into new communities, even in countries with deep cultural, linguistic, and historical ties to the migrant community. Our study, set in Colombia, aims to examine the effects of a video campaign that counteracts negative stories by elevating positive interactions and experiences between Venezuelan migrants and Colombians, highlighting the migrants' contributions to the host community. To do so, we use WhatsApp for a communication campaign featuring videos of positive experiences between Colombians and Venezuelans, co-created with Innovations for Poverty Action and Barómetro de Xenofobia. This study evaluates the impact of receiving these videos – either directly or with an opportunity to comment on them in mixed groups of Venezuelans and Colombians, mimicking co-watching – on group relations, social norms, social integration, and attitudes toward migration policies. Recognizing the importance of both migrant and native attitudes for successful integration, our experimental design measures the campaign's impact on both groups.
