abstract: "Microcredit is often offered in conjunction with financial education services to train clients through pre-existing infrastructure. In Peru, we attempted to evaluate the impact of a technology-based financial literacy program on microcredit clientsâ€™ financial behavior. Low implementation levels led to a discontinuation of the evaluation.

However, a sub-sample of the trial was used to study another outcome linked to financial services and loan use. Policymakers and microfinance institutions (MFIs) often claim to target poor entrepreneurs who then invest loan proceeds in their businesses. Typically in non-research settings these claims are assessed using readily available but unverified self-reports from client loan applications. Alternatively, independent surveyors could directly elicit how borrowers spent their loan proceeds. That too, however, could suffer from deliberate misreporting. We use data from the Peru trial and another trial in the Philippines in which independent surveyors elicited loan use both directly (i.e., by asking how individuals spent their loan proceeds) and indirectly (i.e., through a list-randomization technique that allows individuals to hide their answer from the surveyor). We find that direct elicitation under-reports the non-enterprise uses of loan proceeds."
