abstract: "In this field experiment, we explore the potential of providing appliance-level feedback to correct households' misperceptions of energy intensities. We also develop a framework to investigate the impact of disaggregate feedback on consumer welfare and derive sufficient statistics to quantify it, thus providing a novel tool for regulatory impact analysis. The context of our study is the deployment of advanced metering infrastructure throughout the world, which involves multi-billion investments into so-called smart electricity meters."
