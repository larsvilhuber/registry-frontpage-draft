abstract: "Improving financial literacy does not always encourage people to behave correctly in various phases of financial transactions. Therefore, finding ways to translate improved financial literacy into actual improvements in financial behavior is important for effective financial education. Through a survey experiment in Japan, this project will clarify the impact of information interventions in financial transaction settings on rational financial behavior based on financial literacy."
