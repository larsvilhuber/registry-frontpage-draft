abstract: "People conform with rules, as laws and social norms, at varying degrees. In this study, we investigate what determines these heterogeneous behaviors. Based on an established paradigm to measure of rule following, we explore socio-economic correlates and further explore the causal effect of the social environment by randomly enrolling children in a year-long mentoring program."
