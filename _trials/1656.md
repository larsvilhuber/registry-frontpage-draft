abstract: "We use a field experiment to estimate rideshare driversâ€™ intertemporal substitution elasticities and their willingness to pay for work arrangements. The experiment offers a subset of rideshare drivers the opportunity to drive under alternative wage schemes which offer higher wages for some choices of hours.  We then study opt-in behavior and labor supply decisions. Our research plan includes subgroup analyses for drivers defined by driving histories, different platform participation histories, vehicle model age, and sex.  "
