abstract: "People are predicted to turn out more in competitive elections where their vote is more pivotal (Riker and Ordeshook 1968) and behave according to theory in lab experiments (Levine and Palfrey 2007; Duffy and Tavits 2008). It is difficult to test this finding in real world settings. There is higher turnout in close elections (Blais and Dobryznska 1998; Nevitte 2000; Franklin 2004; Ashworth et al 2005), but close elections have more media coverage and party spending. Experiments could give information on electoral outcomes, but the control group usually know an election is competitive (Enos and Fowler 2010 provide one exception in a runoff election). Effects of competitiveness on partisanship are ambiguous and differing effects are found in lab work. There may be underdog effects, where people swing behind a party which is behind, or bandwagon effects, where they swing behind a winning party (Levine and Palfrey 2007).

I test the effects on turnout, partisanship and political engagement of being exposed to information, delivered face-to-face, about the likely outcome of the election. The study randomly assigns 2,023 participants from around Soweto in Johannesburg to one of four groups -- control, basic information and two treatments. The basic information message provides information about voting processes at municipal elections and the date of the election. The treatment messages provide information about likely electoral outcomes from the first publicly available pre-election polls conducted by Ipsos-Mori in South Africa.
