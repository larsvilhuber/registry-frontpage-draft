abstract: "In a laboratory experiment, we investigate whether the information revealed during market participation reduces the anchoring bias observed in individual decision making. We control the amount of information available in the market using 3 different market settings: a double auction, bilateral bargaining, and a control treatment in which a good different from the anchored one is traded. Anchors are created randomly for each individual subject by rolling a 10-sided die twice; using a median split subjects are divided into a low anchor group and a high anchor group.  The main question of interest is whether the difference in the willingness to pay between the low anchor and the high anchor group observed before market participation is eliminated after the market participation."
