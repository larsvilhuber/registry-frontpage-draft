abstract: "How to reduce greenhouse gas emissions due to individual consumption patterns? Using a large-scale field experiment at a university canteen, we test the effectiveness of three policies aimed at the reduction of food carbon footprint: 1) provision of clear and reliable information about the carbon footprint of dishes offered on the menu; 2) adjusting dish prices with a pricing system where dish prices and the carbon footprint of the dishes are positively correlated; 3) regulating supply by replacing high-carbon dishes with equally nourishing low-carbon dishes. We further conduct a follow-up survey about the HEC Paris communityâ€™s attitudes toward different policies that could reduce carbon emissions associated with food consumption at the HEC canteen.
