abstract: "In much of the developing world, a large fraction of cross-border trade is conducted by small-scale traders who are often unregistered (informal) or on the verge of informality. These traders face a common question: whether to choose official or unofficial routes when crossing the border. When they use unofficial crossings, they can avoid paying tariffs and limit delays due to official procedures, but they incur significant risks as trading unofficially may result in fines, confiscation of goods, and arrest, or in having to pay bribes to the police to avoid getting caught. The choice between formality and informality is affected by information frictions (knowing the costs and benefits of the different options) and credit constraints (having resources to pay the costs of trading formally). This project will implement two interventions to test for the role of these two constraints. Using a sample of traders who commonly engage in cross-border trading between Kenya and Uganda and through an RCT, we will estimate (i) the impact of receiving a subsidy to (partly) pay for the cost of trading formally and (ii) the additional impact of receiving up to date information about the relative risks and benefits of choosing official vs unofficial crossings; on traders' choice of border crossing (i.e. formalization), and firm performance. We will also investigate the persistence of behavior change for both treatment arms.
