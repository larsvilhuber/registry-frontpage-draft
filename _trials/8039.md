abstract: "In an online experiment, we investigate the role of the environmental self-image of agents for engaging in climate change mitigation. In a real-effort task, subjects can generate donations that offset carbon emissions. Prior to the task, subjects are either positively or negatively manipulated in their environmental self-image. The donations generated in these interventions are compared to a control group. We test whether the manipulation of the environmental self-image induces moral balancing effects (cleansing/licensing) or leads to consistency. Further, we aim to determine heterogeneous treatment effects for High and Low environmental types, to test for the impact of type uncertainty on balancing behavior as suggested in the theoretical work of BÃ©nabou and Tirole 2011 and to observe how balacing evolves over time. In addition, we investigate how and if our variations also affect participants' expectations regarding others' behavior in our task."
