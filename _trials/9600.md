abstract: "The goal of the research project is to evaluate the effectiveness of health messages in encouraging active modes of transport. Active transport refers to walking and cycling, either as the sole mode of transport or as part of trips done via public transport. The intervention will be carried out using a mobile application with an algorithm that automatically tracks mobility and transport mode, including walking, cycling, car, bus, tram and train. The application is currently used to inform individuals of the carbon footprint of their daily transport. During the intervention, half of the application users will be randomized into a treatment group which will receive information on their level of active transport and on the health impacts in the form of reduced risk for certain health conditions."
