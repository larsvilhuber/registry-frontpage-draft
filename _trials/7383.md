abstract: "Affirmative action (AA) policies are used to increase the representation of minorities in candidate pools for hiring and/or promotions. In this study, we plan to use the controlled setting of a lab experiment to understand the true size and nature of the spillover effect of a soft AA (SAA) policy on employer’s discrimination. It allows us to determine 1) whether this effect is predominately positive or negative, and 2) if it is primarily driven by behavioural preferences (i.e., taste-based discrimination) or rational choices (i.e., statistical discrimination). We do this by comparing a soft AA policy based on minority ethnicity status with one for a random “priority” group that has no distinct characteristics, and also by separating hiring decisions from performance estimations. Our findings would provide insights into the mechanisms of the spillover effects of soft AA policies in the labour market.
