abstract: "This auxiliary experiment extends our previous experiments, pre-registered in AEARCTR-0005308 and AEARCTR-0005462. This experiment aims to show that the "justifications" considered in our previous experiments are persuasive: that is, that respondents exposed to them change their behavior in the expected direction."
