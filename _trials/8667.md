abstract: "This project wants to address the causal effect of sibling's gender on attitudes towards gender roles, liberalism and preferences. We plan to collect detailed data on individual attitudes towards gender roles, liberalism and preferences regarding jobs and individual traits. We do so in order to better understand how family composition - in particular the gender composition of siblings - influences individual attitudes."
