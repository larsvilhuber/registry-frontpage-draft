abstract: "This study aims to estimate the causal effects of a public skill certification program on employment and wages of vulnerable workers in Peru. Considering the existence of low levels of employment and wages in poor and low skilled population, due to the presence of information costs on market participants, adverse selection situations on the side of workers and employers, and collective action problems in employment and wage decisions, the Peruvian Ministry of Labor and Employment Promotion (MTPE) has launched the National Program for the Promotion of Labor Opportunities "Impulsa Per√∫," a skill certification program to promote the achievement of quality jobs in highly vulnerable segments of the Peruvian population. Despite the fact that the program has managed to certify more than 12,000 people since 2011, its effectiveness in achieving the proposed objectives has not been studied. Additionally, it has been identified that these types of programs have not been frequently studied in the literature. Therefore, the evaluation of the causal effects of this program has the potential to shed light on the usefulness of this type of initiatives to promote quality employment in developing countries."
