abstract: "We conduct a randomized controlled trial with interested citizens to study the effect of conversations with strangers holding different political opinions on affective polarization, trust, and intentions for political participation. In collaboration with the Swiss Society for the Common Good (SGG), we randomly invite interested people to take part in two time-delayed dialogue weekends, and in between the two event weekends, measure their attitudes towards outpartisan voters and individuals with different political opinions, their general trust towards others as well as their trust towards different institutions, and their propensity to engage in different political activities."
