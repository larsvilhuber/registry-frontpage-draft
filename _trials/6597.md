abstract: "Communication targeting households and firms has become a stand-alone policy tool of many central banks. But which forms of communication, if any, can reach ordinary people and manage their economic expectations effectively? In this large-scale randomized control trial, we provide randomly three groups of a representative population of men in Finland with different forms of communication about the same policies that the European Central Bank (ECB) has implemented in April 2020 to reduce the negative shocks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The communication about the same policies comes from the same source and medium (the twitter account of the Governor of the Bank of Finland, Dr. Olli Rehn), but one group faces a form of target communication, which only discusses the final objective of the policy without discussing the legal instruments the ECB will use to reach such objective, and another group faces a form of instrument communication, which discusses the technical instruments the ECB uses and which form the policy. A control group of subjects faces a tweet discussing a period of economic crisis in Finnish history without any specific connection to the COVID-19 policies implemented by the ECB. Our trial aims to study the effects of different forms of policy communication on the average consumer as well as the heterogeneity of these effects across dimensions we observe in the data---cognitive abilities as a proxy for sophistication and prior income-change beliefs.
