abstract: "This study examines the impact of a 40-hour soft skills training program on employment outcomes for educated young women in a developing country context, an area where existing research is limited, and findings have been mixed. Specifically, we assess how this training influences key employment indicators, including labour force participation, long-term career intentions, employment status, job satisfaction, and tenure. Additionally, the study evaluates improvements across eight targeted soft skills to determine the programâ€™s effectiveness in preparing participants for sustainable employment. This research aims to provide insights into the role of soft skills training in enhancing job prospects and workplace satisfaction among young women in India."
