abstract: "We analyze the three-year impacts of an improved biomass cookstove on child and adult health in rural Ethiopia.  This project is a follow up to a randomized controlled trial on improved cookstove adoption conducted in 2013 in rural Ethiopia. The overall goal of the initial study was to analyze preferences for REDD+ contracts from local communities and whether improved stoves can play a role in meeting a REDD commitment. The initial study involved 504 households in 36 communities. In each community, 14 households were surveyed, with 10 randomly selected to participate in an improved stove trial.  In this follow-up project, we build on the initial surveys and improved stove trials to analyze (1) whether use of the improved stove continued, (2) the possible health benefits arising from lasting use of the improved stoves, and (3) if the improved stoves lead to reductions in indoor air pollution.
