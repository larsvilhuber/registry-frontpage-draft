abstract: "This experiment plans to explore how behavioral tools affect parents' redemption rate of an online gift card. From 2022 to 2023, the About Technology in Math Education Project (About TIME) by us, the Behavioral Insights and Parenting Lab at the University of Chicago, recruited over 1000 families of preschoolers in the Chicago area for a lab experiment and a field experiment to study if educational technology benefits preschoolers' math learning experience. We offered participants online gift cards to incentivize participation. The values of gift cards include $25, $40, and $75. As of April 2024, 283 family parents had yet to redeem the gift cards. To increase the gift card redemption rate with two behavioral approaches, we plan to separate these parents into one treatment group and one control group. Both groups will receive a text message and an email once a week for four weeks. The emails identically include a reminder of the About TIME project and a link to parents' unredeemed gift cards. The text message received by the treatment group tells parents to use the gift card to buy something for their children, and the control group message tells parents to buy something for themselves. We aim to invoke different identities of parents (parental identity or thinking of themselves) and compare how invoking different identities affects parents' decision to redeem the gift card."
