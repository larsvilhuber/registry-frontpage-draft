abstract: "Many firms report trouble filling vacancies, with many jobs filled. How do firms adjust wages and non-wage policies over time to fill their jobs? When firms are provided with an opportunity to automatically adjust features of the job such as pay and skill requirements, are they interested in doing so and under what conditions? To address this issue, we will study two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted by a nationwide staffing platform. In the first RCT, firms are presented with different dynamic adjustment policies that the firm is considering. We will examine whether firms choose dynamic wage and quality adjustment features and under what conditions. The second RCT has already been completed by the Platform. In this RCT, some unfilled job slots are randomly assigned bonus wages, allowing estimation of the labor supply elasticity to the firm."
