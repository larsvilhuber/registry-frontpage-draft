abstract: "We aim to conduct two list experiments in Mali. The first one addresses response biases affecting the reporting of preferences and experiences related to conflict in Mali. The second one addresses response biases affecting the reporting of men's experiences and attitudes towards gender-based violence. In the first one, we plan to conduct a phone survey to interview 1400 individuals (men and women) across Mali. The second one will be conducted with face-to-face interviews surveying men living in Bamako. In both experiments we randomly assign half of the sample to a survey List Experiment and the other half to a Direct Questioning survey. The comparison between the prevalence rates measured with the List Experiment and with the Direct Questioning will provide the size of the reporting bias present in our sample."
