abstract: "Evidences from recent studies point that households across socio-economic status differ in their view on future outlooks of their children – both of education and labour market achievement.  That is, more well-off families, including parents and children themselves, tend to set higher expectations on returns to education and have higher career aspirations. In contrast, disadvantaged families are found not only to have lower income expectations but they are also constrained by a narrow view of career options. The disparity may contribute to more stagnant social mobility as limited information and low aspirations may lead to sub-optimal decisions over education and career choices. The experimental design intends to reduce the gaps of aspirations and income expectations across families of different socio-economic status by conducting a randomized controlled trial at school-level primary and middle school students in Thailand. The trial with the student subjects has two main intervention arms consisting of two semester-long, in-class interactive curricula on: (i) a course on career perceptive, and (ii) a course on Growth Mindset. We plan to measure skills (cognitive and non-cognitive), as well as subjective beliefs regarding educational and occupational choices before and after the intervention. And we will empirically test if our interventions alter the measured outcomes. Moreover, as in many developing countries, children’s beliefs and outcomes are highly influenced by parents. Therefore, the intervention also extends to a randomly selected group of parents who receive both curricula. Specifically for the parent subjects, we further random the assignment of a financial incentive to test whether a conditional reward (on student’s academic improvement) works differently from unconditional rewards."
