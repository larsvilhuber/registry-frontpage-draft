abstract: "In this study, we estimate the impact of financial assistance (in the form of credit relief, and direct cash transfers) in combination with business training on the performance of small entrepreneurs during the COVID-19 pandemic. We establish the causal impact of financial assistance, training, and their interaction using the combination of randomization and natural-experimentation via discontinuities in the formulas determining the size of the financial assistance.
