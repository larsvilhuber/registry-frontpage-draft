abstract: "Introduction. This study aims to investigate the preferences and decision-making processes of users of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), such as e-cigarettes and vapes, and users of conventional cigarettes in Argentina, Chile, and Colombia. As the use of ENDS has significantly increased, particularly among younger populations, understanding the factors that influence the choice between conventional and alternative nicotine products is crucial for developing effective public health policies. This investigation will examine how product characteristics affect preferences and behaviors across different demographic groups, including smokers and non-smokers aged 18 to 65.
Methods and analysis. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) will be conducted to assess preferences among users of ENDS, conventional cigarette smokers, and non-users in Argentina, Chile, and Colombia. The experiment will recruit between 500 and 1500 participants in each country through online commercial panels. The sample will include a range of individuals aged 18 to 65, with quotas ensuring the inclusion of both smokers and non-smokers.
Participants will be presented with a series of choice tasks, where they will make decisions based on various product attributes, including nicotine content, flavorings, health risks, and prices. The collected data will inform policy decisions by highlighting how these factors influence user preferences and perceptions across different demographic and national contexts. Insights from the DCE will provide valuable information for public health authorities in these countries, particularly regarding potential regulatory measures such as packaging policies, advertising restrictions, and product pricing.
Ethics and dissemination. Ethics approval to conduct this study has been obtained from the Ethics Committees of the Universidad Nacional de la Plata, Universidad del Rosario, the University of Nottingham, and Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants, ensuring that participation is entirely voluntary and can be withdrawn at any time. Prior to participation, everyone will be required to complete an informed consent form.
