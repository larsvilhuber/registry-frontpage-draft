abstract: "The region of Cabo Delgado, Mozambique, is currently facing a jihadist insurgency, launched by Al-Shabaab, which has already led to 150,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) to relocate to Pemba, the provincial capital. We will conduct a field experiment in Pemba in which IDPs and local Pemba residents will be joined in community meetings. Two hypotheses will be tested: (1) direct contact between groups will improve tolerance, trust, and social cohesion, and will generate social networks between locals and IDPs; (2) exposure to IDPs will decrease locals’ support for insurgents by revealing the hardships that insurgents impose on IDPs -- as insurgencies typically rely on the connivance of locals to sustain their operations."
