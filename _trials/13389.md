abstract: "This project examines how consumers respond to carbon footprint information. To this end, we run an RCT using a mobile app that differentially exposes participants to information about their carbon footprints. The app provides detailed and personalized information based on users' consumption. We investigate how consumption and other behaviors change in response to exposure to this information. "
