abstract: "This project is a follow-up to an earlier study. In the earlier study (details on https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/5142) we focused on the relationship between self-awareness and dishonesty. We ran an experiment involving around 800 subjects who face different treatments designed to heighten their self-awareness of their own level of honesty. After the treatments subjects played games designed to reveal their level of (dis)honesty. In this follow-up study we intend to follow the basic structure of our earlier study but we will vary the costs and benefits of (dis)honesty in one key experimental task. Our aim is to better understand how different features (such as competition, salience, ego, etc.) alter the costs and benefits of (dis)honesty which in turn alters behavior through interaction with our treatments. In short, we hope to understand the contexts in which self-awareness plays a role in deciding whether to be honest."
