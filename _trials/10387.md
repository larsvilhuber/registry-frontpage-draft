abstract: "Boosting small-medium enterprises (SMEs) tax compliance is essential as SMEs contribute to a significant portion of GDP. SMEs are often characterised by low tax compliance due to low tax literacy. Reminders combined with deterrence messages will be used to induce timeliness in SMEs' monthly income tax payments. This study seeks to answer how the variations of timing and frequency affect a taxpayer's decision to pay or not their monthly income tax. Four message timing and frequency delivery variations will be tested, namely Early, Close, Combined, and Post. The message will be sent through a digital channel, WhatsApp, Indonesia's most popular messaging application. The design of the
message consists of a picture reflecting the monthly income taxes payment and filing deadlines and some text stating the financial and legal consequences of no or late payment and filing. A particular interest of our study is how long taxpayers continue to pay the tax after receiving the message. To analyse this, we employ an inverse survival approach. A survival function, in our context, represents tax non-compliance. The treatment effect, which indicates the differences between treatment groups, will be estimated using a Logit model. It is expected that the results of this study will serve as resourceful guidance for policymakers, primarily the tax authority, to increase tax compliance among SMEs in a
cost-efficient channel. In addition, it also provides a reference regarding the most effective timing of sending a message to taxpayers and how often the message should be delivered."
