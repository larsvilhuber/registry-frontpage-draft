abstract: "Programs targeted at relaxing financial constraints of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) or at enhancing their business practices have shown strong potential for increasing firm growth and employment (de Mel et al. 2008, McKenzie and Woodruff 2008, or Bloom et al. 2013 among others). These programs are thought to foster inclusive growth through their immediate impact on the businesses they target. While impact evaluations of these programs show a positive impact on the firms that are part of the program, these measured effects may happen at the expense of other firms (Cai and Szeidl 2022). This can happen if, for example, these firms compete for the same customers or the same labor force. If so, the welfare implications—the overall economic impact in terms of revenue or employment—of such programs are ambiguous. If firms in the program benefit at the expense of other firms, then total growth generated depends on the relative growth potential of firms in the intervention’s selected group, compared to the firms they are taking resources away from. The program improves welfare only in cases where the firms supported by the intervention generate higher growth than the counterfactual firms who would have gotten these resources had the program not been implemented. Welfare implications are less clear when the firms supported by the program are low-growth-potential firms and capture resources away from high-growth-potential firms.
This project aims at measuring two key aspects that will help address welfare implications of such a program. First, through a clustered randomization design, we will be able to measure whether a grant-awarding program benefits firms at the expense of other similar and geographically close firms. The grant treatment comes packaged with a training treatment but, as we expect the grant to drive most of the effect of the grant and training treatment, the latter is simply referred to as “the grant” in the remainder of this document. The second aspect of this project is a business connectivity intervention similar to Cai and Szeidl 2016, where entrepreneurs are invited to meet weekly over a call in a focus group setting (5 to 6 entrepreneurs per group and 1 moderator to facilitate the discussion) and exchange on business-related issues, and share potential ideas. Allowing firms to communicate with one another might alleviate the information frictions they are facing and attenuate the negative externalities of a grant-awarding program. This project will allow us to measure what is the effect of relaxing these frictions, but also, thanks to a cross-randomization of the grant and the business connectivity intervention, we will be able to understand how solving information frictions interacts with relaxing financial constraints, and in particular whether this combination changes the welfare implications. 
This project will, therefore, help answer the following key questions:
1. Do interventions financially supporting small firms help create net jobs, generate negative spillover, and/or improve overall welfare?
2. Can small firms benefit from an exchange of business-related information with other fellow entrepreneurs?
3. Does connecting small firms to one another improve the overall economic effect of financially supporting small firms? 

This project is part of a World Bank funded project implemented in Liberia called REALISE (Recovery of Economic Activity for Liberian Informal Sector Employment Project). In collaboration with the Liberian government, the research team is evaluating the first component of this project.
