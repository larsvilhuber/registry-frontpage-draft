abstract: "We conduct an information intervention via tailored messages sent to students of a large introductory course at a public university. Messages reference the student's observed assignment completion, thus far in the course, and provide statistics on the typical passing rates of students on that trajectory in the past. Outcome variables studied will be the number of subsequent assignments successfully completed on time and the  subjective expectations, halfway through the semester, of own future assignment completion in the second half of the course."
