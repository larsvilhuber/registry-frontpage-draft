abstract: "This study is about a smartphone App which provides information on administrative processes to citizens in Burkina Faso. The App was designed to ease administrative tasks and shelter citizens against bribery and day-to-day corruption. We will randomize the access to the App within a pool of interested individuals recruited via Facebook and other channel, and will measure outcomes related to the administrative processes conducted by the participants, including bribery paid."
