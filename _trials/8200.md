abstract: "This study investigates the preferences of societies regarding the ethical integration of AI into criminal courts. The growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems across social domains has sparked a heated debate about the ethical ramifications, in particular, over the fairness, accountability, and transparency of these systems. Using a vignette experiment, we explore the normative preferences of the general public over these principles.  By varying the levels of fairness, accountability and transparency in the design of AI in criminal court sentencing, we explore both individual preferences and the impact of chat discussions on their attitude towards AI in courts."
