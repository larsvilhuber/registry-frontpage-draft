abstract: "The aim of this project is to conduct and evaluate the effectiveness of a specific type of parenting intervention in an Irish context. We will run a phased-in randomised control trial on an established positive parenting programme to be delivered by our implementation partner the Midlands Area Parenting Partnership (MAPP) called “Coping with Teenagers Emotions”. 

The Teen Positive Parenting Programme (Triple P) Discussion Group Workshop on ‘Coping with Teenagers’ Emotions’ is a two hour group discussion session and a single follow-up phone call which is led by trained Triple P facilitators in a small group setting of ~15 parents of 11-15 year olds. The research team will not be involved in either the 2-hour intervention or the follow-up phone call. Only the MAPP practitioners will be involved in delivering the intervention and phone call. This discussion group is a preventative intervention which targets parents of teenagers who require support in helping manage the emotional behaviour of their teenagers. The parents will receive a workbook at the start of the discussion group which includes the content to be covered in the session, as well as the practical exercises which will be conducted during the session. 

The motivations for this trial are two-fold. First, the workshops have not been previously rigorously evaluated in an Irish context. Second, the PI Dr. Doyle is currently running a module called Experiments in Economics as part of the MSc in Behavioural Economics in University College Dublin - this evaluation is being undertaken as a student-led project as part of this module."
