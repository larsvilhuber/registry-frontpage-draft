abstract: "This study investigates the impact of providing soil nutrient management training and conducting on-the-field manual soil tests to encourage smallholder farmers to adopt a balanced fertilizer application behaviour and to increase the use of organic inputs. The intervention is implemented as a Randomized Controlled Trial, wherein information and training sessions on soil management practices are provided in a farmer group setting. Villages were randomized into three groups: (1) Control group, (2) T1: 1-day training and (3) T2: 2-day training. In T2 we additionally offered soil testing. This allows us to investigate whether soil testing can augment the effect of soil health management training. Following the in-person training, farmers in T1 and T2 further received access to a digital extension platform. This platform provides videos and tutorials on the material taught during the training. The study relies on dual-wave panel datasets (baseline and end-line survey). Given the local context of unbalanced application of chemical fertilizers, we are particularly interested in investigating whether exposure to training influences farmers’ fertilizer application behaviour. The research design also permits the exploration of potential changes in farm yields, farming profits/losses, and also farmers’ knowledge about nutrient management in response to training."
