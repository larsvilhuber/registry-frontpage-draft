abstract: "It remains an open question how to adapt and individualize learning contents. To tackle this in a digital learning context, we developed an algorithm based on a convolutional neural network that assigns tasks to the learners. Our application is a large online learning platform in which we run a randomized controlled trial. Participants are randomized into three groups: two treatment groups – a group-based adaptive treatment group and an individualized adaptive treatment group – and one control group. We analyze the difference between the three groups with respect to effort learners provide within the platform, their performance within the platform, formative assessments within the platform and their final high-stake standardized exams (summative assessment).
