abstract: "A growing literature explores the effect of donor provided matching funds on charitable giving. However, no previous study has examined the effect of matching funds provided by the recipient of the donation. Such “donee matching” can potentially increase giving because donors may believe that if recipients have “skin in the game,” their charitable contribution is being distributed to those who value it most. We will run a randomized field experiment by inviting approximately 5,000 members of an online representative panel of Americans and asking them whether they would like to donate to a program that provides food for low income households. Within the experiment we will compare the impact on of varying the solicitation message to include either a low recipient monetary contribution (10% of costs) or a high monetary contribution (50% of costs) compared to no contribution. We also test the effect of low and high recipient time contributions. To uncover mechanisms, we will run additional treatments that include contributions from an anonymous donor and using any food (rather than restricted to healthy). Finally, we will study heterogeneous treatment effects by correlating our results to a rich set of data already available on the panel, with particular focus on political ideology. Together, our results will allow us to examine whether recipient contributions encourage giving and how donors respond to the level of the donee match.
