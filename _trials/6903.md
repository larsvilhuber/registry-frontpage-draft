abstract: "The design investigates three mechanisms that can lead to lower-than-optimal take-up of annuities: status quo bias, failure to think through savings choices associated with annuity decisions, and a heuristic aversion to allocating income to states of the world in which there is both high marginal and high absolute utility from money.  We study these through a controlled online experiment run on the AmeriSpeak panel."
