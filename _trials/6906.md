abstract: "The goal of our study is to causally estimate of the effects of noncompetes themselves on the employment outcomes of workers. To do this, we propose to run a large field experiment where we work alongside an employer to randomly assign noncompetes and their salience, as well as wage offers, to examine how the assignment of noncompetes affects individual willingness to accept a job offer. We can also examine subsequent employment outcomes for the workers, and even directly test the workerâ€™s willingness to violate the noncompete by working with a second employer seeking to hire the workers.
