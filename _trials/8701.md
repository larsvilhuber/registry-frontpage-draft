abstract: "Smallholder farmers account 80% of Ethiopia’s farms and are crucial in the effort to end hunger and alleviate malnutrition in the country. However, their farm productivity is poor due to their limited use of modern technologies in agriculture. Evidences show that smallholder farmers lack financial ability to purchase modern technologies that are required to increase their farm productivity and income. Evidently, smallholder farmers in Ethiopia have been excluded from the modern financial system and have no or little access to financial credits provided by financial institutions. With the goal of making financial institutions accessible to rural farmers, the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) in collaboration with relevant stakeholders has designed an intervention plan called ‘Rural Financial Inclusion Program’, to be implemented sooner or later. Among the objectives of the program is making financial credits accessible to rural farmers by tailoring collateral system of financial institutions to the needs of rural households.  The goal of this study therefore is to examine the impact of the ‘Rural Financial Inclusion Program’ (specifically, access to financial credit)  on smallholder farmers adoption of technologies (.e.g., fertilizers, improved seeds, irrigation, etc.) and to what extent the adoption of technologies in agriculture increase farm productivity and income of rural farmers  using Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) Design.
