abstract: "
Study effort is one of the most important determinants of student performance. Are students aware of how effort translates into performance? And if they are not, can we inform them about this relationship to change their study behavior and outcomes? Through a framed field experiment, this project aims to answer these questions in the context of an online language-learning platform."
