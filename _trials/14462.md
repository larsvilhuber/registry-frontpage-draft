abstract: "This study evaluates whether labor contracts combined with rider-and-driver matching platforms can improve the business viability, safety, and scalability of EV adoption into taxi industry. The study also assesses the comparative effectiveness of these labor contracts against other kinds of incentives. Our objective is to empirically validate contemporary discussions regarding the cost competitiveness of EVs in real-world contexts and to investigate how platform-based labor contracts can assist drivers in overcoming financial, liquidity, and behavioral barriers to EV adoption.
