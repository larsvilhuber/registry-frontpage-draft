abstract: "Does a disturbed environment increase strategic/non-pro-social behaviours in subject choices? Does it increase strategic/non-pro-social behaviours in communication? In this experiment subjects are paired with a partner in a Repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma. They are randomly assigned (with a probability of 1/3) to treatment which consists of a random probability of their choices being reversed by the system (so to simulate the noise/disturbance). Assignment to Control, Treatment 1 (20% noise) and T2 (noise 40%) is done by the experimenters through the distribution of different codes. Within each treatment arm, after each round is played and results are revealed, subjects can send a message (choosing from a menu list) to each other before being proposed a further round of the game (with a probability of 75%)"
