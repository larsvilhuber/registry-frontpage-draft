abstract: "We will conduct three data collection activities with aims to benchmark assessment and monitoring results in terms of planting and survival of agroforestry trees, and developing an improved tree-value model for farmers that benefit from an agroforestry intervention. The intervention consists of farmers collecting tree seedlings from centralized tree nurseries at the cell level. First, we will conduct a cluster (cell level) randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 4 provinces, 6 randomly selected districts of Rwanda and 60 randomly selected cells (4,130 households). Due to already high coverage of the program across the country, control cells will be created by pausing the agroforestry tree-seedling delivery in selected control areas for 1 year and replacing it with fruit tree (avocado) seedlings as compensation. We will randomly select 30 treatment and 30 control cells and conduct data collection at two points in time: a planting survey after seedlings are distributed to farmers, and a survival survey shortly before the start of the next planting season. Through this random assignment of treatment and control areas, this study aims to a) obtain estimates of incremental agroforestry trees planted (trees planted by treated group – trees planted by control group), incremental agroforestry trees survived (trees survived in treated group – trees survived in control group) b) estimate potential substitution effects of 1AF trees by all other 1AF and non-1AF species. The second data collection activity will be a tree usage and value survey for farmers with mature trees of our species of interest focused on a selection of the sampled individuals in the baseline survey of the RCT. The third data collection activity will be a tree price survey for tree product vendors and traders. Both surveys will provide necessary information for the tree-value model that allows to quantify the benefits of the program in monetary terms and based on tree use of farmers."
