abstract: "In this project, we investigate the extent to which people manipulate their views on morality and fairness, and their factual beliefs in a self-serving way. We implement an online-survey experiment among a representative sample of adults aged 18 years and older in Germany. Each subject is randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups, and completes two consecutive stages. In stage 1 of treatment 1, the subject divides a fixed endowment of Experimental Currency Units (“Lifepoints”) between herself and a charity which supports children with low educational success. In stage 2, the subject completes a questionnaire about (i) the morality and fairness of supporting children with low educational success, and (ii) beliefs about the reasons, consequences, and improvability of (low) educational success. Treatment 2 is identical except for the fact that the allocation task in stage 1 is between other survey participants (instead of the subject herself) and the charity. By comparing responses in stage 2 between treatments 1 and 2, we assess whether moral assessments and beliefs change to justify previous selfish choices. Treatment 3 is identical to treatment 1, except for the fact that the order of stages is switched (stage 1: questions and moral and beliefs; stage 2: allocation task between subject herself and charity). Comparing allocation decisions between treatment 1 and 3 allow us to investigate the extent to which allocation decisions are affected by preceding (moral) introspection. At the same time, responses in stage 1 of treatment 3 provide a benchmark for moral assessments and beliefs which is uncontaminated by preceding allocation decisions."
