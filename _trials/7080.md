abstract: "COVID-19 has had wide-reaching health and economic consequences across Latin America. Governments throughout the region have begun to distribute approved vaccines to combat its spread. However, absent willingness by citizens to receive these vaccines, vaccination efforts could be seriously hampered. This study first aims to provide descriptive characteristics of vaccine hesitancy in the region. Among the hesitant, we then seek to understand how levels of hesitancy are affected by information relating to health, social, political, and vaccine-specific factors. We thereby aim to identify how governments can frame vaccination campaigns to maximize vaccine uptake. Using an online survey of thousands of respondents across six Latin American countries---Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru---we randomize (i) the type of public health information that respondents receive about COVID-19 and (ii) different motivations for getting vaccinated, as well as conduct a conjoint experiment to identify the different features of hypothetical, but plausible, vaccine distribution scenarios that may influence vaccine uptake. The findings will inform the scope and contours of vaccine hesitancy in the context of COVID-19 and the efficacy of vaccination campaign strategies."
