abstract: "Several studies show that poor mental health is related to negative labor outcomes. Although there is also a long history of research that focuses on employees' mental health and well-being there is little or no research on the mental health of employers. There are three reasons why this is relevant. First, the cognitive complexity and responsibility inherent in owner-manager roles might be sufficient to tax the mental well-being of the employer. Second, a characteristic of owner-manager jobs is social isolation and loneliness which is antithetical to mental health. Third, many employers carry the burden of employees' negative emotions (such as sadness, anger) and behaviors (e.g., aggression, undermining). Given the importance of an employer’s mental health to themselves, their employees, and the organization, it is vital to explore the impact of mental health therapy on owner-managers of small and medium-scale enterprises who face more business constraints in developing countries. Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, this study will evaluate impact of a mental health therapy on job creation (i.e., number of employees) and business performance outcome (such as sales and profits) of female-led Nigerian firms.  The project will recruit female business owners and randomly assign them to receive therapy sessions through virtual reality, through peer-led groups, or to a no-therapy control group. The findings of this study will show the effect of a psychological-based approach on women’s mental health and business outcomes."
