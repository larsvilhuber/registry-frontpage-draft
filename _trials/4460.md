abstract: "The BCUP provides a customized credit services to farmers who cultivate land owned by other either fully or partially. The farmers are provided loans at subsided rate of interest which is a flat rate of10 per cent per year. The effective rate of interest comes to about 15 to 20 per cent on declining balance depending on the mode of repayment of the principal and interest due. According to the rules of the Micro-Credit Regulatory of the Central Bank, NGOs can charge up to a maximum of 27 per cent rate of interest on declining balance for their microfinance operations.

Although the provision of extension service is not stipulated in the terms and conditions of the project contract, BRAC decided to include extension services on the premise that improved farming practices could increase the profitability of farming and thereby improve capacity of the borrowers to repay the loan.

In this project, the experimental intervention will examine the effect on various productivity outcomes among farmers. "
