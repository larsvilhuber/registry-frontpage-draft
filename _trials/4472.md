abstract: "If you were asked to volunteer now or later, what would you choose? We present a model of volunteering that allows for the allocation of effort donations across time. We derive hypotheses regarding the effect of time flexibility on overall effort donations and on the tendency to renege on a promise to donate. We test the predictions of our model using an online experiment with a large sample of Amazon Mechanical Turk workers. We find that flexibility in choosing when to allocate effort donations increases overall donations despite of the added incentive
to renege on a promise to donate. Furthermore, compared to those who donate money, those who donate effort are more generous. The results provide support to the idea that donating effort (i.e., volunteering) differs, in fundamental ways, from monetary charitable donations"
