abstract: "Household garbage causes environmental damage, and landfills run out of space, but recycling technology is improving for more materials to be sold by municipalities to help defray costs. Yet households do not directly benefit from recycling, so they often do not recycle. The goal of this research is to test whether there are cost-effective ways to reduce garbage and increase recycling.  This pilot study will inform the study design of a larger study aimed at estimating the impacts of information interventions and incentives on quality and quantity of recycling and garbage at the household level. As part of the pilot study, we will also test alternative approaches to data collection. "
