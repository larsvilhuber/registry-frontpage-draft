abstract: "Carbon pricing is an effective and efficient measure to reduce carbon emissions. Previous research has shown that acceptance of carbon pricing is highest when its revenues are earmarked for green spending. This is because many people believe that the effectiveness in reducing carbon emissions depends on revenue use. In this study, we test whether explaining that carbon pricing increases the relative price of carbon-intensive products and thereby stirs demand towards more climate-friendly alternatives can increase acceptance and perceived effectiveness of revenue recycling schemes other than green spending. Our randomized experiment is embedded in a large-scale online survey (N=4,000)."
