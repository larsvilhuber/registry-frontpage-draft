abstract: "The goal of preschool education is to support children’s cognitive, physical, and socioemotional development, providing a safe and nurturing environment for young children to learn and interact with their peers. However, in 2022 Mendoza, Argentina, the provincial oral fluency census showed that 59% of 2nd graders are at a critical level and 19% at a basic level, while only 22% are at or above expected. Recognising the lack of access to public preschools and additionally the lack of motivation among parents to send their child to preschools, the Dirección General de Escuelas de la Provincia de Mendoza launched the “Nutrition Language Program” (NLP) to provide tools to ‘vulnerable’ families. The study aims to measure the causal effect in the teacher-led parent training on child development (cognitive, language, motor, and socioemotional skills), child development knowledge and parenting behavior (on aspects such as parenting practices, role efficacy and satisfaction, and parenting competencies), and level of well-being. The evaluation will test if these programme improvements lead to an increase in child development outcomes using a cluster randomised control trial."
