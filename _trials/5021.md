abstract: "There is a growing literature that studies the determinants and impact of motivated beliefs (Di Tella et al., 2015; Zimmermann, 2019). What is, however, hardly understood at all is how human interaction in general, and communication via social media in particular, affect the formation of such beliefs. We conduct a laboratory experiment to analyze this question."
