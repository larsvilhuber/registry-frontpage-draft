abstract: "This registration concerns the second round of data collection for a project where we study experimentally whether males are held more responsible for outcomes than females, using a novel design implemented on a representative sample of Americans. The participants make distributive choices involving men and women and we randomly manipulate the gender composition in the distributive situations. The registered pre-analysis plan should be read as an addition to the pre-analysis plan submitted to the AEA RCT registry on September 28, 2015, concerning the same project."
