abstract: "We study the electoral effects of informational leaflets that debunk false claims made by a right-wing populist candidate. Following Javier Milei's unexpected victory in the zero-round elections (Las Primarias, Abiertas, Simult√°neas y Obligatorias, PASO) in Argentina in August 2023, a non-partisan NGO embarked on a project aimed at informing voters in one of the poorest provinces in Argentina before the first round of elections that the claims Milei made during his election campaign are false and that his promises are unattainable. We collaborated with this NGO to construct a random sample of pairs of electoral precincts with very close zero-round results. We then randomized precincts within each pair into treatment and control precincts. During the election campaign leading up to the first round of the elections, the NGO sends out leaflets by regular mail containing accurate information that corrects false claims of the populist front-runner. These leaflets were distributed to approximately 10% of voters in the treatment precincts in a random subset of the pairs. The mailing by the NGO is done using information voluntarily provided by these voters on a publicly available online resource of the supporters of one of the major centrist political parties, PJ. Many supporters of this party are anticipated to switch their vote to the populist candidate, Milei. We will use the official data on the first and second-round election results at the precinct level to evaluate the effects of this information campaign on voting and estimate the informational spillovers between neighboring precincts."
