abstract: "This project proposes a randomized evaluation of a “hybrid” digital learning program targeted at children in Grades 5-8 in Indian villages. With the COVID-19 pandemic widening the pre-existing learning gap, we hypothesize that programs with appropriate high-quality digital content made available on easily accessible devices and supported by appropriate social support structures can improve learning outcomes and related skills when implemented directly in communities with groups of children. Therefore, this program provides a hopeful solution to making remote learning more accessible and motivating both during school closures and when schools are open. The evaluation will primarily aim to measure the impact of the program on Math and English learning outcomes. The non-profit Pratham has developed and piloted the key elements of this intervention and will implement the program to be evaluated in 276 villages in India."
