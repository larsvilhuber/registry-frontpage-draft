abstract: "We fielded an RCT as part of the Deutsche Bundesbank Household Survey on Consumer Expectations, a large representative survey of German households. In the November 2021 wave of the survey, we provide information treatments to random subgroups of the survey. We split the sample randomly into a control group with approximately 2,000 (untreated) respondents and multiple treatment groups with approximately 1,000 respondents each. Respondents in each treatment group were shown a brief information statement before answering our questions. The treatments provided information on risk-return trade-offs in risky investments, and the potential for green investment funds to contribute to climate change mitigation. "
