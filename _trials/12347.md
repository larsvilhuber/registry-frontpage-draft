abstract: "Nourani et al (2020) find large impacts of a novel general skills teacher training in Ugandan primary schools. The teacher training program is now being implemented in secondary schools and coincides with a comprehensive change in towards a competency-based approach to education in the national curriculum for secondary education. Using this context, this project advances two broad research questions: 1) does effective implementation of pedagogies associated with the competency-based curriculum require teachers to understand their purpose? 2) do the effects of the general skills approach to primary education replicate at secondary? This pre-analysis plan proposes a three-arm design for a follow-up randomized controlled trial to study the effects of Kimanya-Ngeyo's teacher training program on student outcomes in teachers working at 39 secondary schools in rural Uganda. For question 1), this study has innovated new measures of the teacher’s understanding of the purpose of the pedagogical approach they adopt in the classroom. Regarding this, we ask (Q1.1) is there internal alignment in the relationship between a teacher’s understanding of the objectives they are carrying out and their actual pedagogical acts across time? (Q1.2) is internal alignment reflected in students’ experience of a teacher’s pedagogy (external alignment)? (Q1.3) does this purpose-practice alignment drive learning outcomes in students?Question 2) answers three key research questions related to replication in secondary schools: (Q2.1) Does the program replicate in secondary schools? Does the program effect remain high when teachers do not self-select into training? (Q2.2) Are there teacher-to-teacher spillovers? (Q2.3) Does training with a friend improve program effectiveness? "
