abstract: "In this project, I test whether public workers, who have already selected into a job, can be motivated with the adoption of a pro-social mission by the organization. Community health workers affiliated with the District Department of Health in KP Pakistan undergo mission-development therapy sessions for three months where they are introduced to a pro-social mission of the organization and facilitated to discuss the importance of the mission for their everyday work. With the help of the design of the experiment, I separate out whether any subsequent change in the behavior of the workers is driven by an updating of own preferences or if it is primarily driven by a change in expectation of the workplace social norms. Lastly, I use a performance-based financial incentive program to benchmark the results of the mission-development therapy sessions. "
