abstract: "A fundamental challenge for public service delivery is obtaining real-time data on the quality of service delivery to hold front-line service providers accountable.  Such data can reduce corruption and facilitate targeted intervention by higher level decision makers. In this project, we evaluate the effect of a centralized, phone-based high-frequency monitoring (HFM) system in the context of a government cash transfer program. We study whether the introduction of a HFM system improves the performance of bureaucrats overseeing a cash transfer program in India. We will conduct a randomized experiment in which the HFM system is rolled out in some parts of the state and then compare outcomes across treatment and control areas to determine whether the HFM system is effective in improving program implementation.
