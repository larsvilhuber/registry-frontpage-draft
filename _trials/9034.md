abstract: "The Trust Youth Initiative evaluation involves a preliminary impact evaluation--a randomized trial--of an unconditional direct cash transfers (DCT) pilot program (the Trust Youth Initiative) that two nonprofits have received philanthropic funding to implement collaboratively with and for a small number of young adults experiencing homelessness, comparing results to young adults receiving services-as-usual and who do not participate in the Trust Youth program. The evaluation will assess effectiveness on safe and stable housing and bolstering other aspects of young people's well-being and thriving. Public and private funders intend to support the sustainment and scale up of the program beyond the pilot stage, subject to positive evaluation results.
