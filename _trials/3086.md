abstract: "Computer assisted learning (CAL), online courses, MOOCs, and other forms of educational technology have been touted as revolutionizing the way in which students are educated. Of particular importance is the question of whether technology-based interventions can improve education for disadvantaged populations. Although EdTech is being rapidly deployed throughout the developed and developing world there is limited evidence on whether and how it affects academic outcomes. Ultimately, it is important to determine if EdTech has net effects relative to other, more traditional forms of instruction and learning. The purpose of our study is to examine whether and why CAL has a positive impact on student achievement in general but also relative to more traditional forms of supplemental learning (such as pencil and paper workbooks). To fulfill this purpose, we conduct an RCT involving more than 4,000 fourth to sixth grade schoolchildren that are boarding in 130 schools in rural China. The RCT includes three treatment arms: a supplemental CAL arm, a traditional supplemental learning (pencil and paper workbooks) arm, and a control arm. The supplemental learning offered by the first two treatment arms is the same in terms of time and content. The traditional supplemental learning arm serves as an additional comparison group (in addition to the control arm) to the supplemental CAL arm. With this design, we can estimate the effect of supplemental learning (CAL or workbook) in addition to the net effect of CAL (versus traditional learning) on student outcomes. Thus, we can test whether it is the “Ed” or the “Tech” in “EdTech” that makes a difference."
