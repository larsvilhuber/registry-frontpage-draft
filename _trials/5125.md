abstract: "Based on some historical data of online microloan application, repaying performance and facial information, we designed a lab experiment to investigate whether AI prediction can help humans in predicting repayment behavior. We aim to answer the following questions: (1) Do facial photos contain information related to repayment behavior? How can algorithm help humans improve accuracy of judgment? (2) Do humans trust and make use of algorithm predictions effectively? How humans weight their own predictions and algorithm predictions? "
