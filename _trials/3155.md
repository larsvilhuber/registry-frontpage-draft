abstract: "This trial is a replication study, based on a representative US sample, of an earlier study published in a working paper that was based on a student sample (see SSRN-link). For details of the experimental design we refer the reader to the working paper, here we only report the main differences. The purpose of the replication study is to generate results based on a more policy relevant sample of subjects --- a nationally representative sample (in terms of gender, age and region). The results from the new data collection will be added to the paper and presented in the same set of figures and tables. We have no particular prior in terms of whether the treatment effects will be larger or smaller relative to the results from the student sample in the working paper, also because the student population and the representative population are recruited from different societies (Norway and the US). We therefore view the present study more broadly as providing evidence of the generality of the initial findings reported in the working paper.  In addition we will use the larger representative data set to explore heterogenous treatment effects with respect to political orientation and views on income inequality.   "
