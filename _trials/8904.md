abstract: "The study consists of a sequence of online survey and lab experiment. In the survey and the experiment we ask participants questions about their eating behavior. In the lab participants complete a sequence of tasks in which we elicit their attitudes towards animals and meat as well as, in an incentive compatible way, their knowledge about meat and willingness to pay for information regarding meat. Subjects are randomly assigned to two treatments and a control, constituting the exogenous variation in this study.
