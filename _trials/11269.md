abstract: "The aim of the study is to assess the influence of nudges and boosts on individual choice rationality in a risky context based on a laboratory economic experiment. In a between-subject induced budget experiment, participants make repeated allocation choices under different conditions. The choices are displayed graphically as dots on a budget constraint. This allows us to analyse variations in participants' economic rationality. We apply the GARP (Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference) test to assess whether participants strictly abide by the utility maximization framework, and also evaluate their proximity with GARP by computing a rationality score (the Money-Pump Index). We design a total of 6 treatments : 2 nudge treatments, 2 boost treatment and 2 control treatments. In the control treatments, participants did not receive any help to improve their individual rationality. In the nudge treatments, they obtain some help directly within the graphical interface : the area where the choices are compatible with GARP is either directly identified visually, or implicitely selected through a default option. In the boosts treatments, before the series of allocation decisions, participants complete different tasks in order to improve their understanding of GARP principles. We also control for several socio-demographic characteristics including cognitive abilities, personality traits, fatigue, etc. 
Whether or not it is possible to improve economic rationality at the individual level, and how, is indeed currently under researched, especially in an entirely non-parametric framework."
