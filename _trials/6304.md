abstract: "When individuals are exposed to multiple public goods at once, that may differ in investment costs and potential benefit, there is the possibility to contribute in a cost-ineffective manner: investments in one public good could better have been invested in another public good. Within this project we study how cost-effectiveness of investment behaviour relates to the nature of the uncertainty underlying the costs and benefits of investments, and which behavioural factors (i.e. individual preferences/attitudes/cognition) are predictive for cost-ineffective giving in which environmental circumstances.
