abstract: "What are the effects of household uncertainty about inflation? We use a household survey where respondents living in the United Kingdom (UK) provide their expectations for the probability of inflation outcomes to answer this question. We ask respondents to provide us with their prior expectation about inflation outcome allowing us to calculate their individual inflation uncertainty. Next, we treat a random quarter of the respondents by providing information about expected inflation rates, uncertainty about inflation rates, or both from the UK survey of professional forecasters. One quarter is the control group. We then ask respondents to update the probability with which they expect future realised inflation rates. Finally, we ask respondents outcome variables of interest such as their expected spending, expected income growth, and inflation expectations and probability of inflation rates in five years. Provided the treatment is effective in changing the households information set, these questions allow us to identify the effect of the inflation rate expected by households, and inflation uncertainty, on precautionary savings, income growth expectations, and trust in long-run stable inflation outcomes. Furthermore, we follow up on an earlier RCT (AEARCTR-0012949) to study realised spending behaviour in response to the intervention reported by a subsample of households that are surveyed again."
