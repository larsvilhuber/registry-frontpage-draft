abstract: "Growing attention has been given to the association between gendered language and labour market outcomes for women, as across countries a clear negative correlation emerges between those languages that allow for a gender declination and women’s average status in the labour market (Jakiela and Ozier, 2019). However, the extent to which gendered language impacts negatively the labour market outcomes of women is still uncertain. Research effort, mainly in the field of social psychology, has been devoted to understanding the potential detrimental effects of using feminine job titles on the evaluation of female professionals. It has been shown, for example, that female professionals with a feminine job titles receive less favourable evaluations than both male professionals and female professional with a masculine job title (Formanowicz and Sczesny, 2016) and are perceived by men as less warm and less competent, with the consequence of having a lower chance of being employed (Budziszewska et al., 2014). We study this phenomenon in the case of Italy, a country with comparatively low female labour market outcomes, and Italian, a language that requires a gender declination, in a setting of high-skilled professionals working in a relatively wealthy region. In our sample, a significant portion of female professionals in different occupations employ the male declination in their professional life, as this is seen as a way to avoid gender stereotypes and gender discrimination. To test whether this mechanism is at play, we run a vignette study on a sample of high-skilled workers where different (female) professional figures for a specific profession are randomly presented in different scenarios, either as potential colleagues or service-providers, with the female or male gender-declination of the professional title. We measure whether the same individual, with the same observable characteristics, is ranked lower from potential colleagues or clients when presented with the female declination of the professional title.
