abstract: "Regression discontinuity design (RDD) has gained traction across social science fields as a leading quasi-experimental strategy to assess policy impacts. Graphical representation is to a large extent responsible for this growing popularity, and it is now an integral part of any well-executed RDD study. While there is statistically-based guidance on RDD graphical representation, the success of a graphical technique should ultimately lie in the correct perception of policy impacts by the reader of the graph. To date, no research has been conducted to study the role of different RDD data visualization techniques on reader perception. This project fills this gap: it aims to 1) analyze how data visualization techniques affect perception by varying exposure to an array of graphical parameters in a randomized experiment, and 2) use findings from the experiment to establish a set of graphical guidelines for practitioners. Visual representation in the related regression kink design (RKD) will be similarly studied. The findings of this project will contribute to a broader literature on data visualization and serve to create a framework for
evaluating graphical practices in the social sciences."
