abstract: "This document outlines the analysis plan for a study examining the extent to which common cognitive biases vary by socioeconomic status and culture. Our subject pool consists of individuals from Kenya and the USA; in both locations, we survey both low-income individuals from poor neighborhoods (informal settlements in Nairobi, and low-income neighborhoods in Trenton, New Jersey); and students (Strathmore Business School students in Nairobi, and Princeton University graduate students in the USA).
