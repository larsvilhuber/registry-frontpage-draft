abstract: "Educational television has shown promise for creating supplemental learning resources in the home and shaping attitudes in developing countries. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of watching a new educational television program at home. Besides instructional content, a key innovation of the show is its objective to change children's mindsets about reading, gender attitudes and socio-emotional learning (SEL). Following a large-scale RCT, we have designed a lab study that investigates the learning mechanisms that are crucial in building literacy through educational television. In order to better understand if and how the show succeeds in building literacy skills, this study attempts to look closer at whether there is evidence that this program facilitates cross linguistic transfer of reading skills, and expands the RCTs exploration of potential mechanisms. It also evaluates the role of curiosity, distinguishing between trait curiosity and state curiosity, directed toward books, as well as the influence of executive functions such as inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility and working memory on literacy and SEL outcomes. Additionally, the study assesses the moderating effects of caregiver engagement on literacy and curiosity outcomes and explores whether knowledge retention from the show is essential for developing comprehension skills. By integrating qualitative and quantitative methods, the research seeks to identify active pathways linking the intervention to its observed effects."
