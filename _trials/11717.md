abstract: "In the experiment, we study the impact of linking smallholder farmers in value-chain contracting arrangements that provide iron-fortified beans. The partner contract farming companies first identify a set of potential villages to target for expansion into and the randomization then selects a subset of such villages for actual expansion. In a first random sample of villages, farmers receive a crop purchase guarantee and the provision of agricultural inputs (fertilizer and  bean seeds) on credit. A second group receives a crop purchase guarantee and the possibility to buy agricultural inputs for cash. A final group of villages is allocated to control. "
