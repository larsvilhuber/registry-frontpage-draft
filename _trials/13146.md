abstract: "Smallholder farmers in northeastern Nigeria face the triple threat of food insecurity, climate volatility, and conflict. These threats are closely interrelated. As in much of sub-Saharan Africa, climate change has extended dry seasons in Nigeria. This change in seasonal rainfall patterns both limits local agricultural production and disrupts long-standing symbiotic relationships between pastoralist livestock herders and settled agricultural households, leading to conflict between these groups. Exposure to conflict itself contributes to reduced agricultural production and increased food insecurity. With limited social safety nets available, many households exposed to conflict either turn to informal self-employment while reducing agricultural labor or migrate domestically in search of safety, peace, and security.

In this study, we implement a randomized control trial that aims to address these interrelated challenges by promoting the adoption of a bundle of agricultural inputs, including: biofortified seeds, fertilizer, information, and insurance among smallholder farmers in Gombe state, Nigeria. The goal of bundling agricultural inputs together is to leverage agro-ecological complementarities that are critical for optimal crop production. This study aims to promote the adoption of a bundle of agricultural inputs—including biofortified seeds, fertilizer, agro-chemicals, and insurance—among a population of smallholder farmers in Gombe, Nigeria. The research has two stages of outcomes. In the first stage, our main outcome of interest is the purchase of the bundle (i.e., take-up) and adoption of the elements of the bundle. In the second stage, we consider possible “downstream” outcomes such as agricultural yield, consumption/nutrition, risk preferences, and investment choices. Given the location of the study, we will focus an analysis of heterogeneity by whether the household has recently been displaced due to exposure to violent conflict.
