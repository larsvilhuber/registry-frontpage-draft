abstract: "Individuals are often exposed to multiple information messages. Multiple messages should reinforce each other, but recent consumer decision making research finds that combining information messages can reduce the behavior the messages are trying to encourage. We examine how donations to the Clean Water Fund, an environmental organization focused on water issues, are affect by information nudges, specifically when multiple information nudges are combined. To perform our analysis, we collect experimental data and compare monetary donations in a baseline treatment with no information nudge, to donations in three information nudge treatments emphasizing private-health benefits, environmental benefits, or health and environmental benefits to donating. Also, we compare heterogeneity in the treatment effects across environmental involvement and political affiliation. These dimensions will be measured with variables created based on survey responses to questions about environmental consumption, attitudes, and beliefs, and political affiliation and ideology respectively."
