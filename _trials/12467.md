abstract: "Trading behavior can be influenced by biases and individual beliefs, which can significantly impact outcomes in the stock market, particularly for unsophisticated and inexperienced traders. In this study, we aim to investigate the extent to which the decisions of retail traders in financial markets are influenced by finance and stock market-related education. To explore this, we have randomly assigned traders from various brokerage firms in Dhaka, Bangladesh, to participate in a training program covering essential financial topics and stock market fundamentals.  Our objective is to analyze whether and how such a financial educational initiative has impacted the decision-making process of retail traders in the stock market."
