abstract: "This article contributes to assessing performance-based intelligence. In this study, the scale was developed in comparison to the Wechsler intelligence scale and is based on three bits of intelligence i.e. musical, logical and linguistic. The scale proposed that the levels of intelligence range from ability to solve problems containing a limited number of bits of information with obvious relationships to the ability to solve problems that involve critical thinking and logic."
