abstract: "This study assesses the evaluation of a government-owned scalable pre-service training programme - the Fast-Track Transformational Teacher Training Programme (FTTT) in Ghana. The programme transforms existing KG classrooms through teacher training and learning resources, into model practice classrooms for KG1 and KG2 at low cost. The model classrooms are used by public Colleges of Education to host high quality practical placements for student teachers.

Drawn from the governmentâ€™s own KG strategy, the FTTT is fully integrated with, and implemented through, Ghana Education Service (GES) systems. GES officers and College tutors lead the delivery of training, and are responsible for much of the school-based coaching and mentoring which is designed for sustainability. The goal of the programme is to equip student teachers with the knowledge and confidence to apply a pedagogy that replaces rote learning with teaching at the right level, including pupil assessments, for them to implement as newly qualified teachers (NQTs). 

This external impact evaluation of the FTTT uses a randomized control trialto assess impacts of the program for student teachers who had received the training with those who had not. Specifically, impacts are assessed on classroom quality, teacher professional well-being, and student learning outcomes (1) during the student-teaching year, (2) term 1 of the following year when student-teachers are posted as NQTs, and (3) term 3 of the NQT year. A further sub-group of FTTT-NQTs received the additional benefit of their head teacher attending a 4-day training and sensitization workshop. Data collected includes direct surveys with teachers, classroom observations, and direct assessments with KG students."
