abstract: "Does the gender of one’s co-workers/peers have an impact on labor productivity? This question has primarily been studied in the developed country setting. However, this research question is particularly important in patriarchal and traditional societies where gender is salient. In these settings, gender segregation is practiced widely such that, in many cases, the first prolonged interaction with the opposite gender occurs in a workplace. So, social interaction among opposite genders is likely to lead to psychic costs in the workplace (Akerlof and Kranton 2000; Bertrand et al., 2015). This can negatively impact a firm’s output if it comprises a gender diverse employee pool.

The proposed individual-level randomized controlled trial will study the effect of gender diversity in workplace on worker productivity of male employees, their job satisfaction levels and their gender attitudes. Treatment in the form of gender exposure will be provided to men by varying the gender composition of teams in call centers in India. The productivity of male employees in mixed teams (treatment) and all male teams (control) will be compared for a period of 2-3 months.
