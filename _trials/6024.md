abstract: "The Techknowledgey Transfer project tests the concept of providing support to SMEs through student projects. Young people on a range of level 2 and 3 business, administration, enterprise and accountancy courses will work within SMEs to combine each young person's digital confidence, knowledge and understanding of the latest technologies with the SMEs to create and embed models of business and administration technology usage. Projects will be tailored to each business and be user-friendly and sustainable, and lead to improved business efficiencies, freeing up business owners and managers to increase productivity and profitability, as well as benefiting from an improved work-life balance.

The project was awarded to Petroc college through round 3 of the Business Basics programme. Business Basics aims to identify and test the most effective, scalable interventions that encourage SMEs to adopt existing technology and management practices and improve productivity. Business Basics is funded by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), and administered by Innovate UK. "
