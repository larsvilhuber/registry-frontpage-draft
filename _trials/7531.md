abstract: "We conduct randomized survey experiments with US and Canadian residents to study attitudes toward market-based transactions, with a specific focus on whether and how people perceive and elaborate tradeoffs between competing values and goals. In our survey, participants will express their views and preferences over scenarios where companies increase the prices of certain goods in particular circumstances and scenarios where public authorities prohibit these price increases. Our sample will include 4,000 Americans and 4,000 Canadians and it will be representative of the respective populations in terms of gender, race and ethnicity, age, and educational attainment.
