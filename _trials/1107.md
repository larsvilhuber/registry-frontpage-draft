abstract: "Approximately 2.5 billion people around the world are cut off from digital financial systems. These adults –most of them poor– must rely on cash to manage their day-to-day finances and plan for the future.  Researchers and policymakers increasingly view the migration of poor households to electronic payment platforms as an essential ingredient in expanding financial inclusion among the poor. In this study, we partner with garment factories in Bangladesh, a local bank, and a mobile payment provider to ask the novel and important question: Can employers assist their workers in building basic financial capability by offering electronic wage payments? We are conducting a randomized controlled trial to investigate this question where we introduce i) employee payroll accounts and ii) electronic wage payments. First, does automatically depositing wages in a formal bank account improve an agent’s ability to save, thus facilitating either lumpy investment or improved self-insurance? Second, does the impact vary by whether the electronic wage payment is made to a bank account or to a mobile money account linked to the worker’s phone? In addition, we plan to conduct a proof of concept experiment for a new financial product designed to help workers smooth their consumption throughout the month. Through this experiment, we aim to evaluate the sensitivity of a worker's consumption, short-term borrowing and savings to unexpected income earned at the end of the month.  We also will test whether the spending patterns of this end of the month windfall differ for households that had been receiving electronic wage payments. Finally, we will collect short-run productivity measures for the subset of workers in the follow-up experiment to measure whether they are affected by the increase in end of the month income. "
