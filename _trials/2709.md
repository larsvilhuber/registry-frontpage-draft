abstract: "Why don't communities adopt democratic or inclusive institutions after a community-driven development program, despite professing higher pro-social values in surveys? Using a novel field experiment which elicits ex-ante valuation of different decision-making processes, combined with a randomly-assigned community-driven development program, we distinguish between three potential explanations: experimenter demand effects in surveys; preferences over different approaches to decision-making; and resistance to change from vested interests."
