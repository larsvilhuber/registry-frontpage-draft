abstract: "The semi-arid region of Northeastern Brazil is characterized by high levels of water and food insecurity as well as gender inequality. Frequent and extended droughts threaten the livelihoods of rural households. To address this, local NGO ASA with financial backing from the Federal Brazilian government has targeted the area with several social programs, most recently the expansion of the Agricultural Cisterns program known as P1+2. The P1+2 program seeks to increase the resilience of poor households to climate shocks by providing them with water storage capacity (a large cistern), a plan to adapt their production strategies (technical assistance), and cash to implement that plan. Moreover, the program seeks to promote female empowerment by reducing the intra-household imbalance of incomes and decision-making. The latter goal is addressed by placing the cistern in the part of agricultural land that is traditionally under the femaleâ€™s control (the plot of land next to the main residence).

The new rainwater fed cisterns have capacity to store 52,000 liters, substantially improving water supply for irrigation of small crops and livestock during the dry season. This research project will use a cluster-randomized controlled trial to evaluate an addition of 2,000 households to the program, distributed across 63 municipalities in nine Northeastern Brazilian states to measure the causal effect of P1+2 on a series of indicators of climate resilience, female empowerment, and well-being.

Beyond evaluating a large-scale social program with high transformative potential, the research project aims to extract lessons which can be generalized to other contexts in which climate vulnerability and gender imbalances are pervasive.
