abstract: "The project will assess the acceptability, feasibility, and potential impact of a novel prize-linked savings intervention designed to shift menâ€™s income away from risky health behaviors and towards saving for the future in a community with continued high HIV incidence in Kenya. Prize-linked savings accounts have been in existence for many years in some countries and they offer savers a random, lottery-like payout proportional to the amount participants save, instead of traditional interest income. The project will enroll men who live in communities with high HIV risk, randomize them to the savings intervention, and assess changes in key economic and self-reported health outcomes over a 3-6 month period with baseline and follow-up surveys.
