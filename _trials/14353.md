abstract: "Experts can be biased, a potential reason for the "crisis of expertise" we are experiencing. Yet it is unclear why bias should affect updating. Indeed, if the bias of an expert is well understood, a receiver could ``debias'' their message and recover a useful underlying signal. However, debiasing may be a cognitively complex process for individuals to undertake. We design a lab experiment to understand how the complexity of debiasing information affects its usage and valuation. "
