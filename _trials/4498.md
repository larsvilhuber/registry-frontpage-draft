abstract: "In this study we will unpack the effects of shocks on attendance at an income earning opportunity - participation in a paid lab study in Nairobi, Kenya. Specifically, we will test the effect of flexibility by increasing the range of dates available to attend to better understand the barriers affecting individuals ability to take part in an income earning opportunity. We will also elicit beliefs about how likely it is that a set of external shocks will affect attendance. "
