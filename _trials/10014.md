abstract: "The goal of the study is to analyze the effects of an internet-based recommender system that identifies establishments likely to hire apprentices in a geographical area of interest. Such a system is expected to improve the targeting of unsolicited applications, thereby enhancing the quality and number of matches between firms and candidates to apprenticeship programs. The system analyzed is a French website, La Bonne Alternance (LBA), rolled out by the French Public Employment Service (Pôle Emploi) in 2018. It is receiving in 2021 about 1.5 million visits per year and displays about 500.000 plants. It has received sizable attention in the public debate because of both its audience and the difficulties to foster high-quality apprenticeships in France. The experiment started in September 2021 and will run until the end of September 2022."
