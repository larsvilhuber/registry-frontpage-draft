abstract: "This project is a randomized controlled trial in Ethiopia that evaluates the impact of: a) the provision of Quality Protein Maize (QPM) seed and b) an intervention to target the consumption of QPM to infants and young children.  The trial consists of three randomly assigned groups: a control group, a treatment group in which households are given free QPM seed, and a treatment group in which households are given free QPM seed and female caregivers are given additional information about the benefits of QPM for children and receive a specially labeled container for earmarking QPM grain specifically for child consumption. Primary outcomes are child growth (height for age, weight for age and weight for height Z-scores), biomarkers of protein status, and child consumption of QPM. This study is novel in its recognition that adoption alone is not sufficient for agricultural technologies to improve nutrition for vulnerable children and thus evaluates simple interventions targeting key barriers along the pathway from adoption to nutrition.
