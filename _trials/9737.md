abstract: "Financial inclusion requires that individuals not only register for and have access to financial services, but also that they also learn how and use services available to them. It may not be trivial to get people to enroll in financial services, but then accounts must be used to include people in the financial system. This study examines whether conditional or unconditional transfers can be an effective way of boosting usage of digital financial services both among refugee and host populations. Partnering with a local service provider in areas hosting refugee camps in Jijiga and Dollo Ado, both in Somali region of Ethiopia, we plan to randomly offer two types of small incentives to relatively new customers who have not used the service after signing up for it. First, we will assign a group to receive an unconditional transfer, labeled to encourage experimentation, and a second group will be randomly assigned to receive a conditional transfer, triggered by first transacting three times within a month.  Both groups will be compared to a control group that is not offered incentives. "
