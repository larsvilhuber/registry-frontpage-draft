abstract: "The “Schooling Income and Health Risk” (SIHR) project is a randomized evaluation of a conditional/unconditional cash transfer intervention targeting young women in Malawi that provided incentives (in the form of school fees and cash transfers) to current schoolgirls and recent dropouts to stay in or return to school.  The program, known as the Zomba Cash Transfer Program (ZCTP), took place in Zomba, Malawi during 2008 and 2009.  The evaluation began with baseline data collection in late 2007, with the most recent round of data collection (Round 4) taking place in 2012-2013.   

The SIHR study includes four rounds of interviews with over 3,500 young women.  The data collection effort includes household surveys, individual quantitative and qualitative interviews, academic assessments, Voluntary Counseling and Testing, school surveys, market surveys, community surveys, and health facility assessments.

The SIHR project was specifically designed to answer a number of important questions about cash transfer programs for which we had little prior evidence. First, almost all that we know about the impacts of these programs come from Latin America, where income levels are much higher and institutional capacity is vastly superior compared with many poor countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Second, the evidence base to effectively choose program design parameters (such as conditionality, transfer size, and the specific identity of the program beneficiary within households) is severely limited.  Third, evidence on final outcomes, such as learning, labor market outcomes, and HIV risk is lacking. Finally, long term evaluations of cash transfer programs are rare – mainly because the control groups in these evaluations are treated after a short period of time.
