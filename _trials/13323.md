abstract: "This study is an update from our initial equal opportunity experiment. The initial equal opportunity experiment is now considered a pilot experiment.

Equal opportunity has wide applicability throughout society. It touches upon access to education, employment, legal representation, etc. Given that equal opportunity has different meanings to different people (i.e., equal opportunity in outcomes, resources, access, etc.), we use a simplified definition based on the different types of equal opportunity mentioned in Arneson (2018). We define equal opportunity to mean that individuals should have similar access to “resources” except when one’s innate ability leads to a difference in resource allocation. 

This project explores how economic inequality created by an institution affects productivity, and how productivity resulting from the institutional structure affects views on fairness and redistribution. We do this by setting up a controlled laboratory experiment in a two-person competitive environment consisting of a real-effort task where we vary the amount of time subjects have to perform the task. We use time as a resource in our competitive environment and we vary the amount of resources to compete under institutions that provide an advantage to subjects based on different inequality sources. More specifically we set up three inequality institutions that provide an advantage to the higher performer, the lower performer individual, or randomly to one of the individuals in the group. The control condition has the same amount of time for both participants. 

The pre-analysis plan includes details on the structure of the experiment and our empirical strategy."
