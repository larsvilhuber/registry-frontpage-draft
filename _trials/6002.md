abstract: "Refugee integration requires broad support from the host society, but only a minority of the host population is actively engaged. Given that most individuals reciprocate kind behavior, we examine the idea that the proportion of supporters will increase as a reciprocal response to refugees’ contributions to society through volunteering. We ran a nationwide survey experiment, a laboratory experiment and a natural field experiment (the latter is registered here). All data show that citizens’ intentions to contribute time and money as well as actual contributions rise significantly when they learn about refugees’ pro-social activities. "
