abstract: "We plan to test whether firms take government debt in the Eurozone into account when forming their inflation expectations. The fiscal theory of the price level suggests that economic agents believe that higher levels of government debt lead to higher inflation expectations since the monetary authority is also concerned with reducing the debt burden of the government. We plan to inform random subsets of German firms with different scenarios for the future path of government debt in France, Italy and Spain. Informing firms about non-German debt allows us to isolate the effect of higher debt levels through the monetary authority only since German firms are affected by ECB policy, but not directly by potential fiscal measures of the French, Italien and Spanish government."
