abstract: "Africa’s climate is warmer than it was 100 years ago and model-based predictions of future climate for the continent clearly suggest that this warming will continue and, in most scenarios, accelerate (Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change , 2018). Therefore, the study examines how various information on climate variability can encourage farmers to adopt long-term adaptation mechanisms such as irrigation and also be able to differentiate short-term and long term potential adaptation strategies. 

The study will be based on utility maximization theory where a representative farmer adopts a given climate variability adaptation mechanism that gives a higher net utility. In other words, a given farmer selects a climate change coping strategy given the relevant climate information based provided it gives him higher benefits. He or she compares among the strategies and selects the one with higher benefits. The study will take place in Machakos County, Kenya which is characterized by frequent occurrences of prolonged dry seasons, floods and landslides which adversely affect farming which is  the primary source of welfare for the majority Kenyans. The results of this research will inform climate policies and initiatives that support farmer’s livelihoods and sustainability in Kenya, and more broadly in East Africa.
