abstract: "The aim of this randomized field trial is to study the causal effect of SMS voting reminders on turnout of young voters in upcoming Finnish parliamentary elections together with dynamic effects of previously received voting reminders during the 2022 county elections SMS voting reminder trial. The turnout has been noticeably low among youth voters compared to older age groups in Finland. Thus, the target population of this intervention is from 18 to 30 years old individuals who are eligible to vote, living in municipalities with an electronic voting registry (i.e. the turnout is registered at the individual level) and having a cellular phone number. We are going to estimate whether SMS reminder received during the upcoming parliamentary elections will increase turnout and if SMS reminder received during the previous county elections affects the turnout in parliamentary elections and whether this effect differs if SMS reminder was received also during the parliamentary elections. The sample is randomized into control group which does not receive a reminder and into treatment group which receives a neutral reminder on election dates and urges to vote. Treatment group will receive an SMS before the advance voting period and another before the election day. Potential heterogeneous effects by predicted voting propensity, predicted left-right voting, voting area party support, previous voting participation, geographical area and socioeconomic status will be estimated. In addition to that we will explore spill over effects within the household, close by neighbourhood and workplace."
