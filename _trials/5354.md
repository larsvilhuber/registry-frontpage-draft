abstract: "We evaluate the impact of an intervention designed to reduce family planning provider bias towards young, unmarried, and nulliparous women in Tanzania, Burkina Faso, and Pakistan. The intervention has three components: 1) a summit that highlight the consequences of provider bias and instructions on how not to be biased, 2) a forum for continued communication between providers and implementation staff that reinforces the information from the summit, and 3) a rewards program where facilities in which providers exhibit less biased client interactions or who have improved the most towards this end are rewarded with social recognition and a ceremony. We randomized half of the eligible clinics in each country to receive the intervention and the other half to be a control group. We evaluate the impact of the intervention on a range of outcomes using four types of quantitative data: 1) provider surveys, 2) mystery client visits, 3) client exit surveys, and 4) service provision data routinely collected by the clinics. We report the impact of the intervention on providers’ biased attitudes and beliefs, family planning counseling, family planning methods dispensed, and client perceptions of family planning care. We contextualize our quantitative results with qualitative interviews with key stakeholders, managers, providers, and clients. The document outlines our general analysis plan. This document is in a “rough draft” format but nonetheless pre-specifies our main approach.  Some of the writing will be included verbatim in the final paper and thus is written in the past tense (even though most of the work has yet to be performed). "
