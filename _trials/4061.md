abstract: "Behavior in a group differs from behavior in solitude. What does it take to be a group? We study the weakest possible group effect, two persons who never meet and are anonymous to each other, but where one of them observes some of the actions of the other and where they have a joint interest as their payment depends on the performance of both. The question is whether the fact that the person is being observed, although anonymously, will affect their ability to self-control. Alternatively, the presence of a partner with shared interest, may affect self-control.
