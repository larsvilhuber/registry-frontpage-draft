abstract: "Society often punishes the offender after a transgression. This study examines whether and to what extent a victim's preference for punishment influences (third-party) decisions on how to punish the offender. We do so in an online lab setting, where the transgression and punishment are both monetary in nature. In a follow-up study, we investigate whether individuals believe third parties *should* consider the victim's preferences when deciding how to punish offenders."
