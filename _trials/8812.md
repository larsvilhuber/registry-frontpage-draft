abstract: "There is a growing and already robust literature on election monitoring internationally. This research focuses on how individuals perceive the work of election monitors through the prism of their social group and views toward international actors. In the US, election monitoring is an increasingly relevant though understudied topic. Using a randomized survey experiment conducted mong 600 US residents, this study explores the factors that lead citizens to more engagement in grassroots electoral monitoring and shape their views of the freeness and fairness of elections."
