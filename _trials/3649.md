abstract: "We study how different forms of communication can influence inflation expectations of individuals in a randomized controlled trial. We first solicit individualsâ€™ distribution of inflation expectations and provide eight different forms of information regarding inflation. We then study how these different types of information affect the beliefs of individuals over time relative to those in control groups that either receive no information or irrelevant information."
