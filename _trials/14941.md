abstract: "This study is designed to experimentally test the effect of two behavioral nudges – pledging to act civilly and public observability – on civility in online communications. In our study, online participants will provide responses to real statements sourced from online platforms on various topics, choosing from a list containing civil and uncivil responses that either agree or disagree with a given statement. Furthermore, we will randomize subjects into treatments where their responses would potentially be publicly viewed by others, while other subjects will be providing purely hypothetical responses. We will also collect subject beliefs, ideological leanings, and demographics to conduct heterogeneity analyses."
