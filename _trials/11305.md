abstract: "We describe the analysis plan for an online intervention designed to learn the historical views among different demographic groups in the US and to determine whether enquiring about these views has an effect on political attitudes and polarization. The study is a follow-up that builds on a previous round of data collection (AEARCTR-0009108), implementing the same methodology and asking similar questions from a different set of participants recruited through a different platform (Prolific). We will include new questions about the need to discuss historical and contemporary racial inequities in educational spaces, perceptions of racial inequities today, and agreement with historical narratives that were generated based on the previous round of data collection."
