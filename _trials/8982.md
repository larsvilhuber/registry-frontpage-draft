abstract: "This study contributes to the literature in behavioral economics and specifically on the role of preconceptions in dietary choices. We will conduct a small scale randomized controlled experiment and examine how people's valuations of a vegan food product depend on prior information about the nature of the product. Concretely, we will contrast conditions where participants have the opportunity to purchase a vegan product and vary (1) whether they can taste the product beforehand, (2) whether they are informed the product is vegan and (3) the timing of when they receive information about the nature of the product. This design will help us understand how preconceptions interfere with choices and with possible updating of beliefs and ultimately, possible behavioral change.
