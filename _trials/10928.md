abstract: "Studies found that mobile money transfer increases consumption and remittance by reducing time, transport, and transaction costs. Despite having enormous potential for unbanked and marginalized persons, mobile phone-based money and digital financing system remain low in developing countries. Using beneficiaries of the Ethiopian Safety Net program, largest in Africa, this study aims to test the efficiency of two interventions, i.e., Training and Financial Incentive, to promote uptake and use of mobile money and its intensive use and impacts for the poor and women. Identifying the relative efficacy of training and financial incentives for mobile money adoption is crucial for policy makers promoting financial inclusion of the poor in resource constrained settings of the developing world. Unlike most previous studies, this project does not take the uptake of mobile financial services for granted. In fact, adoption of MM remains the most challenging problem for financial inclusion among the poor. Results will also inform feasibility and identify modifications needed when designing follow-up large-scale RCT."
