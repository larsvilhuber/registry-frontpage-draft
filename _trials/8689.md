abstract: "Current food choices are unsustainable: most food products have social and environmental consequences that harm current and future generations worldwide. Recent studies analyzed the determinants driving sustainable food choices and experimentally tested ways to increase consumers’ willingness-to-pay for sustainability certifications. Thereby, evidence is scarce of how to reach the average consumer effectively. Insights into the potential of emotionally primed information - as commonly used in brand marketing and donation calls - suggest that the use of emotions serves as an efficient tool of mass communication by reaching the average consumer, not only a niche market. Thus, the effects of linking information to emotional priming on the greater valuation of sustainable products are not well understood. To answer whether emotional priming in information provision increases consumers’ valuation of sustainable foods, we conduct an online experiment with 3,500 German consumers. We randomly assign information treatments related to either (1) social responsibility or (2) environmental sustainability. Each information treatment is delivered (a) with an emotional primer and (b) without. Using a discrete choice experiment and random parameters multinomial logit models, we estimate the effects of emotional priming on consumers’ willingness-to-pay for sustainability attributes, by sustainability objectives and sustainability claims in the short-and medium-term. We contribute to the existing literature in three ways by considering long-term treatment effects, social and environmental sustainability, and different product alternatives. Our findings are relevant for policymakers, NGOs, and companies because it provides insights for social marketing campaigns to promote sustainable consumption patterns."
