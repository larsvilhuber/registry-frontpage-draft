abstract: "Immunization rates in developing countries are low and while incentive-based approaches have been  demonstrated to effectively increase take-up and completion rates of immunization, research and policy attention on the optimal design and delivery of small incentives is sparse. We propose to conduct a randomized control trial involving small conditional cash transfers (mCCTs) to determine the optimal CCT  amount (high versus low), schedule (flat versus increasing) and design (lottery versus sure payment) that would lead to the highest increase in immunization rates. Interactive Research and Development's digital immunization registry will be used to enroll and randomize the study participants and generate CCTs disbursed through a mobile money transfer platform and mobile credit top- ups. The three year study will be conducted in Karachi, Pakistan enrolling a sample of 11,200 children, 0-2 years of age. The study aims to provide evidence regarding the most cost-effective way to structure incentives in terms of size, schedule, and design; and address the challenge of delivering small incentives in a way that is inexpensive, logistically simple, and not subject to leakage.
