abstract: "In organizations, routine tasks are often associated with low promotability and considered as a barrier to completing tasks with higher priority. A common observation is that routine (non-routine) tasks are more often done by women (men) either because the routine tasks are more often assigned to women (demand driven) or women are more likely to volunteer to do such tasks (supply driven). We conduct an online experiment to study the demand side of task allocation by investigating managers’ decision in assigning routine and non-routine tasks and eliciting managers’ belief about workers’ performance.
