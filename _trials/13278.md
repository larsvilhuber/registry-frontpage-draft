abstract: "We will use a cluster randomized controlled trail to measure the effect of delivering oral rehydration salts (ORS) and zinc –– highly effective and WHO recommended treatments for child diarrhea –– to homes with children under the age of 5 years in Bauchi, Nigeria. Half of the 323 wards in Bauchi will be randomly assigned to receive the free deliveries and the other half will be the control group. We will collect data through household surveys continuously for 12 months following the deliveries. The primary outcome will be the probability that a diarrhea cases that occurred within 4 weeks of survey was treated with ORS. We will measure the average effect on ORS use over 6-months, over 12-months, and monthly. Results will be used to inform whether this intervention should be scaled-up nationwide and in other settings, and also how frequently deliveries should take place to maximize cost-effectiveness. "
