abstract: "It is long documented that small-scale farmers in Uganda under-adopt technologies like inorganic fertilizers despite their productivity advantages. A critical obstacle arises in how farmers learn about these technologies. Farmers frequently witness others’ impressive results with an agricultural technology, yet remain unconvinced that it will work as well for themselves. Indeed, simply copying others’ fertilizer practices may fail to replicate their success, as African soil and weather conditions vary quickly over small distances and affect fertilizer results. We consider a novel intervention in Eastern Uganda for helping farmers translate others’ fertilizer results to their own context, even if underlying conditions differ. In particular, we study whether providing mechanistic explanations of *why* fertilizers produce a particular result helps farmers deduce what, if anything, would change in a result for themselves, and tailor an observed practice accordingly."
