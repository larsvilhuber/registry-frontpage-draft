abstract: "How does the opportunity of international educational migration affect human capital investments in the country of origin? We inform high school students in Uganda about a new merit-based study-abroad program and analyze how the experimentally induced changes in knowledge about the opportunity to study abroad shape their human capital investments. The Malengo program (www.malengo.org) offers mentoring and financial support to young adults in Uganda who want to complete a university degree in Germany and could not otherwise afford to study at a university. Acceptance to the program combines the returns to higher education with the returns to migration and thus offers a life-changing opportunity. To be eligible, applicants must obtain a sufficiently high score in the high-stakes Uganda Advanced Certificate of Education (UACE) examination. Our primary research question is whether and how educational migration prospects lead to increased human capital investments amongst students who eventually go abroad as well as those who remain in Uganda."
