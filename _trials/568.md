abstract: "Although extrinsic and intrinsic motivation likely jointly explain the effort of many agents engaged in public service delivery, incentives typically only appeal to the former. In the context of a maternal health program in rural Uttar Pradesh, India, we develop a novel, mobile phone-based "intrinsic incentive" technology designed to increase health workers' intrinsic returns to effort. In a randomized field experiment, we test one version designed to have a larger effect on intrinsic utility against another designed to be less powerful. A one-year pilot experiment (March 2013 to February 2014) reveals the following findings. First, demand for both technologies is high; the average user accesses her software application approximately once every days for the duration of the one-year experiment. Second, average treatment effects are nil. Third, the high-powered intrinsic incentive is most effective when it leverages pre-existing intrinsic motivation; it produces a 38.4% increase in performance in the top tercile of intrinsically motivated workers. Finally, this effect appears to be mediated purely by making effort more intrinsically rewarding, and not by other mechanisms such as providing implicit extrinsic incentives.

Based on these hypothesis-generating findings, we conduct a replication experiment as an out-of-sample test in an adjoining population of health workers."
