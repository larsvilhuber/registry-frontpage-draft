abstract: "The number of migrants moving from one country to another is bound to increase, and a considerable fraction of these flows will try to access the European countries. At the same time, public opinion towards immigration is often negative. A supportive public approach has many advantages, as it can facilitate an efficient management of the migration flows and improve the integration of migrants in our societies. Building on a theoretical model, we study a set of experimental treatments aimed at promoting support to immigration through a mechanism based on social norms. Our intervention consists of presenting a favourable social norm prevailing among the members of an "ingroup" (the natives) and test its effectiveness in reducing the social distance between a subject belonging to the ingroup and the "outgroup" (the migrants). Receiving a favourable social norm is expected to deliver a clear sign that peers of the ingroup are not against migrants, ultimately affecting behaviour."
