abstract: "Achieving high-quality Early Childhood Education (ECE) is a critical education goal in developing countries. The use of play-based learning can improve the quality of ECE. This study aims at evaluating the impact of play-based learning and ECE workforce development at the pre-primary school level on the school readiness of preschool children. The study targets children in structured public Early Childhood Development (ECD) centres in The Gambia. Eligible schools will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: a treatment group that will be introduced to a new played-based curriculum and receive in-service teacher training on the new curriculum and a comparison group that will not receive any of the two packages. To evaluate the impact of the intervention, the study will collect baseline and endline data. The evaluation will cover 100 schools, while 50 of the schools will be assigned to each group. The primary outcome of interest will be children's learning outcomes as well as the ability of facilitators to use play-based pedagogies. Therefore, the study will contribute to existing but scanty literature on the impacts of play-based learning interventions in developing countries, particularly in Africa. Moreover, it will contribute to filling the knowledge gap on workforce development and early childhood development. "
