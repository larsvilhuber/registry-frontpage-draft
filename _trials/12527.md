abstract: "The arrival of ChatGPT marks the era of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), in which intelligent algorithms create new text, images, and other media. ChatGPT is predicted to boost productivity in several occupations (Eloundou et al., 2023), especially among workers with less expertise in the exposed occupations (Noy & Zhang, 2023).

This project asks three questions: Which workers have adopted ChatGPT? What do workers believe about the capabilities of ChatGPT in their job tasks? Do worker beliefs about the capabilities of ChatGPT determine their adoption? 

To answer these questions, we conduct a survey with an embedded randomized treatment among Danish workers in 11 occupations exposed to ChatGPT. We link the survey to registry data on the characteristics and outcomes of workers, including their occupation, skill, experience, workplace, and earnings, among others. We build the survey around the task model of technology adoption (Acemoglu & Autor, 2011) and use the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) database to identify the relevant job tasks for each occupation. 

We conduct a main survey and a follow-up.

The main survey is organized into five parts. First, we ask workers about their experiences with ChatGPT in their job tasks. We also ask about the importance of these tasks for workers and their expertise in the tasks. Second, we elicit workers' beliefs about the productivity and expertise-complementarity of ChatGPT in their job tasks. Third, we expose our treatment groups to expert assessments of the capabilities of ChatGPT (productivity and expertise-complementarity) in the job tasks. Fourth, we ask workers about their intended use of ChatGPT in their job tasks. We also allow workers to receive additional information on ChatGPT in their occupations.  Finally, we ask workers about their beliefs about the productivity of ChatGPT in their own jobs, together with any misalignments in their stated beliefs and intended behaviors.

We conduct a follow-up survey two weeks after the workers' response to the main survey. The follow-up measures whether workers' beliefs persist over time and if workers' intended adoption translates into the actual use of ChatGPT.

We randomize the sampling and treatment by workers and workplaces. The adoption study described in the analysis plan focuses on the worker-level experiment."
