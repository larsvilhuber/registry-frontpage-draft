abstract: "In today’s fast-changing job market, driven by technological advancements and economic shifts, it is more important than ever for people to update their skills throughout their careers. However, many individuals don’t take part in lifelong learning and training, even though it can increase their earnings and improve their overall quality of life. This research aims to understand whether the way labor market information is framed can motivate people to engage in work-related training. We focus on two types of messages: one highlights the benefits of training (gain framing), and the other emphasizes the consequences of not training (loss framing). Using an online information experiment with 1,200 Dutch-speaking participants, we examine how these messages impact people’s emotions (like hope and fear), beliefs, expectations, as well as their attitudes toward training and training behavior. We also explore how personal characteristics—like time and risk preferences, loss aversion, procrastination and self-efficacy - might shape how people respond to these messages. "
