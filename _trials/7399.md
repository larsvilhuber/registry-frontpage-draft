abstract: "In this experiment, we study the extent to which information about the benefits and costs of public vocational training programs in Buenos Aires affect enrollment and dropout. We elicit expectations from prospective students just prior to enrollment about future wages, employment, and study hours. We then provide a random subset of students with the option to purchase information about either the benefits or costs of the program using a BDM mechanism. Finally, we provide the information and collect their posteriors conditional on purchase. Using administrative records from participating schools, we test the hypothesis that better-informed participants are less likely to dropout conditional on enrollment. We explore stigma in seeking information about the challenges of a career path as an explanation for existing informational asymmetries"
