abstract: "We randomize different resources among participants to an acceleration program and follow the ventures bi-weekly during the program. Specifically, we randomize access to knowledge resources (training, mentoring, peer-interactions), and financial resources (eg. grants) in two treatment groups. One group gets access to both knowledge and financial resources, the second group access only knowledge resources and then there is the comparison group that does not access any resources. "
