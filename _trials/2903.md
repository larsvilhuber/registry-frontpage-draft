abstract: "The project aims to use experimental evidence to investigate the relationship between personality type, beliefs about others’ type (sometimes called “theory of mind”) and performance in a series of tasks. The tasks include strategic guessing games where subjects need to guess what their partners will do in advance, and games which involve an element of cooperation. Other tasks include demographic questionnaires, IQ tests, and other psychometric tests."
