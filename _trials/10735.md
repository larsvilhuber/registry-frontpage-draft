abstract: "We study the effects of monetary policy on aggregate consumption combining a heterogeneous agent model with measured expectations under different policy counterfactuals. We express the consumption of non-hand-to-mouth households as a function of expectations only and elicit all expectations appearing in the consumption functions for alternative monetary policy scenarios with tailored surveys. Feeding these
individual-level expectations into the model illustrates that a modest forward guidance statement in March 2021 would have reduced aggregate consumption by 0.14% on impact and an interest rate hike of 40 basis points in March 2022 would have reduced aggregate consumption by 0.30% on impact."
