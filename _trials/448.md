abstract: "This paper tests whether adding flood tolerance to the farmer's production technology -- thus sharply reducing risk -- leads to agricultural investment. Specifically, we study Swarna-Sub1, which is one of the first stress-tolerant rice varieties to be released in south Asia. Other than enhanced flood tolerance, Swarna-Sub1 is genetically very similar to the popular rice variety Swarna. 

We use a randomized experiment across 128 villages in the Bhadrak and Balasore districts of Odisha India. 5 farmers in each treatment village were provided a small amount of Swarna-Sub1 seed. Two years of follow-up surveys were conducted. "
