abstract: "Previous studies show a gender difference in wage negotiation behavior which may explain part of the gender wage gap. However, how to close this negotiation gap and its link to the gender wage gap remains unclear. This project aims to produce causal evidence on the means to encourage negotiation behavior among graduates (particularly female graduates), i.e., which instruments are effective to incentivize women to negotiate more, and whether increasing negotiation reduces the gender wage gap. I will randomly assign German master students into an information treatment, a role model treatment and a control group. I will also cross-randomize all groups with a negotiation training invitation. The information treatment includes information on gender differences in negotiation and wages while the role model treatment contains personalized information on negotiation experiences conveyed by successful role models. The negotiation training treatment includes five negotiation training videos prepared by an expert in this field. 

I will implement an online randomized field experiment with master students before graduation and use an online survey to follow them at labor market entry after graduation. In addition to the follow-up survey, linking the collected data with the register employment data from the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) will allow me to observe the realized gender wage gap among the graduates, as well as additional employment and firm characteristics. With the questionnaire implemented in the first wave of the field experiment, I aim to ask detailed questions on negotiation behavior, salary and job search expectations, and personality traits. The follow-up survey in the second wave will reveal which treatment has the strongest impact on the negotiation behavior of women in a first job interview after graduation, and consequently, on decreasing the gender wage gap. Furthermore, the administrative data of the linked dataset will allow me to observe the long-run effects of negotiation on the labor market outcomes of graduates.
