abstract: "Recent randomized control trial studies find little or no effect of microcredit on investments in education or health, or on women’s decision-making power (Banerjee et. al 2016). In contrast, Pitt et al (2003) and Pitt, Khandker and Cartwright (2006), in examining non-random access to microcredit in Bangladesh in the 1990s, do find that credit provided to women helps to increase women’s empowerment, reduces malnutrition in children, and has large positive effects on relative changes in children’s health. They find credit provided to men has no significant effect. However, these studies use structural estimation techniques to identify effects. Given the non-experimental nature of these studies, questions have been raised about the robustness of the findings (Roodman and Morduch 2009; Duvendack and Palmer-Jones 2012; Roodman and Morduch 2014). An important question is whether the difference in findings is due to the short run nature of recent experimental field studies compared with the Bangladeshi study, the specifics of Bangladesh versus other locations, or the difference in identification strategies (Roodman and Morduch 2014). This project seeks to address this question by collecting follow-up data on a clustered randomized control trial of a credit program targeted towards farm microenterprises in Bangladesh, successfully implemented by BRAC in 2012. This follow-up study will be conducted in coordination with BRAC. It will allow us to measure the long run impact of women’s access to microcredit on health and educational investment, health-related outcomes of women and children, and on three different aspects of women’s empowerment–economic, demographic and psychological. This project will contribute to understanding the important issue of the linkage between women’s access to credit and improvements in health and educational outcomes, and women’s empowerment. Most importantly, the collaboration with a development agency involved in the actual implementation of development policies will imply an immediate integration of research results into policy guidelines and development programs.
