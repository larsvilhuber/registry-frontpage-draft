abstract: "The randomized field experiment involves twelve donation centers of the Belgian Red Cross-Flanders to study the impact of information provision and extra rewards for plasma donations. As a normal practice, donors receive one thank-you coupon (worth $1.5) for a blood donation and two coupons for a plasma donation. Those rewards are not mentioned in the monthly newsletter. In the experiment, the donation centers are randomly allocated to three groups: four are allocated to a control group, four to the information treatment group and the remaining four to the reward treatment group. For a period of nine months (the information period) the monthly newsletter of the information and reward group donation centers explicitly mention the rewards for blood and plasma donations. During six of those nine months (the reward period), donors at donation centers of the reward group receive an extra reward for plasma donations (i.e. three instead of two coupons). The hypotheses to be tested are: does informing donors about the rewards influence their donation rates? Does the extra reward for plasma donation increases the plasma donation rate? Is there a shift from blood to plasma donations when plasma donors receive an extra reward? Do donors change the timing or location of their donations when some donation centers give more rewards for plasma donation during some periods?
