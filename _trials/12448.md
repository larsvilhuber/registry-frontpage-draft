abstract: "We study the role of communication on productivity in a company. We introduce a communication-facilitating app to the employees in the company. The app provides each employee's detailed profile and skill sets at a glance, improving "who knows what" within the company. In addition, a part of the employees will be offered matching services and interventions to encourage conversations with employees in other departments. By examining the facilitated communications with previously unknown employees by the app and matching service and the change in productivity, we examine the impact of communications on productivity.
