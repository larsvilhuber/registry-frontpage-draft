abstract: "This project aims to understand the impact of incidental sadness on strategic interactions between individuals. We started to explore the impact of emotions, and in particular anger, on strategic interactions in a previous experiment (AEARCTR-0004267). This previous experiment was motivated by recent literature that suggests that anger is a commitment device that leads individuals to ignore or switch-off the capacity of forming higher order beliefs (e.g. Frank [1987], Meshulam et al. [2012], Van Leeuwen et al. [2017]). Our experimental findings show a significant and negative impact of being angry on strategic play.

As a result of these findings, our goal in this project is to understand whether the negative impact of anger on strategic play is unique to being angry as the above mentioned literature suggests or if it is a general effect of negative emotions. Thus, in this project our goal is to run the same experiment as in AEARCTR-0004267, with the unique difference that we will induce sadness instead of anger. This will allow us to understand whether being sad affects strategic play and performance in a repeated beauty contest game as compared to the control condition (no emotion induced). And, also, it will allow us to compare the results with the previous in order to draw inferences regarding the differential impact of anger and sadness on strategic play.
