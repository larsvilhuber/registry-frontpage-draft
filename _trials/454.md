abstract: "The Child Development Grants Programme (CGDP) will pilot a cash transfer programme that will focus on removing the food security and financial barriers to improving nutrition. The programme will operate in rural areas of two states in Nigeria: Jigawa and Zamfara.

By providing cash to poor women, it is expected that the programme will enable them to buy more and better quality food and also to spend money on education and health. The project, which will be implemented by Save the Children (SC) and Action Against Hunger (ACF) will provide a child development grant (CDG) of approximately 3,500 Naira (Â£14) a month to mothers, from the time they are confirmed to be pregnant until the child is two years old.

The design of the evaluation is such that there will be a control group, a first treatment group of mothers that receive the unconditional cash grant plus basic, "low intensity" nutritional education and advice to mothers, and in another treatment arm this unconditional cash transfer will be supplemented by the provision of "high intensity" nutritional education and advice to mothers.
