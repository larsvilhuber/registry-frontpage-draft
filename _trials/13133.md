abstract: "Behavioral interventions often focus on reducing friction to encourage behavior change. 

The intention for our study is to provide evidence for a 'Buy-In Effect.' We test whether adding friction upfront in a sign-up process encourages buy-in and behavioral follow-through among employees who sign-up for a carpool program. Research in behavioral economics has shown that automatically enrolling people into programs can have positive effects on outcomes (e.g., Beshears, Choi, Laibson, & Madrian, 2010). However, these studies have largely shown benefits in settings where the outcome is a natural and automatic consequence of the policy: for example, in the automatic enrollment work on retirement savings, the outcome policymakers are looking for is larger retirement savings, which happens automatically when people are opted into these accounts (Madrian and Shea, 2001). 

In this project, however, we study a program whereby people have to use deliberate effort to continuously engage with the service after initial enrollment. Policymakers in this setting therefore hope that participants engage with the carpool program and actively use the tool after they are initially registered, but this decision requires continuous active and engaged effort on behalf of participants themselves. 

In this setting, we hypothesize that there might be a 'buy-in effect', where people are more engaged with the tool when theyâ€™ve made the active choice to opt in, even if they would have opted in anyway in the absence of automatic enrollment. This may mean that it would be more effective to actively recruit people to take up the tool rather than having them passively enrolled, and would have important consequences for behaviorally informed interventions in similar contexts. 

We collaborate with the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) to test whether adding friction during an initial sign-up process for a new carpool platform increases usage and follow-through. We design two versions of an email being sent to previously inactive users of ODOT's old carpool platform, with the first version ('More Effort') involving additional friction in the sign-up process in the form of more steps to create one's account on the new carpool platform, and the second version ('Less Effort') simply involving individuals having to create a new password in order to access their account on the new carpool platform. 

To evaluate the impact of the intervention on participant follow-through, we conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT). We test for evidence of the buy-in effect by measuring three outcomes related to participants' follow-through: (1) number of carpool platform sign-ups, (2) number of trips logged on the carpool platform, and (3) number of miles logged on the carpool platform.
