abstract: "Given that insects provide high-quality animal protein that can be produced in an environmentally sustainable manner, there is an increasing interest in farming them to satisfy the growing demand for nutritious and sustainable foods. This is especially relevant in low-income countries, where insect farming can enhance livelihoods by improving dietary diversity and quality, generating cash income, and creating employment opportunities. While new farming systems are being developed and tested, there is a lack of knowledge on the drivers of successful insect farming and the impacts of this practice. This, in turn, hinder the development of appropriate policies for realizing its full potential for sustainable development. The current study aims to fill this knowledge gap by investigating the effectiveness of educational interventions in promoting insect farming for household consumption in three African countries. The study is designed as a multi-site randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impacts of agricultural training alone or in combination with nutrition education on the adoption of insect farming. In each of the three countries, ninety-nine villages will be randomly assigned to one of three arms: two treatment groups or a control group. Focusing on production (P), the first treatment covers agricultural training on insect farming and the provision of insect production starter kits. Focusing on both production and consumption (PC), the second treatment involves the same intervention components as treatment P plus additional nutrition education and insect food preparation demonstrations. The impacts of the intervention will be measured through two primary outcome variables indicating the adoption of insect farming and consumption of the farmed insects in the households. "
