abstract: "Many countries in the developing world have implemented non-contributory old-age pensions, however, evidence of the impacts of this policy on the elderly in Sub-Saharan Africa is scarce. This paper provides evidence from a randomized evaluation of an unconditional, non-contributory pension scheme targeted at the elderly in Ekiti State, Nigeria. This project stems from the local government which sought to improve the wellbeing of this group. Our goal is to examine the extent to which such a program can serve as an instrument to improve the wellbeing of elderly citizens. We collected data from 6,067 eligible beneficiaries across 112 electoral wards in Ekiti State. The randomization of beneficiaries was done at the ward level, where 3,230 beneficiaries were eligible to receive an unconditional cash transfer and 3,096 individuals were studied as controls. Our findings suggest that the treated beneficiaries self-reported better quality of life, a more stable mental health,  and better health status. We also provide evidence of spillover effects on the labor outcomes and on the household expenditure patterns. This paper provides evidence-based support for demand side interventions aimed at improving the welfare of elderly poor citizens and other households members."
