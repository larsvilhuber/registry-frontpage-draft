abstract: "We experimentally investigate the effects of providing franchisees with the opportunity to hire the services of a "floater" who can be booked at short notice in order to replace absent regular workers. The floater scheme is motivated by results from a survey showing that the incidence of absence among specific types of regular employees may lead to discriminatory hiring decisions. We will measure the effects of the floater scheme on several shop- and employee-level outcomes, such as hiring demographics, personnel planning (i.e., organizational slack), employee attitudes towards their job, colleagues and managers, and employee turnover.
