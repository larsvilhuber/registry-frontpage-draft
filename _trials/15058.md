abstract: "Our study aims at investigating public views of the role of universities in society. Specifically, we are interested in gauging perceptions of the role of universities beyond their core mission of education and research and in relation to societal issues such as environmental sustainability, DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) and free speech. We are interested in comparing how views differ across demographic groups (split according to gender, education level and political orientation) and in comparing the perceived role of universities relative to private corporations. We will conduct a study on Prolific with a representative sample of 2,000 respondents: 1,500 will answer a survey focusing on universities and 500 will answer a survey focused on corporations. Views will be elicited using non-incentivized questions (for both samples) and incentivized questions (Universities only). "
