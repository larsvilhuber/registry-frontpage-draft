abstract: "Motivated by studying how the spread of fake news may affect peopleâ€™s opinions, we propose an experiment to explore how a decision maker would update her belief under an ambiguous and asymmetric information structure. Specifically, we study individual belief updating in an environment with two possible states (B and R) and a binary signal (b or r), which can be either true news or fake news. The true news and fake news are characterized by its accuracy and bias, respectively. If the signal is true news, it reports the realized state with probability equal to its accuracy. Otherwise, the signal is non-informative and indicates state R with probability equal to its bias regardless of the true state. When ambiguity is present, a decision maker only knows that the chance of receiving fake news falls in a range between 0 and 1. In other words, the exact pervasiveness of fake news is unknown to a decision maker. By comparing with belief updating behavior in the absence of ambiguity, we hope our experimental findings can shed light on the impact of fake news on individual belief formation and contribute to the literature on ambiguity attitude."
