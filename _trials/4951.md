abstract: "We hypothesize that more transparency about the sources and use of public funds helps voters make better judgements about their elected officials, making them more likely to vote in order to effect political change. We examine the effect of information on voter behavior by randomizing whether we provide a municipality's journalists, community leaders, and the general public with simple and accessible information about local public finance collected by the central government."
