abstract: "We investigate whether mindfulness meditation may improve academic performance. Among subjects at a university who indicated that they are interested in participating in a meditation course it is randomly determined who gets a place in the course and who does not. The course consists of eight weekly group sessions with an experienced meditation teacher and daily individual exercises. Pre and post intervention grade information from the universityâ€™s administrative records will be used to investigate whether the intervention improves academic performance.  Pre and post intervention questionnaires allow us to additionally investigate channels (stress, mindfulness, mental health, cognitive and non-cognitive skills, study behavior, and health behavior) through which the intervention may affect grades.
