abstract: "Credit constraints have been a classic explanation for why businesses in the developing world have struggled to grow, but relieving those constraints through microloans has had modest impacts on business outcomes. It may be that microloans are just too small to make an economically significant impact on business outcomes. We test this hypothesis using an experiment in Egypt where treatment firms receive a loan 4 times the size of their previous loan. "
