abstract: "This field experiment aims to assess the impact of interventions targeting psychological barriers on increasing the uptake of an EdTech program in both the short and long term. Specifically, by introducing a self-directed language learning digital product, to Grade 7 and 8 English teachers and students in a rural county in southeast China, the study seeks to evaluate participants' daily usage and academic performance. The experimental design involves a 2x2 cross-randomization, incorporating varied, repeated, and relationship-centered behavioral interventions. 

Specifically, In collaboration with the local Bureau of Education, the program introduces a free online learning platform, as a supplementary tool for English language learning alongside regular instruction. Participants include all Grade 7 and 8 teachers and students across the county, involving approximately 140 teachers and 14,000 students."
