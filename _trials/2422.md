abstract: "The aim of the study is to test the impact of behavioural economics-informed reminders on the credit card repayment behaviour of individuals who have persistently been making low repayments. Providing electronic notifications and proactively contacting consumers who persistently make small repayments were specifically actions proposed for behavioural testing in the Australian Government’s consultation paper titled ‘Credit Cards: Improving Consumer Outcomes and Enhancing Competition’. It is thought that consumers who make small repayments are experiencing financial hardship and/or are unaware of the consequences of under repayment and the options available to pay off debt more quickly."
