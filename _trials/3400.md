abstract: "Improved cookstoves (ICS) have the potential to deliver the triple dividends of household health and time savings, local environmental quality improvements, and reduced impacts on climate. However, despite clear scientific evidence on the potential efficacy of these innovations, these technologies have run into important translation challenges that have impeded their widespread diffusion and dissemination. Our project – Designing and Evaluating Behavior Change Interventions to Improve the Adoption and Use of Improved Cookstoves – was developed in response to a refrain of calls for applied research to develop a more refined understanding of the nature of these challenges. The logic underlying our research approach (described in greater detail below) stemmed from a perceived need to better understand the complex web of issues that constitute barriers to adoption of ICS and similar technologies (Pattanayak and Pfaff 2009), through careful background research and field preparation, followed by a study design that would enable rigorous hypothesis testing of supply and demand barriers to ICS adoption."
