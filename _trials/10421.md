abstract: "The objective of this project is to study the impact of health cost beliefs regarding soda consumption on policy preferences and support for health education. Moreover, we study whether individuals have motivated health-cost beliefs. To do that, we use a longitudinal survey experiment with two waves. In the first wave, we elicit beliefs about the weight implications of soda consumption. A random subgroup of participants receives information on the true health costs. Afterward, we elicit preferences for different policies that either improve nutritional information or provide commitment. Moreover, we investigate their willingness to donate to an NGO working on nutritional education. In the second wave, we elicit their health cost beliefs again and study whether individuals recollect the information in a motivated way (by studying whether recall depends on having a motive for incorrect beliefs). Moreover, we ask again for their policy preferences to study the long-run effects of information provision."
