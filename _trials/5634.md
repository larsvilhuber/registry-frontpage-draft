abstract: "This study investigates how counterstereotypical behavior affects the public beliefs about, first, career-related personality traits and, second, expertise in gender-stereotypical fields. The experiment elicits stereotypes of an individuals' personality and expertise: Subjects are presented a description about a (theoretical) person who is featured as either exhibiting stereotypical (assertive man or unassertive woman) or counterstereotypical (unassertive man or assertive woman) behavior. Then, they are asked to rate this personâ€™s personality traits and expertise in various gender-specific categories on a seven-point scale. Subjects are thereby incentivized to not reveal their own belief but to correctly anticipate the modal response of beliefs reported by others."
