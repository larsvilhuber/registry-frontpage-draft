abstract: "Over the past decade, a growing body of evidence has established the impact of neighborhood capital and pollution exposures on long-run economic outcomes, which elevates concern about whether certain groups are systematically disadvantaged by discriminatory steering into neighborhoods with greater challenges.  Paired-tester audit experiments have revealed evidence of discrimination in the interactions between potential renters and property managers.  This experiment evaluate the effects of discriminatory behavior in the rental housing market on the locational choice sets of renters in major markets of the United States.  We will estimate the welfare effect of discrimination through discriminatory constraints on housing search, combining structurally estimated utility functions with experimental tests for differences in responses to inquiries on a widely-used online platform"
