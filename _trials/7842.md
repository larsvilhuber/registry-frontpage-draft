abstract: "With the passage of the American Rescue Plan (ARP) in March 2021, more consumers than ever before are now eligible for free health insurance coverage across the ACA Marketplaces. But many individuals may not be aware of the new subsidies, or of their eligibility for Cost-Sharing Reduction (CSR) Silver plans. This project's goal is to examine the effects of personalized letters and email reminders. "
