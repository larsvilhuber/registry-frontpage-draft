abstract: "Transitioning away from carbon-intensive to more renewable energy sources is one key lever through which countries can mitigate climate change. At the same time, such energy transitions create losers among consumers, investors and workers. In this study, we conduct three survey experiments designed to test how compensation measures offered by the government change public support for a transition to greener energy sources. The survey is fielded in Germany, just before the 2021 federal election."
