abstract: "This project tests two interventions to reduce information asymmetries in the low/medium-skill sector of the South African labor market. We invite unemployed youths, who registered with the South African Department of Labour, to one of two treatments: i) participants complete an aptitude test in English and Math and receive a certificates with the result, ii) provide job seekers with a reference letter template and encourage them to have it filled out by a previous employer.
