abstract: "we conduct a field experiment to study whether people are affected by projection bias when making decisions about charitable donations. We find that respondentsâ€™  willingness to give  for environmental charities is affected by daily air pollution level.  We try to test  the importance of projection bias in understanding the altruistic behavior."
