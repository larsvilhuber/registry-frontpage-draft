abstract: "The delegation of power by firms to managers is common among hierarchically structured organisations. However, power can be abused by managers for their own self-interest to the detriment of subordinates and firms. Using an online randomised controlled experiment, we will analyse whether training affects the incidence of abuse of power by the manager, and whether this depends on the level of power. "
