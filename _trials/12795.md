abstract: "This project evaluates the impact of community-based cash transfers on household welfare in conflict affected and fragile settings. We aim to address the following important questions: (1) Can Community-Based cash transfers improve food security and subjective well-being of beneficiaries in conflict-affected settings? (ii) Can relatively small community-based cash transfers improve mental health and stress in the face of recurrent conflicts? (iii) Do welfare impacts of community-based cash transfers vary by how they are targeted? (iv) Are community-based transfers more impactful for improving welfare outcomes in conflict affected communities? (v) What is the impact of community-based cash transfers on trust in local governance and social cohesion in the presence and absence of conflicts? To address these questions, we design a cluster-based Randomized Control Trial (RCT) and randomly assign communities into control group and community-based cash transfers involving different targeting approaches.
