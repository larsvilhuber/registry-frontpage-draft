abstract: "Female labor force participation is low and falling in India. This pattern is concerning given the growing evidence that jobs empower women, and the particular need for such empowerment in India, where norms of patrilocality, patrilineality and dowry contribute to pervasive under-investment in women. In this project we explore two sides of the story, with a two-stage experiment. For both, we partner with a large carpet manufacturing firm that is recruiting rural women for weaving positions in a region where weaving is a male-dominated activity. We hypothesise that men often control the decisions of their wives, preventing them from enrolling against their wishes. In the first stage of our experiment, we explore whether enrollment decisions are affected by whether the husband or wife is directly canvassed, and in turn whether this is affected by amount of information known by the "non-canvassed" spouse. In the second stage, we randomise which women get positions amongst those that enroll. This way, we can also explore the effect of the job on longer-run income, labor supply and empowerment.
