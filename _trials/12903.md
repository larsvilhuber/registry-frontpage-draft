abstract: "Financial knowledge, financial attitude and financial behaviour, especially amongst school going children, is quite low in India. Using a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) design, we propose to measure the efficacy of a financial knowledge training programme in addressing the problem. We propose to train children in Kerala by engaging them in activities and participatory theatre. If found effective, this intervention can easily be scaled up for implementation as a policy to improve financial knowledge, financial attitude and financial behaviour among school going children.
