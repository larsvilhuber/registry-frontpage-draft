abstract: "We run an experiment to investigate whether German journalists have a home country bias when covering a global issue, namely, environmental performance. In the experiment, they generate headlines that make comparisons between either Germany and 10 other countries or France and 10 other countries. We additionally vary the audience of the headline, either German readers or French readers. Participants choose the comparison countries from a list containing a performance ranking in three different environmental metrics. We will compare the countries chosen across the treatments to document the extent of the bias as well as to test whether the bias is demand driven."
