abstract: "The Anchor Farm Model (AFM) of Clinton Development Initiatives (CDI) was established in 2008, and is designed to increase agricultural production, income and food security through promotion of the adoption of yield-enhancing integrated soil fertility management practices (ISFM) - and soybean production in particular - by smallholder farmers in central Malawi. To reach this goal, CDI disseminates production knowledge and improves farmers’ access to markets and storage. In this research study, we use the random assignment of 250 villages into various treatment arms to establish the impacts of these interventions on farmers’ welfare. Using detailed panel data, we identify the channels through which impacts take place and explore heterogeneity across households. The latter allows us to draw lessons for SSA with the goal of increase ISFM adoption across the continent.     "
