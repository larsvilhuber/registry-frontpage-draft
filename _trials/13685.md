abstract: "This project studies the causal impact of field days and text reminders on farmer engagement with personalized information campaigns delivered through digital means, farmer knowledge, the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices, and agricultural productivity. The empirical strategy of the study consists of a field experiment involving 944 palm farmers in the Orellana and Sucumbios provinces of the Ecuadorian Amazon. The experiment envisages enrolling participants in a messaging service delivering personalized informational campaigns about best practices in palm agriculture called SATagro across 4 topics: palm nursery and sustainable farming, pollination, fertilization, and integral pest management. The experiment assigns farmers into control, one of two treatments, or their combination using a factorial or "2X2" design. The first treatment is a series of field days involving (1) classroom learning and live demonstrations of each campaign's recommended agricultural practices and (2) tutorials explaining how to use the WhatsApp messaging service to interact with the messaging campaigns. The second treatment consists of an anticipatory WhatsApp nudge for each campaign, designed using insights from the behavioral economics literature to draw the attention of farmers to the messaging service."
