abstract: "Upon parturition or calving, due to increased milk production in dairy cows and buffaloes, calcium (Ca) requirement will be 10 times more than the dry period. If this requirement is not fulfilled, Ca deficiency leads to a condition called parturient hypocalcaemia or milk fever. It is an economically important disease; in Tamil Nadu alone the economic loss was estimated at ₹ 40.62 crores (Thirunavukkarasu, et al., 2010). Milk fever incidence in the field ranges from 5 - 25 per cent and in extreme cases may reach upto 80 per cent which results in huge losses to the dairy farmers (DeGaris & Lean, 2009). Supplementing negatively charged (anionic) ration before 3 weeks of calving reduces the incidence of milk fever and other diseases by increasing Ca resorption from the bones (Mani, 2018). With this background the proposed study evaluates the effectiveness of a technology commercialized by ICAR-NDRI namely ‘Anionic Mineral Mixture for reducing post-partum problems in cows and buffaloes’ using Randomized Control Trial (RCT) in the five adopted villages of NDRI.
Objectives
1. To evaluate the impact of anionic mineral mixture supplementation on milk production, incidence of milk fever and farmers’ income
2. To estimate the price sensitivity (demand elasticity) of the technology
3. To estimate the cost effectiveness and forecast the overall economic benefit of Anionic Mineral Mixture supplementation
