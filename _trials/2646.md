abstract: "The overall aim of the experiment is to test the impact of self-and social image concerns on the likelihood that firms participate in a voluntary carbon offsetting program as an example for a public good. Though public good provision of firms can be observed empirically (e.g. CSR measures), little is known about the different motivations and the mechanics behind it. We contribute to the literature by implementing an experimental setting that provides the sender of a delivery the opportunity to offset the carbon emissions of this service by paying a price premium, while we vary the opportunity to signal this pro-environmental behavior to the recipient of the delivery.
In a second phase, we extend the field experimental setting by introducing a 1:1 matching scheme to learn more about the firmsâ€™ evaluation of the signal. The matching doubles the amount of emissions offset while the price for the participant stays the same, if she decides to offset with a sticker attached to her delivery."
