abstract: "Resolving disputes is integral to the accumulation of state capacity. Yet often policymakers privilege ﬁscal capacity building in fragile states over legal capacity building. In this project, we study a low-capacity state—the D.R. Congo—seeking to establish legal authority and how its eﬀorts to do so shape citizens’ demand for the state. Speciﬁcally, we examine the randomized rollout of a legal capacity building program implemented at scale in the city of Kananga (DRC) by the Ministry of Justice and a local NGO. In this program, citizens with local disputes are randomly assigned to receive subsidized mediation overseen by state lawyers, customary chiefs, or to remain in the status quo. We compare the impartiality of the state and customary justice system and examine eﬀects of the program on property rights security and citizens’ views of and willingness to pay for the formal state."
