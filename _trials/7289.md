abstract: "The purpose of this research is to study the implicit biases that may be present in child maltreatment reporting decisions. Participants in this study are randomly assigned to either the mandatory reporter condition or the permissive reporter condition. Participants will read a series of ten short vignettes detailing interactions between a parent and their child. They will then be asked to decide how likely they are to report the interaction to the authorities as suspected child abuse or neglect (definitely report, likely to report, unlikely to report, definitely not report). They will be asked to answer several demographic questions at the end of the survey."
