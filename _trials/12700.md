abstract: "Pay transparency policies have become increasingly prevalent in recent years, holding the potential to foster a more equitable and inclusive labor market. However, our understanding of the mechanisms through which these policies operate, particularly in the context of negotiation dynamics between candidates and employers, remains limited due to a lack of real-world data on negotiation processes (Cullen, 2023). In this project, we aim to fill this important gap in the literature by directly studying employer demand and their decision-making regarding candidates who negotiate, and how this dynamic changes under the influence of pay transparency laws. Pay transparency laws can limit firms' flexibility in negotiating salaries with candidates. When the salary range is made public, firms may exhibit a reduced willingness to negotiate due to anticipated broader re-negotiations, concerns regarding fairness, or recognition of candidates strategically navigating the job market armed with more information. Conversely, employers may explore alternative methods to compensate candidates, such as offering non-salary benefits or promoting them to higher positions with higher salary ranges. We will also investigate these firm responses based on the gender of candidates, as negotiation behaviors can be perceived as signals of candidate attributes, which may vary by gender. 
Our project aims to address this gap in knowledge by investigating the following questions:
Without pay transparency, how do employers' compensation decisions vary based on the gender of candidates during negotiations?
What impact does pay transparency have on employers' compensation decisions during salary negotiations?
How does the effect of pay transparency on employers' compensation decisions vary by the gender of the candidate?
