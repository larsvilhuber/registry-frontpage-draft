abstract: "Traditional models of asset market participation and asset allocation focus on general return and volatility expectations and neglect the role of individual beliefs in form of loss expectations. Yet, recent research suggests that biased expectations in the domain of loss potential may deter stock investment. In a computerized survey we elicit individual loss expectations to study their role in investment decision making. We test whether a simple intervention changes respondentsâ€™ beliefs and finally influences hypothetical allocation to future stock investments."
