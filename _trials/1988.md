abstract: "Municipal governments commonly confront problems with property tax collection.  We model tardy tax payers as procrastinators that have a present bias. Late payments arise due to lack of salience, lack of deterrence or lack of tax morale.  To test the importance of the different theoretical explanations, we develop and implements a randomized controlled experiment conducted with the City of Philadelphia. The structure of the experiment allows us to identify the relative importance of the three key sets of parameters of our model. "
