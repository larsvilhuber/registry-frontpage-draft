abstract: "The MIDI project is inspired by the Buurtzorg, a Dutch firm. Its purpose is to give responsibility and autonomy to the care givers in France and to observe the economic effects. To reach this goal, I will use the randomized control trial method with a French firm. 
This project reaches the responsibility and autonomy goals for the care givers by reorganizing the current business management and give a better answer to the client and workers' requests. Thus, by taking inspiration from Buurtzorg, I will organize care givers in teams of maximum 10 people on a geographic area. Among these care givers, only four of them will intervene in the care of a patient. Moreover, to increase cohesion and teamwork within a team, all the members will meet and during the meetings they will plan their next schedule, depending on their availability  and the clients' requests. Thus, these two changes will create a new social bond within the team members and between the care givers and their patients, which do not exist anymore. Furthermore, the agency's manager will have a new mission, he will be a coach: he will have more time to visit the patients and will help teams to work together and to use new digital tools.
To make the experiment, we need to select randomly agencies within the firm, to have a representative sample of the firm. I choose the individuals of the sample following a statistic law (uniform probability law) to obtain a representative selection as most as possible, it will be the test group. Thus, I take into account the fact that some agencies are rural, close to a city or urban, following the French National Institute of Statistics (INSEE). The selected agencies and employees are informed about the experiment and I ask them their consent to participate. I explain to them all the details during meeting organize with them and then they have the choice to participate. 
I will follow several variables to observe the economic effects on labor, efficiency and increasing quality. Some of these variables are the number of caregivers along a patient, of sick leaves, of day offs, of worked hours, etc. Some of these variables are directly observable through work softwares while others need a bigger work with the caregivers. Indeed, to measure some variables, I need to send questionnaires to the caregivers and to the patients. With these questionnaires, I can follow the evolution and the improvement of both the quality of their work and their quality of work life. These questionnaires are sent by three times to the test and the control groups, to follow the evolution of these variables.
Then, I deal with all the data and their are safely stocked on an extern hard disk, with an access code to protect them. The DPO also has the mission to protect these data and check if the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is abided. All the GDPR regulation is abided and an information on it is given to all questioned people.
During the experiment, the caregivers will be followed by their local managers and myself. Thus, we check if they follow the new management rules and they make all their planed appointment. Moreover, we will provide formation to the caregivers to increase their involvement, their motivation and the implication in the experiment. All these things will increase the follow-up, the quality of work life and the efficiency. 
The experiment takes place from the 1st October of 2021 to the 1st October of 2022. A delay is due to the COVID19.
