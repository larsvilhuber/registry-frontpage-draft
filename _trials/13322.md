abstract: "We survey German firm managers on sustainability reporting. Under the current German and EU-level regulation, even firms falling below the official reporting threshold may be asked to report on sustainability, for instance by supply chain partners or banks. In deciding on whether and how extensively to report, firms thus need to weigh the costs and benefits of sustainability reporting.
In an information experiment, we introduce exogenous variation in the expected benefits of reporting. The treatment group receives information that firms disclosing CO2 emissions face lower costs for bank loans. (The control group receives generic information on the importance of bank loans for firms in Germany.) We then test whether this information changes how firms assess the benefits of reporting.
