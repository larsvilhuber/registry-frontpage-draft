abstract: "This study explores how social media influencer marketing can encourage healthier eating habits among adolescents in Vietnam. With rising rates of overweight and obesity among youth posing significant public health challenges, this research aims to evaluate whether influencers on social media can positively influence young people's food choices. The study employs a randomized controlled trial design, recruiting Vietnamese adolescents through Facebook and schools. Participants will be randomly assigned to private virtual groups hosted on a popular communication app in Vietnam, with one group serving as the treatment and the other as the control. Both groups will receive standard influencer content, such as lifestyle, travel, and entertainment. However, the treatment group will also receive supplementary content from a local influencer promoting healthy eating, particularly emphasizing fruit consumption. By measuring changes in participants' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors toward healthy eating, this study seeks to generate insights into how social media can be strategically leveraged to promote healthier dietary habits among adolescents."
