abstract: "In the past 25 years, female labor force participation (FLFP) of college-educated women in Pakistan has remained stagnant at 33% even though gender gaps in college-education are narrowing. In this project, we measure and track over time the beliefs and realized labor market decisions of thousands of students graduating from Pakistan’s largest (public) university. In addition, we provide a random subset of male and female students a range of monetary incentives to encourage them to apply to jobs within 1 month of graduation. We then track students’ labor market outcomes post-intervention to test whether early job applications increase the LFP of treated female students relative to control female students, as well as treated and control male students. This is motivated by a series of focus groups and baseline surveys with college students that we conducted, which revealed that most students in our context do not start applying to jobs until a few months after graduation, and typically underestimate how long it will take them to find a job. However, women start receiving marriage offers shortly after graduating. When marriage offers outpace the arrival of job offers, women’s likelihood of participating in the labor force may decline. Therefore, the goal of this study is to understand whether encouraging female students to apply to jobs right after graduation increases their likelihood of LFP. "
