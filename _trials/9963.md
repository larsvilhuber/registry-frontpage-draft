abstract: "A substantial literature in political economy seeks to explain inequality in access to public goods and services. However, bureaucrats are typically absent or otherwise assumed to be non-strategic actors. Nevertheless, the typical rationale for bureaucrats as “producers of public goods” challenges these assumptions. As the producers and ultimate distributors of public goods and services, I argue that bureaucrats’ role in the distribution of public goods and services should be conceptualized along two dimensions: efficiency and bias. In consultation with three national government agencies in Colombia, I conduct a nationwide factorial audit experiment that measures both efficiency and bias in the administration of two large national social welfare programs.
