abstract: "We will implement a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of the FSCS program at CCD. FSCS participants work through a year-long program with a suite of services aimed at their long-term growth. The program includes multiple services including one-on-one financial coaching and education, HUD counseling, rent and utility assistance, employment services, and targeted financial assistance to incentivize behaviors. By bundling the provision of financial, housing, and employment services under one roof as a part of a year-long commitment, CCD aims to not only help clients address their immediate needs, but also help them make progress toward their long-term goals and aspirations. CCD will aim to recruit approximately 800 study participants over two years starting in December 202. Outcomes will be measured in administrative data on credit usage, employment and earnings, and government program participation, as well as through a 12-month follow-up survey."
