abstract: "This pre-analysis plan should be read as an addition to the pre-analysis plans submitted to the AEA RCT registry on September 28, 2015, and February 04, 2016, concerning the same project. The results from the initial rounds of data collection suggest that there is significant gender discrimination against male losers in mixed-sex environments where merit is the source of inequality (p < 0:001). The participants make distributive choices involving men and women and we randomly manipulate the gender composition in the distributive situations. The goals of the third round of data collection are i) to check the robustness of the finding described above, and ii) to test whether there is a significant interaction between gender discrimination and the source of inequality (merit/luck) in the mixed sex environment."
