abstract: "We examine the process of reasoning among subjects playing variants of the iterated beauty contest game on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our findings are substantially different from the behaviors observed in laboratory and newspaper experiments reported in the literature. In general, we do not find any strong evidence in favor of higher-order reasoning in the first round as well as in the following iterations of the game, which puts into question the presence of any strategic thinking among the vast majority of subjects. In addition, our results suggest that players are only weakly responsive to competitive as well as to cooperative incentives."
