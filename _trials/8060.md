abstract: "We study the effects of gender-fair framing of job titles in online job ads in cooperation with a large online job platform in Germany. We use a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. We are particularly interested in how the usage of the gender-fair variant affects the female to male applicant ratio as well as the overall number of applications. The goals of our study are (i) to investigate whether the female applicant ratio can be increased by deviating from the “generic masculinum” which is typically used in German, (ii) study whether any changes in overall applicant numbers are due to a specific sex of the applicants, and (iii) investigate whether and how these effects differ across industries and jobs.  

We focus on three broad categories of jobs as used by the online job platform: “IT & Development”, “Business and Management” and “Marketing and Sales”. For the jobs contained within these categories, we can use secondary data to see whether these jobs empirically more often are occupied by men or women. We only use full-time positions for jobs not already advertised using gender-fair titles by the hiring company within each of the above-mentioned categories. 

Our study encompasses two treatments per each of the three broad industry categories: In the baseline, we record the number of female applications for job titles using the generic masculinum.  In the gender-fair treatment, we record the female applicant ratio when jobs are advertised using a gender-fair frame.  The RCT will be conducted in cooperation with a German online job platform and all applications towards the eligible jobs, as described earlier, can be part of the study and will, upon checking eligibility, enter the RCT and thus be randomly assigned to one of the two treatments with equal probability.
