abstract: "Shocks such as extreme weather events are becoming more intense and more frequent with climate change, with well-documented long-lasting implications for welfare and poverty. However, ex-post responses to such shocks are typically provided at the height of food insecurity during the agricultural lean season and often reach households late. More recently, several governments and humanitarian actors are experimenting with early response interventions based on rapidly available satellite-based triggers to strengthen households’ ability to manage shocks, such as through shock-responsive cash transfers. Such approaches are at the core of efforts to build adaptive social protection systems. 
  
This study coordinates a multi-country randomized control trial (RCT) in the Sahel to assess the value of early response and evaluate the impact of the timing of cash transfers in mitigating the negative effects of extreme drought on household welfare. The study is integrated in the Sahel Adaptive Social Protection Program managed by the World Bank and implemented in close coordination with government agencies across the Sahel. We test the relative effectiveness of early responses to drought (providing temporary cash transfers after the weather shock but before its peak effect on household food security and welfare) versus the traditional response to drought (providing temporary cash transfers at the peak of the food insecurity crisis).
