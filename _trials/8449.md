abstract: "The investigators will conduct a cluster randomized controledl trial in maternity facilities in Kenya to evaluate the impact of a maternal and neonatal health package intervention on patient and provider outcomes. This package intervention includes two programs: PROMPTS, a digital health platform for mothers aimed to improve knowledge and health behaviors and increase careseeking behavior at the right time and place, and MENTORS, a facility-based program aimed to increase and sustain providers' knowledge and skills in basic and emergency obstetric and newborn care. Facilities will be randomized into a treatment group that receives the package or a control group that receives
usual care. Patient outcomes include health knowledge, health behaviors and health care utilization in the prenatal and postnatal period; provider outcomes include knowledge and quality of care."
