abstract: "While sanitation and nutrition interventions are both associated with better sanitation and nutrition outcomes, these interventions are usually implemented separately. There is limited evidence of programming that has jointly impacted both sanitation and nutrition outcomes. This study seeks to identify the causal impact of an integrated sanitation and nutrition program on knowledge and practices of sanitation and nutrition behaviours in Kitui County, Kenya. Villages will be randomly assigned to either receive the standard Community Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) program or an integrated CLTS+Nutrition intervention. Outcomes of interest include household-level observations of: 1) sanitation practices, including toilet use, handwashing, courtyard cleanliness, child diarrhoea and correct disposal of child faeces; and 2) nutrition practices, including proper breastfeeding, and visits to health facilities.
