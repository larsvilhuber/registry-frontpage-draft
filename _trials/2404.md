abstract: "We use a field experiment to estimate the marginal value of non-work time (MVT). During the application process to staff a national call center and data entry positions we randomly offer applicants alternative hour and wage packages. Applicant choices over these packages yield estimates for the MVT for this population of jobseekers as a function of hours worked. They also allow us to estimate a labor supply function."
