abstract: "I study the potential of enhancing parent-teacher communication to improve the development of student well-being by focusing on a more holistic view of human capital. I aim to expand the traditional focus on cognitive skills, typically measured by standardized test scores, to include non-cognitive skills that are vital for students' social and emotional development. I study the hypothesis that discrepancies in the prioritization of these skills between parents and teachers may lead to inefficient allocation of teacher effort. Specifically, I propose an intervention where information on parent preferences regarding the relative importance of various human capital dimensions is systematically provided to teachers. Parents are surveyed to gauge their preferences across a comprehensive range of human capital aspects, which include cognitive, social, and emotional capabilities. Concurrently, teachers are surveyed to understand their perceptions and the degree to which they believe these align with the parentsâ€™ preferences. I estimate the impact on student outcomes, teacher beliefs, as well as parent satisfaction. This study will be carried out in elementary and middle school classrooms in India, characterized by high student-to-teacher ratios, where personal knowledge of students might be limited due to structural constraints. The expectation is that by informing teachers about student needs, proxied by parent preferences, this study could reveal a cost-effective method for nurturing holistic student development, with implications for educational systems looking to integrate non-cognitive skill growth alongside academic learning."
