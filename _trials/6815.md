abstract: "We designed a field experiment in the United States to evaluate how the price sensitivity and sensitivity to provider personal characteristics of consumers of medical care change under an environment with richer information on provider quality compared to an environment without such information. Our motivation stems from the facts that evidence on whether healthcare consumers are price sensitive remain largely equivocal, while the  evidence on the nature of consumer racial and gender discrimination of healthcare provider remain scant. More broadly, our study will shed light on the little known aspects of consumer behavior and preferences of the 30M+ uninsured Americans. We will launch a large-scale choice-based conjoint survey experiment with real stakes with actual healthcare consumers. Finally, this experiment will contribute to the important topic if healthcare consumerism. "
