abstract: "The aim of the study is to validate the Multidimensional Attitudes Scale Toward Persons With Disabilities (MAS), applied to visual disabilities, in a sample of about 300 upper-secondary school students from 18 classes in 3 schools in the province of Trento Italy. An additional treatment group will be added to the original scale; a randomly chosen group of students will be asked to image the vignette in the study from their own perspective. Several covariates will be used: the Implicit Association Test applied to visual disability (Greenwald, Nosek and Banaji, 2003), the Attitudes Toward Disabled Persons scales 15 items shortened scale, applied to visual disability (Yuker 1970), and several demographics variables (gender, parental education, language spoken at home, age, indicators of contact with persons with visual disability).
