abstract: "This research employs an artefactual framed-field experiment with students at the investigating University to assess how representation affects individuals’ perceptions of their own academic ability as well as their likelihood to pursue higher education. The experiment also investigates participants’ perceptions of the likelihood that their peers will pursue further education, by gender. Participation is open to current University students at the investigating University across all degree levels and academic fields. 

Participants will view a video depicting a panel of notable academics. Treatments will vary across the panel depicted with regards to the gender diversity of the academics shown. Participants will be asked a series of questions both before and after the video is shown to compare treatment effects. We assess the impact of representation in academia on students’ perceptions of their own aptitude, their likelihood of pursuing further education, and the likelihood their male and female peers will pursue further education. Expert predictions will also be elicited and compared to experimental outcomes."
