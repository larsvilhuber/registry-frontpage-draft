abstract: "The study evaluates the impacts of three different interventions introduced in the context of the Health Services Improvement Project that is implemented by the government of Tajikistan with the support of the World Bank. More specifically, the impact evaluation seeks to ascertain: (i) the impact and cost-effectiveness of a performance-based financing (PBF) model implemented in Tajikistan; and (ii) whether PBF is more effective or cost-effective if implemented in conjunction with additional low cost interventions. The other interventions are Collaborative Quality Improvement (CQI) and Citizen Score Cards (CS). The PBF shceme was introduced in selected districts and will be evaluated with a difference-in-difference approach. The CQI and CSC interventions were introduced in randomly selected health centers in both PBF and control district.  "
