abstract: "Policymakers agree that strong teachers are necessary to a high-quality education. However, it can be difficult to identify the most successful teachers, particularly in developing countries where absenteeism is pervasive. To better motivate teachers, researchers have studied teacher incentive programs, the link between teacher pay and student achievement. However, there is little evidence that suggests that these standard incentive programs enhance teacher performance. Researchers analyzed whether framing bonus payments in terms of losses (utilizing the notion of loss aversion) rather than gains would cause teachers to respond differently. The main result is that teachers with the loss aversion model had students with higher math scores (between 0.201 and 0.338 standard deviations) than those in the standard incentive program. "
