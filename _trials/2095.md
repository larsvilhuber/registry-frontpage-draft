abstract: "Finnish Basic Income Experiment is a large scale randomized field experiment organized by the Social Insurance Institution of Finland. The experiment began in January 2017 and it includes 2,000 unemployed workers receiving basic income. The basic income is 560 euros per month and it is paid unconditionally for two years. We will evaluate the effect of this basic income model using register-based data. Our main objective is to estimate the effect of this basic income model on labor supply. Our secondary outcomes include earnings, income, participation in labor market programs, and health indicators."
