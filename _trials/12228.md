abstract: "This study aims to identify the effect of using taxpayers’ identification information in contact messages (SMS) on tax compliance rates by means of a RCT.  Specifically, this trial will allow us to identify the role of personal information in contact messages reminding taxpayers about their tax obligations on increasing tax compliance rates among taxpayers who do not submit tax reports on time. 

To achieve this objective, we designed an RCT where a sample of individuals who did not comply on time were randomly assigned to three treatment arms. Individuals in the first treatment group receive a personalized SMS, while those in the second treatment group receive a non-personalized SMS. For this trial, personalization corresponds to the use of the given name of the taxpayer at the beginning of the message. Finally, the third group corresponds to the control group, where individuals do not receive any SMS.  Regardless of the treatment, all reminders are sent at the end of the business day following each taxpayer’s due date, and its content only differs in whether it is personalized or not. 

We will evaluate the effect of this intervention in two key outcomes: tax compliance rate and tax revenue.
