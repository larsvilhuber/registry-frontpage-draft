abstract: "This study relies on data from a large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) implemented in 300 public high schools, targeting grades 9th through 11th. The experimental sample was stratified by region and, within each strata, schools were paired by their similarity in terms of observable characteristics. The treatment was randomized at the school level, within each matched pair. The program was implemented in the second half of the school year, between August and December 2016. "
