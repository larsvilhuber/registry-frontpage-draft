abstract: "Using a randomised control trial in Flemish secondary education, our study aims to investigate the determinants of peer effects in a computer-assisted entrepreneurship education programme. To establish our results, schools are randomly assigned to a control condition, an experimental condition in which students work individually, and an experimental condition in which students work in pairs. The comparison of the three conditions allows us to separately identify the effect of the programme itself and the effect of cooperative learning on various student outcomes. Moreover, using the second experimental condition, we are able to identify the causal impact of differences in peer characteristics by randomly assigning students to pairs. We consider a large set of individual and peer characteristics (such as the socioeconomic background, cognitive ability, learning preferences, and personality traits). In addition, we aim to identify the underlying channel of cooperative learning using the quality of cooperation (such as the degree of discussion and helpfulness of the peer) and studentsâ€™ motivational state as instruments."
