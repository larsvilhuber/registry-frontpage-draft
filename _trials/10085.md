abstract: "Digital job tools promise to reduce frictions on the labor market. In this randomized controlled trial, we study an intervention seeking to increase the usage of a public online platform in France. The intervention, implemented with an adaptive design, consists in sending mails to job seekers, providing information, help and motivation to register or update their profiles on the platform. We seek to discover which treatments maximize uptake of the tool among the several types of incentives considered. We then analyze the impact of the platform's use on labor market outcomes."
