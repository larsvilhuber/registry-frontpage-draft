abstract: "This project examines the effects of an early literacy intervention, Læseklar (meaning ready-to-read in Danish), targeting the students most at -risk of reading difficulties in kindergarten grade (0. klasse).  The literacy program combines a) one-to-one and small group tutoring, b) a focus on phonemic awareness and phonics, and c) multi-sensory learning methods.

We evaluate the The intervention is evaluated with a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Approximately 100-120 students in 13-16 Danish schools will participate in the experiment. The participating schools will screen all kindergarten students in the kindergarten grade and select the students most at -risk for developing reading difficulties. The selected students are then pre-tested and individually randomized to either treatment or a waiting list control group.  

The primary outcome measure will be a standardized test of decoding. The students will also be tested with two other measures of reading skills: one standardized test of letter knowledge and one standardized test of phonological awareness. We will also use measure effects on executive functions, such as three validated measures related to executive functioning skills as outcome measures: working memory, verbal memory and attention/inhibitory control.  

Two recent studies conducted by members of the research team, one of them a randomized controlled trial (RCT), have found large positive short-term effects of the literacy program in Swedish schools. The current trial will provide a replication in a new context and test how general cognitive skills, such as attention and memory, are affected. In turn, these measures will provide knowledge of the mechanisms of how the program works and a better understanding of how this program and similar early interventions can be further improved.
