abstract: "In developing countries, overexploitation of natural resources often occurs when authorities and exploiters collude and ignore environmental regulations. This issue is particularly acute in Sub-Saharan Africa, where environmental decision-making, monitoring, and control are decentralized. In this context, local authorities, who possess substantial control over local resources and are difficult to monitor, can be susceptible to undue influence. We run a lab-in-the-field experiment in rural Burundi with local authorities and charcoal producers to understand how rent-seeking behavior leads to overexploitation. Using a simple dynamic game, we allow participants to engage in bribery and adjust game parameters to observe the conditions in which this occurs. We aim to contribute to the literature on how institutions can be designed to encourage sustainable exploitation of natural resources by users and regulators.
