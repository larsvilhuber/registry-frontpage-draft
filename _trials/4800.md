abstract: "A lot of the literature on active information avoidance has identified a clear objective for people to
avoid information: Self-Image protection. In these studies, this happens through willful ignorance
about a specific attribute of themselves. This research has identified several factors that influence
this importance and identified intelligence and attractiveness as reliable categories. This has also
been shown in various experiments, where people that get a bad but imprecise
signal about either their IQ or attractiveness have a positive willingness to pay to avoid more
precise information about that. Potentially, this behavior can be hurtful in other instances because
a more precise knowledge of these facts could lead to better outcomes in markets (finding a more
suitable career path, acting more informed in the dating market etc.). In our first experiment we
used a general intelligence test to investigate this behavior (conducted at same place in October 2018). Our main questions
were to what extent people avoid potentially hurtful information and are they willing to pay for it.
Our results show two main results:
1- Individuals are willing to pay not to learn their relative rank in a general intelligence test 
2-Almost half of the sample (N=400) didn’t chose to learn their rank when there is a clear monetary
gain of learning.
In the present experiment we use a similar framework with neutral information in terms of ego
utility to show the change in avoidance when there is only clear instrumentality of information to reach higher monetary gain. This study focuses on two main questions: 
1- What is the impact of
ego relevant information on avoidance keeping the value of information constant? 
2- Does avoidance
respond to value of information when the instrumental of information is clearly higher?"
