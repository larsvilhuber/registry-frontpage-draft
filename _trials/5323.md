abstract: "Developing interpersonal trust outside the close-knit circle of known people and community members is a key determinant for the success of impersonal trade and economic development. In this project, I study how property rights impact on the development of trust and trustworthiness preferences affecting in-group and out-group members of a community. Specifically, I study the effects of a land tenure reform implemented in a West African country that transformed collective and informal land rights in a system akin to private ownership.
I combine the peculiar implementation of the reform with a Trust game designed to elicit trust and trustworthiness preferences both within the rural village participants belong to and between participants belonging to different villages. "
