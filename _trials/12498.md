abstract: "The research goal of this study is to understand how men react to learning about the long-term financial consequences of having a reduced workload. In particular, we design a field experiment where the treatment consists of an informational video discussing the long-term financial consequences of a reduced workload. We compare this treatment to a control group that receives a video with unrelated information."
