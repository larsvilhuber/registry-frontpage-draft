abstract: "The labour market in Ghana is largely characterised by informal recruitment practices (such as through personal networks, etc). While these practices may not be bad in themselves, the scale at which they are used can reduce the information flow and competitiveness in the recruitment process. This can affect the efficiency of the labour market in matching vacancies to more suitable candidates. Efficient labour markets can match workers with the most suitable jobs for their skill set as well as incentivise both employees and employers to act in ways that promote productivity. Thus, an efficient labour market makes it possible for workers to work as efficiently as possible and makes it possible for employers to provide the right incentives. In November 2019, the government of Ghana, through its Youth Employment Agency (YEA) established a Job Centre online platform to play a crucial role in coordinating and facilitating job placements. This is the first public online general job portal that is designed to provide free employment services to Ghanaian residents, especially the youth who are searching for entry to mid-career level positions. The YEA Job Centre portal allows job seekers to register, and search for jobs or can upload their CVs to advertise themselves to prospective employers. It also allows employers to register their businesses or institutions, place advertisements for vacancies or request the Job Centre to recruit personnel for them.
In this study, we evaluate the impact of the job Centre portal on labour market efficiency in Accra in the context of a randomized control trial. In our design we randomize job vacancies in treatment and control arms where vacancies in the treatment arms are advertised on the job centre portal while employers of vacancies in the control arm are allowed to recruit using their usual (informal) means.
