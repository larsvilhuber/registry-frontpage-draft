abstract: "Using a unique data set from a German health check-up provider we have compiled a concise and validated questionnaire tool to estimate individuals' risk for high cholesterol levels. We now apply this tool in an online experiment in order to study individual health information avoidance behavior. In particular, we use our tool to classify individuals into ‘healthy’ and ‘unhealthy’ individuals, and ask (1) which group participates more in health check-ups, (2) whether a potential difference in participation rates between the two groups is driven by selection, and (3) whether we can influence selection by increasing the salience of potentially bad news. Hereby, we base our hypotheses on a pilot study in which we find that healthy individuals have higher check-up rates than unhealthy individuals. "
