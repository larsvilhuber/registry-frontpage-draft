abstract: "Religion serves as an important source of beliefs for many across the world yet we know little about how religion and religious leaders contribute to belief formation. In this study, I exploit a unique partnership with the Punjab Auqaf Department in Pakistan, responsible for running state religious properties, to experimentally vary sermon content in 300 mosques and evaluate the causal impact of religious sermons on mosque-goers' social beliefs and behavior. By randomizing imams to sermon scripts emphasizing the importance of community rights and women's rights, I explore the importance of religious messaging for prosociality towards neighbors, community engagement, and attitudes towards women's social and economic participation.
