abstract: "Traditionally, information has been assumed to never harm consumers, a notion recently challenged. Salience nudges have been argued to evoke negative emotions, therefore acting as “emotional taxes.” We examine the emotional and consumer welfare impact of a calorie salience nudge (calorie menu labeling) – a policy implemented nationwide in the U.S. in 2018. We use a theoretical framework and a hypothetical restaurant meal experiment. We find a calorie salience nudge may act as an emotional tax, but only for some – there is considerable heterogeneity in the emotional response to the nudge. We also find that this heterogeneity is helpful -- the nudge emotionally taxes people with low eating self-control, while it emotionally subsidizes those with higher levels of eating self-control. Similarly, we find that overall consumer welfare increases with the calorie salience nudge, but that the short-term welfare impact ranges from negative to positive. People with low self-control short-term negatively value the salience nudge. This also presents the risk of people with low self-control avoiding the nudge and losing out on its long-term benefits. People with high self-control positively value the nudge. We find no distributional effects over income from the calorie salience nudge."
