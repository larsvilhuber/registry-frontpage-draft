abstract: "This research project centers on the Novotec Integrado Program, designed to enhance technical and vocational education offerings in São Paulo, Brazil. This initiative seamlessly integrates technical education into the traditional high school curriculum, aligning with the regulatory reforms established in 2017.Within the public high school system, students have the autonomy to select a specialized field of technical education. During enrollment periods in 2021 and 2023, instances of oversubscription prompted admissions to be determined through a lottery system, facilitating an experimental impact evaluation framework. Our primary objective is to assess the effects of Novotec Integrado on enrolled students. Specifically, we aim to evaluate its impact on key indicators such as academic performance, school attendance, and high school completion rates. Furthermore, we seek to quantify its influence on labor market outcomes and enrollment in higher education. To achieve these objectives, we will utilize educational administrative data and conduct comprehensive primary data collection efforts."
