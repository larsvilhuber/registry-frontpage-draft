abstract: "Trade is an important channel for firm growth and economic development. E-Commerce offers new opportunities for SMEs in developing countries to market and sell their products abroad to more, and potentially more distant clients. As a consequence, SMEs may be able to sell at higher prices, generate higher profits and increase their margins at the expense of intermediaries. However, technology adoption often remains low among SMEs in developing countries, due to supply-side related constraints like lack of knowledge, resources or demand-side factors such as lack of clients with ability to pay for higher quality goods. In this randomized controlled trial, we assess whether the provision of training and technical assistance increases the adoption of e-commerce technology among SMEs in Tunisia and also investigate its impact on exports. We further investigate the intervention's impact on more immediate outcomes such as web traffic, social media followers and perceptions about the technology. "
