abstract: "We are testing the effectiveness of offering payment flexibility to consumer borrowers in India during the COVID-19 crisis.  We test whether offering late-paying borrowers who have taken out loans to purchase smartphones in India an additional 3 months to repay their loan improves the performance of the loans, how it affects borrowersâ€™ perceptions of the lender, and their willingness to do repeat business with the lender."
