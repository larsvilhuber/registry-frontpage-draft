abstract: "A growing body of research, pioneered by Dana et al. (2007), has documented the prevalence of strategic ignorance in social decisions (e.g., Matthey and Regner 2011; Grossman 2014; van der Weele 2014; Feiler 2014; Exley 2016; Grossman and van der Weele 2017; Momsen and Ohndorf 2020, 2023; Serra-Garcia and Szech 2021): although people frequently incur a private cost to bring about some social benefit under conditions of full information, when the social benefit is uncertain, a surprisingly large number of people avoid easy opportunities to resolve this uncertainty and revert to selfish behavior.
Although ignorance may stem from confusion or lack of interest, some individuals avoid information for strategic reasons, such as maintaining positive self - or social image (Nyborg 2011, Grossman 2014, Grossman and van der Weele 2017, Exley and Kessler 2021). Our social interactions frequently unfold in situations much richer than the simple two-person decision environment modeled in the basic moral-wiggle-room game introduced by Dana et al. (2007)—henceforth DWK. For example, other people with whom we interact might be able to either supply the information which we wish to avoid or at the very least point out our attempts to avoid it. Someone dining with an aspiring vegetarian could say, “you know that soup is made with chicken stock, right?” or “aren’t you going to ask what’s in that soup?”. Avoiding clicking on articles with headlines like, “Fast fashion: how clothes are linked to climate change,” doesn’t stop people from discussing such articles in your presence. If some people strictly prefer ignorance (as opposed to merely being indifferent to information), then externally imposing information on them might harm them. 
The present study aims to explore how third parties with the option to inform dictators of the potential consequences of their choices affect the behavior of dictators, particularly those who would otherwise wish to avoid that information. We will use the moral-wiggle-room game of DWK as the fundamental decision because of its simplicity and to maintain comparability with other studies. In particular, we will look at whether the presence of such third parties affects dictators’ information and allocation choices, whether the dictator is willing to reward sanction or punish the behavior of the informer, and whether such potential reward punishment deters bystanders from providing information. The goal is to shed further light on the strategic nature of information avoidance, the conditions under which it may manifest as an image-management strategy, and how social outcomes are determined in environments with richer social interactions.
