abstract: "In this study, we develop a framework to formalize the concept of hassle costs in a utility maximization framework. We relate hassle costs to the shadow cost of leisure. Second, we propose an experimental procedure to elicit the distribution of marginal hassle cost in sample population. Third, we implement and validate our approach in a large-scale field experiment promoting the adoption of heat pump technology. 
 
One important set of goals of this study is to increase home energy retrofit adoption and identify barriers in this context. The retrofits we will focus on are heat pumps. We intend to carry a household mailer campaign in which the mailers would include the value of available rebates and benefits of heat pumps and also make use of a survey to quantify hassle costs that may impede heat pump uptake. The main contribution of this research is providing a quantification of the marginal hassle cost associated with the increase in the adoption of low-carbon technologies.
