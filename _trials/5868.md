abstract: "We study a cohort of students at the School of Business, Economics, and Society at a German university in their second semester which is entirely held online due to the COVID-pandemic. We design and implement a program that provides students with a student advisor from a more advanced semester. The mentors and mentees meet one-on-one online and work on a plan for the semester, discuss issues in working from home or studying generally, and the mentors provide suggestions on how to study effectively. To determine whether and how students respond to the intervention, we measure the mentees' performance in exams."
