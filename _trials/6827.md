abstract: "Exposing voters to non-state-provisioned information is presumed to counter incumbentsâ€™ efforts to keep voters uninformed in order to remain in power. In this study, I estimate the effect of randomized door-to-door information campaigns on voter behavior and ideology in Turkey. My design allows me to estimate heterogeneous effects of information campaigns. I find that voter response to the same campaigns increased political polarization and the effect persisted at least two years. I conclude that reducing censorship can be polarizing and, because average measures mask both positive and negative treatment effects, the impact of information campaigns on civil society is underestimated."
