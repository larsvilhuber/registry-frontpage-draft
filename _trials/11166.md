abstract: "We study how people solve statistical problems. We test a model in which selective attention to different features of problems yields multimodality in beliefs. Our experiments are designed to change the distribution of participants beliefs by manipulating the contrast or prominence of various features while (typically) holding constant the underlying statistical problem.
