abstract: "Amidst continually increasing evidence in favour of vaccination, hesitancy is sharply divided along political lines. This project will quantitatively assess to what degree vaccine hesitancy can be attributed to (1) a lack of information on COVID-19 and its vaccines, and (2) politically motivated reasoning and exposure to abundant misinformation. Using a large-scale randomized control trial, we will test scalable interventions that provide basic information about vaccines and other interventions designed to combat misinformation and biased reasoning on vaccination. Ultimately, we hope to deliver communication tools that allow healthcare providers to identify which individuals will be receptive to good-faith conversations on the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination as well as productively engage those who are otherwise determined to reject any information that is perceived to be pro-vaccination. Our approach will adapt the communication tools of “Paradoxical Reasoning” which were developed to unfreeze entrenched beliefs in the context of the most intractable conflicts (e.g., the Israeli-Palestinian border conflict)."
