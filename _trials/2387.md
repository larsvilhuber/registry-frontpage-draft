abstract: "In 2014, as part of the “Skill India” agenda, the government set up an ambitious training program, called DDU-GKY, which targets young high-school dropouts living in poor rural areas. The effectiveness of training and placement programs is often limited by the scarcity of job opportunities. The Indian context is particularly interesting because job vacancies are supposed to abound and finding workers who will join when offered a job is difficult. 
In collaboration with a private training provider and the government of Odisha, we will test two different interventions to provide information on the training and placement process to potential candidates, in order to maximise training completion and placement rates. First, we will send to randomly-selected villages well-trained mobilisers equipped with a portfolio of media to catch the attention and inform potential candidates (leaflets, videos...). Second, we will add to the previous intervention a “parents ambassador” scheme, whereby the parents of successful program participants will be trained to disseminate information about the DDU-GKY program in the village where they live. Ambassador parents (“mobilisers”) will be selected on a voluntary basis and trained in disseminating information about the program. "
