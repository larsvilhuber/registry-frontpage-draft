abstract: "From July 2015 through December 2018, the Colorado Department of Human Services (CDHS) randomly assigned access to ReHire Colorado among all program applicants. This study estimates experimental impacts of ReHire on employment, earnings, benefit receipt, and other outcomes. Treatment group individuals received access to ReHire-funded services. Case managers worked with participants to address employment barriers, provide targeted financial assistance, and help match participants to subsidized employment. Participants were eligible for a 30-week subsidized job. We measure outcomes for treatment and control group applicants before and during the program, as well as over the two years following application using administrative data on employment and earnings, SNAP and TANF benefit receipt, and credit outcomes, as well as with an 18-month follow-up survey that measured post-application work, well-being, employment barriers, workplace behaviors, and expectations about the future."
