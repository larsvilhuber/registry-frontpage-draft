abstract: "We study how culture is related to economic decision making via language. We focus on the Aymara language used in the west part of Bolivia, and control by Spanish as well as two other native languages (Guarani and Quechua). Subjects will play games where rewards depend on intertemporal decision making and risk behavior. "
