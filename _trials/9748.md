abstract: "Domestic abuse (DA) is a widespread problem worldwide.  We are working with an English police force on an RCT designed to reduce DA recidivism.  The intervention is based on a provision of English law that enables police to disclose to a DA victim information about her partnerâ€™s prior DA history.  "
