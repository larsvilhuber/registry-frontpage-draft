abstract: "This correspondence experiment tests for potential discriminatory treatment by employees of the Social Security Service in the Czech Republic, specifically the public servants dealing with unemployment benefits. Our focus is on potential differential treatment of Roma minority versus the Czech majority. Roma people are one of the largest ethnic minorities in the  Czech Republic (1.5-3%) as well as in the EU. According to the European Commission (2010), a significant part of 10-12 million Roma in Europe live in extreme marginalization. Differential treatment by public officials, if any, may reinforce the repercussions of existing discrimination of Roma in private markets (see e.g. Barto≈° et al. 2016). At the same time, the experiment will test for potentially positive discrimination of minorities by public servants (a commonly held belief in the Czech Republic)."
