abstract: "We present representative evidence that perceptions about relative rank in the wealth distribution shape individuals’ willingness to take risks, and that this effect is moderated by a key personality trait, an individuals’ locus of control. Using a large-scale survey in Germany, we manipulate perceptions of relative wealth standing by randomly varying response categories when asking respondents about their wealth level. We measure their risk tolerance in a subsequent incentivized lottery task. Our results indicate that respondents who are induced to perceive
their relative position as low choose riskier lotteries on average. We show that this effect is mainly driven by people who more firmly believe that life outcomes are beyond their control (external locus of control). This interaction between preferences and individuals’ underlying belief systems highlights the benefits of incorporating personality traits into economic analysis."
