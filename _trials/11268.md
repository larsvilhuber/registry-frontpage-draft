abstract: "Developing countries are characterized by large productivity gaps between sectors and high specialization in agriculture in rural areas. Although domestic migration is common in these contexts, it is below levels that would equalize productivity gaps. In this project, we study the role of informational and social capital in home villages for migration decisions and outcomes. We test whether an intensive information treatment in form of two mentoring sessions leads to a change in migration perceptions, intent, behavior and experiences of the treated individual as well as untreated individuals in the village community. We use rich village-level network data to study information diffusion and spillovers in migration outcomes."
