abstract: "Reading and math skills have a direct impact on people's lives. Lacking these skills constitutes an important barrier against effective communication, and therefore against the development of the individual within society. An early deficiency in reading and mathematics levels is correlated with lower academic performance, a higher level of dropout, and worse labor market outcomes.

Resolving these deficiencies at early ages has two main potential benefits. First, it unravels the development of the person, making it easier for him/her to progress in their learning (dynamic gains and complementarities of future investments). Second, it improves the ability to work in the classroom on the part of the whole group (spillovers). The sooner such gaps and inequities are identified and addressed, the better individual and classroom educational performance will be.

The available evidence, generated from intervention projects developed in countries other than Spain (our context of interest), points to tutoring and mentoring programs as one of the most effective means to increase the academic performance of students, especially those who start at a greater disadvantage. In addition, the existing evidence points to this type of intervention as triggering other positive effects on learning (personal and transversal competences, school adherence, reduction in absenteeism, etc.).

The objective of this study is to provide evidence about the effectiveness of two interventions providing educational support, one for reading and one for mathematics, in low-socioeconomic schools located in Spain. The reading program consist of one-on-one mentoring sessions for grade 4 students aimed at fostering the pleasure for autonomous reading, The mathematics program consists of four-group tutorial sessions for grade 6 students. Within the classes of the grade for which the school is treated, only a subset of students will actually participate in our tutoring/mentoring programs.

Assigning half of the pool of participating schools into the reading program and the other half into the mathematics program, we will compare the outcomes of the students from the grade for which the school has been treated with the outcomes of the students in the same grade from schools that got assigned to the other program. Within a given treated class, students who did not actually participate in the mentoring/tutoring programs might still have their outcomes impacted through in-class spillovers.

Naturally, we will explore the impact of our intervention on reading and mathematics cognitive abilities. We will pay particular attention to how these programs affect the classroom depending on the position in the network of friends where the treated kids belong. We also explore other dimensions such as improvements in socio-emotional skills, classroom climate and behavior, and changes in social relations and friendships."
