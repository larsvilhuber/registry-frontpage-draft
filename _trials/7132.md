abstract: "Abstract
The rate of milk let down in high yielding dairy animals in the first six weeks of lactation, is so high that the secretion of nutrients into the milk exceeds the rate of uptake of nutrients from the digestive tract. The nutrient deficit is compensated by the diversion of nutrients from the body reserves (mobilization of body fat and protein) resulting in weight loss. Too large a loss in body weight can prove harmful and uneconomical. The appetite of the animal during the early lactation (up to 8 weeks) is reduced by 2 to 3 kg per day. Usually, all such cows and buffaloes will remain under negative energy balance during first five month of lactation. The sudden change in diet and feeding high concentrate diet to fulfil their demand impose the risk of rumen acidosis. The sub-acute acidosis (SARA), a type of mild acidosis has a greater economic impact due to much more prevalent and commonly occurring in dairy animals. The sub-acute acidosis prove loss in milk production by 3 kg per cow per day, milk-fat production by 3g/kg of milk and milk protein production by 1.2g/kg of milk. This will account to almost 900 L per year per animal and cause a loss of more than INR 20000.00 at the present milk prices (Bipin et al., 2016). Cation-based Mineral supplement feeding in animal’s diet leads 10 to 15 per cent increased in milk production, fat composition and reduce the service period (Mani, 2019). With this background we are going to study the effectiveness of ‘Cation-based Mineral supplement’ for increasing the milk production, milk fat and service period in cows and buffaloes’ developed by ICAR – National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI) to  reduce the post-partum problems in cows and buffaloes’ using Randomized Control Trial (RCT) in the five villages adopted by NDRI.
Objectives:
1.	To assess the impact of Cation-based Mineral supplement on performance of dairy animals.
2.	To delineate the perceived attributes of Cation-based Mineral supplement.  
3.	To predict the farmers adoption of Cation-based Mineral supplement.
