abstract: "In this study I measure the degree of projection bias people have in choices over effort -- that is, how much people mispredict their future willingness to work by projecting their current willingness to work into the future. For this I run a study with real effort tasks on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) with several sessions, where subjects sign up for additional future work both when they are rested (before they do any work) and when they are tired (after they have completed some work)."
