abstract: "A number of studies show that crime is often concentrated in a reduced number of high crime areas, furthermore, that it is highly concentrated in a small fraction of street segments, usually termed crime hotspots. Such concentration suggests that focusing police patrol time in these hotspots should be an effective strategy for preventing crime, and a number of experimental studies in the US and the UK have provided evidence to this effect. In an attempt to tackle violent criminal activity in the municipality of Sucre in Caracas, Venezuela, the mayorâ€™s office and the municipal police decided to run a randomized control trial to evaluate the impact of a hotspots policing strategy on the incidence of homicide. Police are required to deliver four 15 minute visits to each hotspot over every 24 hour period, sometimes simply under a guardianship role and other times stopping and searching. The program is currently being implemented.
