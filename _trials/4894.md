abstract: "This research aims to use a field experiment to investigate whether reminders to donate at the time of purchase can affect the number and type of in-kind charitable donations made to a local food provision organisation, and to see how these effects change over time. The signs use messaging which makes the local aspect of the recipients salient.
A commonly cited reason for not donating to the FoodBank is that visitors to a supermarket forget to make a donation until they have already reached the end of their shopping and paid for their items. In conjunction with key items not being donated, this leaves great room for improvement in the type and level of donations made to the FoodBank. FoodBanks receive around half of their total donations from donation points in supermarkets, so getting this element of their strategy right would have large effects on their overall stock levels. 
The use of shelf level signs to remind individuals to purchase an item for donation during their shop, and highlight which items are most needed, would appear to solve these two barriers to donation. These have been trialled in some stores in the UK, but as of yet the effect of these signs on donation rates has not been investigated.
