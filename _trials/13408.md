abstract: "The study examines the acceptability of environmental taxes (local air pollutant tax and carbon tax) in the field of urban transportation. It employs a laboratory economic experiment in which participants make commute mode choices (public transport vs. passenger vehicle) and determine whether or not they agree to implement environmental taxes on passenger vehicle mobility. It is hypothesized that, by experiencing the benefits of the environmental taxes, participants will find them more acceptable. However, the question of a substitution effect regarding the acceptability of each possible tax remains open."
