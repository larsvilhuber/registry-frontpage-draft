abstract: "We separate the incentive, selection and voter activism effects associated with improvements in available information. We conducted a multi-year field experiment in the capital city of Delhi where, working in conjunction with a local NGO, we used the Right to Information Act to obtain detailed information on the performance record of local councilors (each of whom were elected to a five-year term in 2007).

The innovation of this study is the use of an experimental design that allows us to disentangle several effects. First, we isolate the standard incentive effect coming from the fear of being penalized by voters. Second, we identify whether voters became more aggressive in demanding entitlements in response to information about their rights and the performance of their representative. Third, we are able to identify any selection effects by looking at the results of the 2012 elections.

The experiment has several treatments: In July 2010, councilors in Treatment 1 were informed that their individual performance along specific dimensions would be reported to voters in the run-up to the next election (in March 2012). Councilors in Treatment 2 saw their constituents receive report cards on their performance during July 2010 and were informed that another report card would be delivered in early 2012. In a subset of the second group of wards (Treatment 3), we also undertook an active voter mobilization campaign. Finally, councilors in the control sample were informed that the NGO will not produce report cards on their performance until at least 2014. The main effect of Treatment 1 is the standard incentive effect, while there is an additional effect of voters directly putting pressure on politicians throughout the term in Treatment 2, and to an even greater extent in Treatment 3.

Using household surveys and objective measures of service delivery, we examine whether the interventions alter councilor behavior and service delivery. We also track whether parties replace their worst performing incumbents in the 2012 elections and whether there are any adverse responses when politicians do not wish to change their behavior (e.g. vote-buying, intimidation)."
