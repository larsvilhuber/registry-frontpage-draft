abstract: "We provide participating firms with information on future search durations in days to fill a vacancy with a suitable person in the firm's main occupation. We examine the effects on their beliefs about how long it will take to find a suitable employee for such a vacancy in their firm, and on their expectations of how wages and salaries will develop in their firm in the next 12 months."
