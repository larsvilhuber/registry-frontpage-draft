abstract: "We employ an online randomized lab experiment to estimate the impact of a company's bankruptcy status on consumer demand for that company's products and services. We identify each participant's willingness to pay for a product of a firm. We measure how that willingness to pay changes when we exogenously vary information about the firm's bankruptcy status. We also exogenously vary information about the purpose of the survey to study experimenter demand."
