abstract: "Individuals usually tradeoff between consuming their favorite food and staying healthy. Diet health is a crucial determinant of many common diseases including obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and so on. Governments around the world have invested substantial resources to improve individuals’ dietary habits, but the consequences are far from satisfactory. An established literature has proposed different methods to influence individual decisions that involve the self-control problem such as smoking. However, systematic comparisons among different methods are insufficient, especially in the domain of diet healthiness. This project aims at investigating the effect of different incentives or choice architectures on individuals’ food choices in terms of diet healthiness. In our experiment, subjects are given lists of 20 items of food—10 fruits and 10 snacks—and are asked to select 10 items to receive. We randomly assign subjects into eight conditions: one condition as the baseline, one condition using the classical method of financial incentives, and six conditions using methods of choice architecture, with variations in the provision of calorie information, availability of the half portion option, default, recommendation, and bundle, and the presentation order of food. We are mainly interested in comparisons among these eight conditions in outcomes including individuals’ willingness to consume fruits, nutrition in the selected basket, and decision process. "
