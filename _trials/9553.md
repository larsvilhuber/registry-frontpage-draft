abstract: "The project investigates goal-gradient behavior in the domain of charitable giving by means of a natural field experiment. In collaboration with a large charitable organization, we aim at shedding light on the role of fundraising campaign goals and perceived goal proximity on individual donation decisions. Regular donors are contacted via postal mailing in which they are asked if they are willing to increase their regular donation amount. In the letters, we vary information on arbitrary campaign goals and progress towards achieving the goal, randomly assign receivers to different treatment groups and compare donation incidences between groups."
