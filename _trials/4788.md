abstract: "The recent large inflows of refugees to many Western countries has spurred a large, and often intense, debate on how to best integrate the refugees into their new countries. Finding successful integration policies is very important from both the refugees' and the host countries' perspective.

In this project we will evaluate a new and uniquely ambitious integration program that was developed and put into effect in Sweden. The aim with the program, run in cooperation by the City of Gothenburg and the Public Employment Office (PES) in Gothenburg, was to get newly arrived refugees to Sweden better integrated (in terms of, e.g., labor market outcomes).

The evaluation will be based on a randomized experiment, in which potential participants in the program in one of the waves were randomly assigned into treatment and control groups."
