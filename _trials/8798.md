abstract: "Based on my prior research in West Africa, I have found variation in the data by enumerator education.  The prior data shows a difference by enumerator education.  Three of my male enumerators with various levels of education (advanced degree, university degree, elementary education) exhibit different responses to questions about wellbeing/happiness and identity.  This paper will test several hypotheses based on the preexisting data to see if there is an effect.  Each respondent will collect data as they have done on prior projects asking the same questions.  They will reveal nothing explicitly about their education.  Based on prior data the hypotheses are as follows: 1. Respondents will report lower personal level of wellbeing to highly educated enumerator compared to enumerator with lower level of education; 2. Respondents will rate enumeratorâ€™s level of wellbeing as higher when enumerator has high level of education compared to low level of education; 3. Respondent is more likely to report good things about the government (i.e., less corruption and more support for the current president) to the highly educated enumerator compared to the less educated enumerator.  Results of this analysis carry important implications as major surveys of life in Africa and beyond use only highly educated enumerators.  Doing so could be producing serious measurement error.  "
