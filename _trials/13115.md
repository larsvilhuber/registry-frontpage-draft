abstract: "We analyze the effect of a series of two nudge interventions (letters) on farmers' choice of adopting climate-friendly farming practices. Our hypothesis posits that nudges exert a positive influence on the adoption of climate-friendly practices, particularly when these practices are straightforward to implement. To evaluate this hypothesis, we have categorized the farming practices we aim to promote through nudging, ranking them in terms of implementation difficulty, from the simplest to the most laborious. The effects of the nudges are measured using farm-level data on farmland use.
