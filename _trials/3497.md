abstract: "In the classic public goods game (PGG) subjects usually play a given number of repetitions, say 10 rounds. The number of rounds is independent of the subjects' contribution. We argue that in many cases the provision of a public good depends on past contributions, so we assume that the next round is reached only in a probabilistic manner: the more the subjects contribute, the more likely it is that there will be a next round.
We study if such a probabilistic setting changes subjects' behavior relative to the classic setup. We use an experimental design with parameters that theoretically should lead to zero contribution at the beginning of the game that in turn would mean that the game ends in round 1. However, we expect that many groups will play several rounds and there will be a high level of overall contribution in many groups."
