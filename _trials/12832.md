abstract: "The German school system stratifies students conditional on their grades after the winter term of their 4th grade. Recommendations are not binding such that thousands of parents apply for admission for schooling at the top level “Gymnasium”-High Schools for their kids. Running a randomized controlled trial in this process, we test if gender, migration background and grades have an effect on Gymnasium’s and other secondary school admission’s responsiveness to messages sent by putatively German or Turkish Families who request information on the admission process. In line with our priors from a pre-test in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, we expect that high schools across Germany discriminate against the ethnic background of students. Most notably non-German families receive significantly fewer replies even if they kid has good grades. We believe that this pre-test finding replicates across the other states of the Federal Republic of Germany. "
