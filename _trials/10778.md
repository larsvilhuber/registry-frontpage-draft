abstract: "We conduct an online experiment to test whether a simple diagnostic survey framework can predict when interventions are likely to succeed and when they are likely to fail to change behavior. Using a real-effort task, we induce three types of environments (contexts) in which there is a behavioral barrier to "optimal" behavior: (i) Lack of awareness, (ii) lack of intention, and (iii) failure to implement the intended choice. For each of these environments, we then test the effectiveness of three types of interventions that are commonly used to address the behavioral barriers (reminders, incentives, simplification). Using a within-subject design, we study whether our diagnostic questions predict treatment effects on the individual level.

The experiment was planned after data collection from a similar experiment using a between-subject design to show that the effectiveness of an intervention depends on the underlying environment and to study the average predictability of the diagnostic survey. The link to the preregistration of the original experiment's preregistration is provided below."
