abstract: "Do people remain angry over time when treated unfairly in cases involving monetary stakes? To find out, we study the effect of delay on anger in economic decision making, using a game-theoretical framework and lab experiments. Low degrees of cooperation have been indicated to bring up anger. We study how reciprocity changes where subjects have to wait before making a decision, over multiple rounds. Also, to elicit the degree of anger resulting from lack of cooperation, we employ choice-process data measures of Galvanic Skin Response and Neural Network-based face-reading software. These measures are intended to examine how people react to different cooperations, and how those emotions dissipate during the delay period."
