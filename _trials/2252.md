abstract: "The quality of the teaching force is the key factor explaining the success of educational systems. We know that teachers differ widely regarding their impact on student achievement, but previous research failed in finding the sources of this variation. Educational economists consider teacher quality as a valuable and measurable feature, but they are not able to explain what generates it. Sociologists identify teacher quality as the consequence of individual and contextual characteristics. Pedagogies interpret it as a multidimensional concept and look at teaching practices and styles in daily classroom routines. This project wants to pool together these three perspectives. We argue that educational economists fail to explain the differences in teacher effectiveness because they look at teachers characteristics that are too far from the dynamic nature of teaching/learning process and because they do not consider the role played by contextual factors. 

To prove the relevance of teacher relational skills in explaining the "mysterious" teacher quality, we are building up a collection of the best available tips to improve teacher relational skills, looking for them through international and national literature review and in depth interviews. More precisely, we producing a booklet facing six issues that teachers are called to face related to their relational skills. Each issue is treated not only in the booklet, but also with a very short video. We offered these tips to teachers in a sample of 100 lower secondary schools, randomized out of 198. Teacher used our booklet in the school year 2016/17 and, in within an action-research framework, we discuss the booklet and videos with them through registries on a platform. 

An external researcher randomly extracted 229 lower secondary schools from the official list of all public lower secondary schools in Italy, excluding the 11 provinces where we were already implementing a parallel trial (OpenTeQ). All the selected school received a box of booklets and letters to be delivered to Math and Italian teachers in the institute. 

The RCT is designed in order to test the impact of our booklet on students' achievement (in the short run, at the end of the first school year, and in the long run, at the end of the following school year - administrative data). 
This RCT is paired with OpenTeQ, another trial where we delivered the same treatment, directly meeting teachers in a smaller subsets of schools. The key idea here is estimating the intervention effectiveness, in an at scale setting."
