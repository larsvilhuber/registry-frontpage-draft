abstract: "Wikipedia is among the most important information sources for the general public. Motivating domain experts to contribute to Wikipedia can improve the accuracy and completeness of its content. In a field experiment at Wikipedia, we examine individual motivations to contribute to public information goods. Using a 2-by-3 factorial design, we vary the expectation on the number of recipients along one dimension and the amount of private benefit along the other dimension. In the analysis, we will investigate how our interventions affect the experts' willingness to participate and contribution measured by both quantity and quality."
