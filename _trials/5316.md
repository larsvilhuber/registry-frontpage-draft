abstract: "The ability to cooperate with strangers outside the restricted circle of close-knit communities and family members is a key determinant for the development of markets and the creation of well-being.  In this project, I study the causal effect that property rights institutions have on social preference for cooperation.  More specifically, the project tests how a land rights reform that modifies the system of land rights in a developing country affected the ability to cooperate within participants' communities and with strangers outside these communities. To do so, I run a multilevel public good game experiment and I combine it with the unique implementation strategy of the reform in order to achieve identification. The pre-analysis present the data sources, the structure of the experiment, and the empirical strategy."
