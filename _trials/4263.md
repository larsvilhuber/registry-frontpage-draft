abstract: "The purpose of this experiment is to test the implementation of an adaptive experimental procedure designed by the authors in a real-world context. 
The goal of many experiments is to inform the choice between different policies. However, standard experimental designs are geared toward point estimation and hypothesis testing. We consider the problem of treatment assignment in an experiment with several cross-sectional waves where the goal is to choose among a set of possible policies (treatments) for large-scale implementation. We show that optimal experimental designs learn from earlier waves by assigning more experimental units to the better-performing treatments in later waves. We propose a computationally tractable approximation of the optimal design, based on a modification of Thompson sampling. 
We collaborate with a non-profit organization that supports smallholder farmers in developing countries by providing personalized agricultural advice through mobile phones in India. We apply the proposed adaptive trial design to help the non-profit choose efficiently among several alternative call procedures (treatments) to enroll farmers into their service. Since the adaptive design is based on Bayesian optimization, it allocates more subjects to the most successful treatment arms in consecutive study waves, which improves learning and at the same time applies the more successful treatment variants earlier to more subjects.
