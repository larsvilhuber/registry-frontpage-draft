abstract: "Air pollution is one of the most serious threats to human health in South Asia. Still, environmental regulations are only partially enforced. We test if a dashboard providing bureaucrats with information about the harm of different air pollution sources can direct enforcement toward the most harmful sources. In a nationwide field experiment, we study brick kilns, one of the largest contributing factors to air pollution in Bangladesh. We document the damage of each kiln by coupling satellite data with an air quality model estimating each kilnâ€™s public health effects, create an online tracker summarizing this information, and provide it to the Department of Environment in Bangladesh. We randomize districts into two groups: treated districts, for which the tracker provides information on a random subset of sub-districts, and control districts, for which the tracker does not provide information. We will focus on the following outcomes: enforcement activities, brick kiln owners switching to less polluting technologies, and total health harm. By randomizing both across and within districts, we will test if there are spillovers on areas adjacent to those covered by the tracker."
