abstract: "This paper investigates the impact of economic status on social preferences. We exogenously alter people's perceived economic status by changing where they think their household stands in the US income distribution. Half of the people who over-estimated their position in the income distribution are told that they are relatively poorer than they thought. Conversely, half of those who under-estimated their position in the income distribution are informed that they are relatively richer than they thought. Then, participants play a series of four incentivized games, which measure different social preferences, such as trust, negative reciprocity, honesty and pro-sociality. This document outlines the analysis plan for this experiment. "
