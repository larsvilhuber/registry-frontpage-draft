abstract: "One potential driver of gender inequality is men’s and women’s preference for behaving in accordance with social norms. I conduct a survey experiment in Eastern Rwanda, measuring men’s and women’s beliefs about the gender attitudes of others in their community. This study tests: a) whether people misperceive the gender attitudes of others, b) whether correcting over-estimates of others’ gender unequal attitudes changes own reported gender attitudes, and c) whether the type of person/role model that one is given information on differentially affects how much own gender attitudes change."
