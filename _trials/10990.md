abstract: "We want to analyze how feedback affects social behavior in a lab experiment. The experiment will be run in Palma (Illes Balears, Spain).

Subjects will play two rounds of a dictator game. They receive a 10 euros endowment in each round (one of the two rounds will be randomly chosen to determine the payment). In each round, subjects have to decide how much money they keep for themselves and how much money they donate to an NGO. The amount they decide to donate will be actually transferred to an NGO while the amount subjects' keep for themselves will be part of their individual payment. 

The experiment aims to see how subjects react to normative and Kantian feedback once potential effects over beliefs are considered. In addition, it seeks to identify moderating effects. To do so, subjects will play two rounds of a dictatorship game under three different treatments: A control treatment, an informative treatment in which subjects gain information about others' behavior, and a normative (Kantian) treatment in which each subject will learn the aggregate effects that there would be if all the participants in the experiment would behave in the same way as her."
