abstract: "The aim is to make a test to assess social intelligence of people and social deficit in autistic patients by using tests of “Theory of mind” (understanding others' mental states, resulting in difficulties in understanding one's beliefs, desires, intentions, feelings and interpreting the behavior of others). Hinting task and reading the mind in the eyes test are taken to study and to introduce adaptations to make a test which can be used as a diagnostic tool to assess social deficit in autistic patients. We aim to make two visual versions of the hinting task, one with face masks and one without face masks to assess social cognitions and facial expression perception which will assess verbal and nonverbal social deficit in patients. The main objective of this study is to make a social intelligence test by introducing these changes and then testing it to know if it can assess social deficit. "
