abstract: "Strong intergenerational associations in wealth have fueled a long-standing debate over why students of low-income parents tend to have on average lower incentives to be highly educated. Understanding the role of preferences, attitudes, and future expectations according to social background seems crucial in the students’ decision to invest in higher education. Perceptions about the consumption value of education may explain a substantial share of the variation in students’ ability to prosecute their study, influencing their probability of finding a job. For this purpose, we conducted a randomized control experiment with university students in Emilia-Romagna who benefit from the financial aid program offered by the regional public system. We want to explore what type of message is more effective in eliciting aid recipients’ attitudes and expectations. In particular, we compare messages stressing the importance of receiving public grants compared to the role of education in terms of career success. We can document whether or not students’ beliefs about the consumption value of tertiary education predict students’ beliefs compared to how likely public grants may help obtain the necessary grades to proceed into the labor market stage with a more significant probability of success. Differences in the perceived consumption value of education across gender and socio-economic groups can account for a large proportion of the gender and socio-economic gaps both in students’ intentions to select some jobs as well as in their perceptions about their performance. In this direction, a spatial regression evaluation can be derived based on the geographical residence of the students’ families."
