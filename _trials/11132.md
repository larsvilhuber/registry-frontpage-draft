abstract: "In the experimental literature, social norms are identified  by using the method developed by Krupka and Weber (2013). 
We plan to replicate the Krupka and Weber experimental design for eliciting social norms using coordination games with a simple modification to test whether this modification leads to similar or different elicited norms."
