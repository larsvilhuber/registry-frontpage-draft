abstract: "In AEA #AEARCTR-0008053, we describe a survey experiment conducted with landlords in Memphis, TN. To complement that study, we collect baseline measures of altruism (using our modified dictator game) and beliefs about evictions from two external samples: (i) a sample of people in Memphis, TN, and (ii) a nationally representative sample. We intend to compare behavior in the external sample to the behavior in the landlord sample. "
