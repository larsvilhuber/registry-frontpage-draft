abstract: "MSME capabilities can be more effectively improved with customized programs such as mentoring or peer interactions. But we lack evidence on how the government can implement and scale such programs. To make progress, we study a government-run small-group mentoring program provided to thousands of MSMEs each year in Depok City, Indonesia. We introduce three randomized interventions to 2,200 firms and 63 mentors. (1) We randomize admittance to evaluate whether a government-run program can achieve similar gains as researcher-run programs. (2) We improve the government’s delivery capacity by training and monitoring mentors, to study the effect of state capacity on program effectiveness. (3) We enhance content on marketing practices, to evaluate the effect of providing content demanded specifically by the MSMEs. The results can help design scalable programs that meaningfully improve MSME performance. "
