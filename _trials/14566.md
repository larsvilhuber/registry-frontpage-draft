abstract: "This project examines how intergroup preferences among U.S. consumers with different political affiliations influence their macroeconomic expectations, using a large-scale online survey. We collect data on consumers' political affiliations and their perceptions of the U.S. Federal Reserve's political leaning. Our analysis focuses on the heterogeneity in expectation formation between consumers who view the Fed as either an outgroup or ingroup institution, including their behavior in acquiring and processing communications from the Fed."
