abstract: "The screening of job applicants using data-driven technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) has grown rapidly in the U.S. and is starting to pick up pace in Europe. We aim to study the decision process of job-applicants when offered a choice between algorithmic and human evaluation, using a behavioral experiment. An emerging literature suggests that such algorithmic screening technologies are indeed valuable hiring tools for Ô¨Årms. However, concerns are being raised that algorithmic screening technologies may perpetuate or exacerbate existing labor market biases, exclude vulnerable groups from the labor market, provide no legal basis for appeals, and are poorly understood by the people judged by them (Barocas and Selbst, 2016). We study how job-applicants perceive and value algorithmic vs. human screening, and how they change their behavior in response to algorithmic settings. These questions have so far been neglected.

We would like to answer the following questions: Do job applicants prefer to be evaluated by an algorithmic or by a human recruiter? Which demographic characteristics, perceptions, and attitudes are correlated with this choice? Are job applicants willing to pay to change the recruiting method they have been assigned to? Does job applicants' skill level correlate with their choice of a recruiter?
