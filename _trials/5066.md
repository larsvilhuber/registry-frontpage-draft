abstract: "In a previous study, we conducted a randomized experiment to test whether consumersâ€™ willingness to accept, elicited in an incentivized auction (BDM), increases when they are informed that a product is produced in a socially and environmentally sustainable way. We find a significant increase. However, our design does not allow us to disentangle if the increase is driven by the social sustainability-related aspects of the environmental sustainability-related aspects of the production. In this project, we replicate the methodological approach of our previous study but alter the information consumers receive. To be able to answer the question if consumers care more about the social or environmental impact of the production of goods, we either inform them about social sustainability-related aspects or environmental sustainability-related aspects of the production, but not about both simultaneously.
