abstract: "The evaluation of the LifeSet program will follow a sample of youth randomized to be offered the LifeSet program or, alternatively, services as usual. The LifeSet program focuses on supporting youth in successful transitions to independent living by providing supports and services in multiple domains of independent living. The program is structured around a core relationship between each youth and their assigned “LifeSet specialist” who works intensively with the youth throughout his or her time in the program.  

This evaluation will study both program impacts as well as program implementation, and will draw on qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis techniques. The goal of the evaluation is to determine whether LifeSet has significant impacts on key youth outcomes in New Jersey and will address the core evaluation question: does LifeSet have a causal impact on the well-being and successful transition to adulthood of youth in the target population? The primary research questions for the impact study are does LifeSet improve outcomes of target population youth in the domains of:  

a.	Connections to education and employment 
b.	Social connections 
c.	Housing stability 
d.	Youth well-being (including resilience and social-emotional competence) 

The eligible population for LifeSet will include youth 17-21 years old who have an open New Jersey public child welfare agency (DCF) case, are in the custody or guardianship of DCF, are living in the community (i.e. not incarcerated, in residential treatment, or hospitalized), and do not have a disqualifying condition (e.g., serious violent criminal history, residence out of state, severe mental illness, or intellectual disability). 

The target population for the LifeSet program includes many more individuals who are in need of, and are eligible for, the intervention than can be accommodated by the program’s limited slots. The evaluation will therefore allocate the limited program slots by lottery, which is a fair way to allocate scarce resources. Identification and randomization of target-age youth will be done by New Jersey DCF based on administrative records and information gathered from youths’ case workers. To prevent one LifeSet provider from randomly having all youth in their catchment area assigned to only one group, randomization will be stratified by provider catchment area using a 1T:1C ratio. We estimate that the program will be able to serve approximately 300 study-enrolled youth during a two-year intake period. With a 1:1 randomization ratio (1 treatment to 1 control, or 1T:1C), the evaluation design will provide us with a sample of 600 youth.
