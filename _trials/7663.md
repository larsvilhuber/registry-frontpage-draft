abstract: "The application is a test of six formats for interactive phone calls to parents of first-graders in 108 primary schools in Kenya that encourage reading at home through short exercises. Each experimental wave carries out biweekly calls during one half of term 3 of the Kenyan school year and uses the exploration sampling algorithm in wave 2 of the experiment to identify the call with the highest rate of call engagement, that is, the listener starts the reading exercises."
