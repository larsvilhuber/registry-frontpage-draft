abstract: "Girls and boys in developing countries are often exposed to a number of traditional practices that have strong, negative effects on their future, like for example child marriage and sexual initiation rituals. The measurement of the prevalence of these harmful traditional practices is particularly difficult due to social desirability biases and thus, reliable evidence is scarce. 

This research project measures the prevalence of different harmful traditional practices in Malawi, while explicitly accounting for social desirability bias by using a combination of advanced elicitation techniques. This not only provides us with an individual-specific measure for susceptibility to social pressure, but also allows us test interventions intended to mitigate these social forces. 

Further, we shed light on underlying behavioral mechanisms behind harmful traditional practices. In particular, we test the hypothesis that families take part in harmful traditional practices for the purpose of social signaling."
