abstract: "This document proposes a study to examine pre-service teachers’ (PSTs) valuations of internship amenities in Salvador, Brazil, through the lens of the Pedagogical Support and Activities Program (PAAP). Despite PAAP’s potential to benefit both student learning and PST development through active tutoring roles, the program currently operates below capacity, filling only about 800 of 1,500 available positions. Using survey data and a discrete choice experiment, we investigate the questions: how do PSTs value different internship amenities such as salary, schedule flexibility, and internship quality? Our findings will inform the Municipal Secretary of Education’s (Secretaria Municipal de Educação, SMED) efforts to improve PAAP recruitment and contribute to the broader literature on how PSTs value internship amenities. This research has immediate policy implications for the design of teacher training programs and adds to our understanding of PST preferences when determining where to complete student-teaching experiences."
