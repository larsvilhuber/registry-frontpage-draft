abstract: "Many reasons for ”inconsistent” preferences for risks have been proposed. A leading explanation,
incompleteness, is notoriously elusive to measure using choice data. Therefore, we devise an experiment to
test the degree of indecisiveness in individuals’ choices over lotteries. To elicit the degree of indecisiveness,
we present subjects with a series of choice lists and allow them to defer some of their choices. With this
procedure, we elicit the range of choices for which they are unsure. Eliciting these ranges allows us to
elicit utility as a range rather than a single value. Hence, subjects’ preferences may be represented by a
multi-utility representation and exhibit indecisiveness. Further, we can test how well a multi-weighted
utility representation can summarize their observed choices. We also explore whether framing choices as
losses or gains affects the ranges of indecision. The data collected will test the incompleteness hypothesis."
