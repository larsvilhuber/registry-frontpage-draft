abstract: "This study aims at eliciting beliefs about the return to effort and to different study habits in College. The purpose is to look into effective ways to enhance student learning in and outside the classrooms and close the achievement gap between students from different backgrounds (e.g., first generation students). In order to do so, we aim to collect information from students on their current study habits when preparing for exams (ex: how early before the exam do they study, what study tasks do they implement) and then give them tips and advice on how to study effectively.
