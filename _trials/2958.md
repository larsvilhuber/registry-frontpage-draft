abstract: "The value-added tax (VAT) is one of the most important sources of domestic tax revenue in developing countries. In theory, the VAT has two desirable properties: it is more efficient than alternative tax instruments, and it is self-enforcing because the two sides of each transaction (seller and buyer) have incentives to report truthfully. However, when enforcement capacity is limited, these two properties can break down, leading to economic distortions and tax revenue losses. When cross-checking the transactions reported monthly by all VAT-registered firms in Uganda in the period 2015-2017, we estimated substantial discrepancies leading to a large revenue shortfall. 
This experiment aims to improve compliance along the VAT chain through the implementation of a tax enforcement intervention that encourages taxpayers to amend their past tax returns and comply with tax laws in the future. Specifically, the treatment will consist of sending notification letters to about 1,000 randomly selected firm-pairs (i.e., buyer-seller pairs) with the following information: (i) their VAT returns will be closely monitored (ii) a list of up to 3 discrepancies that have been found in their past returns (iii) failure to comply could result in additional enforcement measures or prosecution. We will measure the direct effect of the letters on the tax compliance behavior of the treated firms, and also the spillover effects on their trading partners.
