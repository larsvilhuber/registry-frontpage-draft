abstract: "We designed an original survey instrument to study the impact of the floods that heavily hit Emilia Romagna and Tuscany in 2023, and the preparedness to extreme climatic events. The goal of the study is to assess how extreme climatic events affected individualsâ€™ choices and future prospects, including preparedness to future extreme climatic events."
