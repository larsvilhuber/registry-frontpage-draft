abstract: "This project will use a new educational technology to examine the effect of study planning interventions on student effort and outcomes. The setting is a first-year academic course in economics with a large and diverse student population. The educational technology enables precise measurement of study time during this course. These data will be subsequently used to construct personalized feedback that helps students to track real-time progress relative to their initial study goals and plans (elicited during weekly in-class surveys).  We will evaluate whether the planning interventions improve student effort and learning outcomes (as captured by the performance on the final exam)."
