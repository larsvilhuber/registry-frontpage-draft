abstract: "Telehealth platforms have emerged in many settings in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis where restrictions on movement prevented traditional face-to-face modes of care. Telehealth  platforms have the potential to significantly reduce the cost required to receive medical advice, and expand the availability of providers in resource constrained settings such as South Africa. However, little is known about consumers' willingness-to-pay for such services and whether design characteristics including effort required to identify a provider and secure an appointment might impact demand for these services. To address this need, we use a multiple price list mechanism to elicit willingness-to-pay for telehealth primary care consultations where patients are randomly assigned to differing modes of provider choice."
