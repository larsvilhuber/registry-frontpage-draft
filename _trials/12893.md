abstract: "This study explores how consumers perceive Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in comparison with traditional financial instruments, focusing on the dual role of CBDC as a liquidity asset and a payment method. Through a survey experiment conducted with 3,000 participants, we investigate the distinction between CBDC as a liquidity asset versus a payment method and how awareness of its security and ecosystem might alter consumer preferences and usage patterns.
