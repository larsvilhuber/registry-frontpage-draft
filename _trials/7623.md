abstract: "We all have many identities whether it be our gender, age/cohort, class, political affiliation, race, religion or dietary preferences. There is a large literature on the role of identity in decision-making but most of them focus on scenarios where identity is uni-dimensional.  In this study, we focus instead on scenarios where identity may be multi-dimensional. In particular, we seek to examine how the number of salient dimensions of identity may cause shifts in the strength of identities and hence behavior."
