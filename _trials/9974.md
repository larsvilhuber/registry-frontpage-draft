abstract: "The common consequence (CC) and common ratio (CR) effects are two prominent violations of expected utility (EU). Both were originally proposed as thought experiments by Allais (1953), and later popularized by Kahneman and Tversky (1979) .The goal of this manuscript is to fill a gap in the literature by providing connected CC and CR problems over a diverse range of parametric configurations and measuring underlying preferences."
