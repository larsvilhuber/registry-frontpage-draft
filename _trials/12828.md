abstract: "In 2008, the Japanese government launched a new health checkup system, the Specified Health Examination. The purpose of this checkup is to screen pre-diabetic patients who are at risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus, and to provide early intervention for receiving medical treatment and improving lifestyle. The uptake rate in FY2020 was 53.4%, compared to the government’s target of 70%. The uptake rate for National Health Insurance subscribers, which includes self-employed people, was only 33.7%.

In this study, we collaborate with a Japanese local government and conduct two experiments focusing on the channels (postal mail and SMS) used to send reminder messages to encourage National Health Insurance subscribers to receive health checkups. In one experiment, we measure the effects of two reminder messages based on behavioral economics and nudge through the postal mail channel. In the other experiment, we compare the effect of sending a reminder message through the postal mail channel with that of sending it through the SMS channel.

The subjects of this experiment (around 40,000 citizens) are the National Health Insurance subscribers in the age group eligible for the Specified Health Examination in FY2023. In addition, they have not received the checkups by the time the postcards are mailed. First, we divide 40,000 citizens into two groups: the subjects of Experiment 1 (around 28,000 citizens) and the subjects of Experiment 2 (around 11,000 citizens). The former are citizens whose mobile phone numbers are not known by the local government and to whom SMS cannot be sent. The latter are citizens whose mobile phone numbers are known to the local government and to whom SMS can be sent. Second, in Experiment 1, we randomly assign around 28,000 citizens to the following three groups at individual level:

- Control group 1A: We mail a postcard explaining the necessity of the specific health examination and how to make an appointment. 
- Treatment group 1B: We add the message "Do you still have your free voucher for the specific health examination?" to the control group's postcard and then introduce a simple way to reissue the voucher.
- Treatment group 1C: We add the message "Your voucher for health checkup is about to expire" to the control group's postcard and then call for early reservations.

In Experiment 2, we randomly assign around 11,000 citizens to the following three groups at individual level:

- Control group 2A: No reminder
- Treatment group 2B: We send a reminder message through the postal mail channel.
- Treatment group 2C: We send a reminder message through the SMS channel.

We will send the postcards in January 2024. The outcome variables are the presence or absence and timing of the health checkup from the first mailing time to the end of March 2024."
