abstract: "We propose to investigate the effects of child marriage law on marriage customs making use of (i) a new child marriage law in Bangladesh with separate progressive and regressive components, (ii) an existing nationally representative survey on women in Bangladesh with information on attitudes towards traditional marriage practices conducted immediately before the start of public debates that led to the new child marriage law, and (iii) a proposed exogenous treatment aimed at accelerating knowledge transmission about the new law in rural areas.
