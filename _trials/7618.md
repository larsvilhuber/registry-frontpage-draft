abstract: "While online learning environments are increasingly common, relatively little is known about classroom interactions in these settings. We test for the presence of race and gender biases among students and instructors in asynchronous online classes by measuring responses to discussion comments posted in the discussion forums of 124 different online courses. Each comment was randomly assigned a student name connoting a specific race and gender. "
