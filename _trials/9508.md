abstract: "Social norms are sometimes misperceived, which has consequences for important
economic outcomes. However, little is known about why misperceptions exist in the first place. This project
focuses on the role of communication in shaping misperceptions, which I study in the context of masculinity
norms among 7th to 9th graders in urban Brazil, in collaboration with the Secretariat of Education of the
City of Rio. The study assigns treatment children to discussion groups to learn peers’ opinions about two
traditional beliefs about masculinity: men who cry are weak and men should use violence to get respect if necessary. To further investigate different types of communicators, half of treatment discussion groups allow children to volunteer to speak (vocal group) and half of treatment discussion groups randomly pre-select students to be invited to share (representative group). Control discussion groups focus on a masculinity-neutral topic (recycling)."
