abstract: "While a growing body of programs have shown promise to increase uptake of postpartum family planning (PPFP) among first time mothers (FTMs), difficulties remain in scaling beyond small pilot areas and institutionalizing within existing systems. Likewise, despite the importance of post-natal care (PNC), it remains a neglected area within the maternal and newborn health continuum of care in many areas around the world. Programs working to improve coverage of PNC and postnatal home visits (PNHVs) have faced difficulties with insufficient human resources and health systems, suggesting a need for prioritization of care in settings with limited human resources. Connect’s approach aims to strengthen existing government health systems and community-level health efforts, including those supported through local and international non-governmental organizations, by developing and testing light-touch “enhancements” with the goal of increasing PPFP and PNC uptake among FTMs. We will evaluate Connect's approach through a cluster randomized control trial."
