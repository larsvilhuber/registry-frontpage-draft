abstract: "Youth homelessness is a significant problem in New South Wales, Australia, where young people aged 15 to 24 years constitute a substantial share of Specialist Homelessness Services clients. This is especially concerning because homelessness itself has significant impacts on young people's education, physical and mental health, as well as involvement in social networks. 
The Premier’s Youth Initiative is a major undertaking developed by the New South Wales Department of Family and Community Services (FACS) that aims to prevent homelessness among at-risk young people leaving care and divert them from the homelessness service system altogether.
The Initiative service model has been designed to provide a combination of personal advice, education and employment mentoring, transitional accommodation support and long-term accommodation. At the core of the initiative is the concept of a personal advisor who can co-ordinate adolescents' transition from care into adulthood.
This evaluation will employ a randomised controlled trial design, in which eligible participants are allocated to either receive the Premier's Youth Initiative (the treatment condition) or FACS's Business As Usual (BAU) services (the control condition). The intervention will be compared to FACS’s usual service offering for youth leaving the out-of-home care system. The use of a randomised experimental design is an important part of this project, as it will provide the most robust evidence in a field where little evaluation currently takes place."
