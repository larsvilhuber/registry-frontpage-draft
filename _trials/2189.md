abstract: "Globalization and technological innovation compound the need for schools to prepare students for college, career, and citizenship in the 21st century. To transfer their skills, knowledge, and attitudes to new contexts, students must learn deeply to develop the ability to think and communicate in sophisticated ways, demonstrate creativity and innovation, and learn adaptively. Yet learning course content through the traditional, and currently predominant, “transmission” mode of instruction – in which teachers lecture while students take notes, memorize content, and restate content in multiple-choice assessments – is not an effective way to learn deeply. Through the Knowledge in Action (KIA) project-based approach to Advanced Placement (AP) teaching and learning, students actively engage in teacher- and student-posed learning challenges (i.e., projects) rather than playing a passive role. The goals of the KIA Efficacy Study are to 1) test the hypothesis that the KIA project-based learning approach to AP U.S. Government and AP Environmental Science leads to improved or “deeper” student learning, interpersonal and intrapersonal skills, and civic engagement and 2) identify factors that correlate with successful KIA implementation, such as support from districts, schools, the KIA professional development provider, and professional learning communities. The KIA Efficacy Study examines the impact of a one-year intervention. The KIA Maturation Study evaluates the impact of a second year of KIA.
