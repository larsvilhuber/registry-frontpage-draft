abstract: "The intervention is a quite intensive summer camp, targeted on low achieving students in primary schools and lasting about one month, during school summer break. Its main aim is supporting achievement for students highly affected by COVID19 pandemic, due to their prior low education performances and to lack of strong parental support.
The project involves three primary scools in Milan, all enrolling mainly students from lower social origins and with migratory background. The summer camp is organized in three locations (one for each primary school) and delivers both support with holiday homeworks and entertaining activities for children, such as outdoor games, team sport competitions, theater, etc. Children aged around 8 to 10, are called to attend 4 hours of activities 5 days a week, for 4 weeks, and are supervised by trained educators.
School teachers proposed 156 low achieving students, attending grades 3 to 5, on the basis of their need of support.
Pupils were assessed - with all their classmates - before the intervention, through ad hoc standardized tests in reading and math. Pupils were also  asked to fill a questionnaire collecting information on their social background and their attitudes towards school and achievement.
Pupils were sorted in 17 groups (randomization blocks) based on schools/grades/performance in pre-intervention test (above/before the median). Pupils were individually randomized to treatment (participation to the summer camp, 83 cases) or control group (73 cases). "
