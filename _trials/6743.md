abstract: "This online survey experiment has two objectives. First, to study how individuals update their inflation expectations. Second, to examine how these inflation expectations affect policy preferences and preferences for redistribution. Bayesian learning models are typically used when studying expectations, however the endogenous nature of individual's updating has not yet been addressed. We will launch a large-scale online survey experiment across 17 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean."
