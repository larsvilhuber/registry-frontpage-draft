abstract: "In many low-income countries, few deaths are recorded with civil registration systems. Instead, vital statistics about mortality are computed from data collected every 3-5 years during large-scale household surveys. Unfortunately, such surveys are too infrequent to detect short-term fluctuations in mortality. They are also often postponed or interrupted during epidemics because they present transmission risks (e.g., during in-person interviews, large-scale trainings or cross-country travel). In this project, we will test whether survey data on mortality can be collected remotely by mobile phone. Surveys of mobile phone subscribers are increasingly common in low-income countries. They can be conducted more frequently than household surveys. They also present more limited transmission risks during epidemics. However, surveys of mobile subscribers have seldom included questions about mortality, in large part due to concerns that participants might not be willing to discuss recent deaths in their family during a phone call, or that the survey questions might generate negative feelings (e.g., sadness, distress). We will work in Malawi, a low-income country in southeastern Africa.  We will recruit a random sample of mobile phone subscribers aged 18-64 years old. Among those, some participants will be randomly allocated to an interview about family deaths, whereas others will be asked to complete a commonly used questionnaire on economic activity. We will then test whether participation and completion rates are lower when the interview focuses on mortality, and we will assess whether respondents experience more negative feelings when completing an interview about family deaths. Results from this study will help develop a new method for tracking mortality in real-time in low-income countries with limited data collection systems"
