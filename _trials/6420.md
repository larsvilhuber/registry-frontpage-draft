abstract: "Objectives: Stress   influences   metabolic activity and increases risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Little is known regarding the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of stress reduction in older adults at risk for CVD. a) To examine feasibility and acceptability of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in older adults at risk for CVD, and b) obtain preliminary data on the metabolic impact of MBSR.

Methods:   A pilot RCT was conducted using a pre-post and 2-month follow-up design. Eighty-one individuals who met criteria for metabolic syndrome and exhibited non-normative responses to stress in a previous investigation were invited to participate. Participants were randomized (by sex and stress response) to a 9-week MBSR or a wait-list control group. Feasibility was assessed via response and recruitment rates; acceptability via program attendance, completion rate, and questionnaire. ANOVAs were conducted using metabolic parameter change scores with Grouping (MBSR or waitlist control) as a between-subjects factor.   Within-group changes were measured via one-way repeated measures ANOVA. 

Results: Thirty-three individuals (41%) responded to the invitations, 26 were interested, of whom 19 were randomized. Completion rate of MBSR was 68% and overall attendance was 97 %. Reported benefits of MBSR included increased relaxation, greater connection with loved ones, and increased body awareness. MBSR led to a decrease of 15% in LDL and 10% in cholesterol versus 4.5% and 1%, respectively in the waitlist. Within group analyses showed notable decreases in LDL, triglycerides, and waist circumference (η2=0.15-0.39) post-MBSR and 2 months later.

Conclusions: A RCT was largely feasible and MBSR acceptable to participants.  Preliminary evidence suggests that MBSR may lead to sustained decreases in cholesterol levels, warranting development of further large-scale research on this topic. "
