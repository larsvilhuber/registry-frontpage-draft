abstract: "This study assesses the potential value of incorporating AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT in the agrifood systems policymaking process. The study focuses on the International Food Policy Research Institute's (IFPRI) Country Strategy Support Programs (CSSPs) in the Global South across twelve study countries (Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Ghana, Malawi, Nigeria, India, Sudan, Tajikistan, Uganda and Bangladesh). The study will assess the quality and perceptions of policy notes in the context of relevant issues for development, as determined by IFPRI’s participating country offices. The study seeks to answer three research questions; 1) For policymakers, policy analysts, and other stakeholders in low- and middle-income countries, how does the perceived quality of and intended engagement with policy notes differ between policy notes written entirely by researchers and policy notes written primarily by generative AI bots?;  2) To what extent does the disclosure of the use of AI in writing policy notes influence policymakers’, policy analysts’, and other stakeholders' perceived quality of and intended engagement with policy notes?; 3) What are policymakers', policy analysts', and other stakeholders' beliefs about others’ perceptions of quality and intended engagement with AI-generated and human-written policy notes?
