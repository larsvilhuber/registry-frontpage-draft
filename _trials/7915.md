abstract: "This study investigates a state-wide Covid-19 response strategy that leverages a remote-learning solution to teach students while government-run schools remain closed (Haryana's “Ghar se Padhao” program). In a cluster-randomized trial, 80 schools receive the program without additional support (“control group”). Another 160 schools receive the program with additional support, helping teachers and students engage with the technology-enabled learning materials (“encouragement group”). Of these 160 schools, a random 80 had received an in-classroom blended-teaching program, in the previous school year. This research offers causal evidence on the effectiveness of a large-scale effort to avert learning loss, and on potential complementarities of home-based learning solutions with prior exposure to educational technology."
