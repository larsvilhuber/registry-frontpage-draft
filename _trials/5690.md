abstract: "The role of information is very evident and spans all the steps of decision making as depicted above. One of the key factors that compromise optimal decision making of farmers is the lack of credible information (Aker, 2011a; Fafchamps & Minten, 2012b; Jensen, 2007). It is often argued that the govt. organized extension programs suffer from poor planning, formulation, and execution (Ali & Kumar, 2011; Glendenning & Ficarelli, 2012). They fail to respond to the needs of the community, further their reach is very minimal (Glendenning et al., 2010). As an alternative, the role of ICTâ€™s as a medium and source of information dissemination is slowly gaining popularity all over the world (Ali & Kumar, 2011; Beaman et al., 2014; Rao, 2007). We propose to use the intervention of text reminders in our study to nudge the farmer into using a mobile phone application. We hypothesize that this nudge would lead to a shift from using less credible sources of information to more credible sources of information thereby enhancing the decision-making capabilities of the farmer.
