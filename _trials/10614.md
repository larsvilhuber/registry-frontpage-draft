abstract: "Intergenerational equity is a problem in our world.  We consume too many resources today and the current way of living is not sustainable. How to help people avoid short-sightedness and increase their concern for the future? Some scholars use future design to find mechanisms to make people care about long-run problems.  We study how the imaginary trip to the future as a mechanism will affect people's attitudes toward future generations. Using an imaginary trip to the future, we measure if it affects people's discount rate and also people's contribution to climate change mitigation. "
