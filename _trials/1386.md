abstract: "We are using large administrative data sets and randomized experiments to understand and improve outcomes in private sector unions. We randomize postcards sent to union members following a successful campaign. Treatment postcards invite them to participate in a membership meeting and contain information about past participation in union activities of their co-workers, co-union members, or themselves. We also randomize the fraction of coworkers of a particular shop that receive the treatment to estimate spillovers. We use administrative data from the union to measure participation in the membership meeting on June 22nd, participation in future events, contribution to the union political action fund, and eventual retention."
