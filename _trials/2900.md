abstract: "This study uses a government housing lottery to study the effect of low-cost housing, delivered in large, sprawling housing estates, on households that win the housing. We collect baseline and follow up data such that the study emulates the design a randomized controlled trial, for which the Government of Ethiopia plays the role of randomizer. The objective of the study is to provide evidence on two main questions: First, does state delivered, subsidized formal housing have the intended consequences of improving housing consumption and housing investments among beneficiary households? Second, does the construction of large-scale housing estates have unintended negative consequences that will make cities worse places to live? In particular, does winning formal housing in isolated housing estates have impacts on labour supply, communities and social networks?"
