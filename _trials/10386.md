abstract: "The project seeks to quantify the uncertainty in peoples' belief of their health related risk, assess how information will change the uncertainty in people's such beliefs, and identify how the uncertainty in people's health related beliefs affect their decision to pursue medical test and preventative care. The study will be conducted in the context of breast cancer and mammograms for women over the age of 35."
