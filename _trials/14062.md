abstract: "Improving the educational practice in vocational education with the best practice in the industry is a priority for the Indonesian Ministry of Education. Vocational high schools in Indonesia enroll one-half of all upper-secondary level students, but its graduates have the the highest open unemployment rate compared to graduates from other types of education.

To address this issue, in 2020, the Directorate General of Vocational Education (MitrasDUDI-MOECRT) collaborated with various industries and launched an innovative professional teacher development program to improve teachersâ€™ skills in their respective vocational fields (e.g., software engineering, elderly care, and animation). Previous evidence shows intensive and structured professional development can yield significant impact, but there is limited evidence on the impact of structured teacher training for both developing countries and post-primary vocational education and on the role of the private sector in training. This study will evaluate the impact of the training.
