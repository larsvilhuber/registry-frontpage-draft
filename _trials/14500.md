abstract: "In this study, we examine how emotions and status quo bias impact common value elections. Many political decisions involve the choice between maintaining an existing status quo or voting for change. This is particularly true of referendums and elections. A handful of empirical studies have suggested that voting for the status quo is positively associated with negative emotions. In this study, we explore this relationship between negative emotions and status quo bias using emotion induction techniques in an incentivized election game. We do this using an online experiment based on a between-subjects design, comprising nine treatments. In all treatments, individuals complete a simple incentivized real-effort task, and then are given an opportunity to vote in a common value election on one of two payment plans to determine their payoffs in a second real-effort task. In the status quo treatments, the payment plan from the first task is presented as the default status quo option, which they can vote to either keep or change. In the baseline conditions, the status quo payment plan is not known, and no status quo framing is used in the election. In the emotion induction treatments, participants are shown short clips from movies prior to voting which are designed to induce specific emotions. We explore how the status quo bias impacts participantsâ€™ behaviour in incentivized elections and whether or not certain emotional states further exaggerate preferences for retaining the status quo.
