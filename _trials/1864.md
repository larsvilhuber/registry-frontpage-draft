abstract: "Interest towards science and technology has been declining in the past twenty years and inquiry-based teaching might be a good way to reinforce science interest at the earliest age. The literature on the inquiry-based education is large but it is mostly based on small scale trials or on very specific cases (summer schools…). We use a randomized experiment to investigate the impacts of a large scale inquiry-based training program in three regions of France delivered to primary school teachers, on teaching practices and student outcomes. Among voluntary teachers, the treatment group receives an 80 hours training program over two years, while the control group receives very little or no training. We estimate impacts on multiple outcomes: teaching practices and student’s knowledge, reasoning skills and interest and motivation toward science and technology. "
