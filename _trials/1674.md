abstract: "The federal welfare overhaul of 1996 ushered in myriad policy changes aimed at getting low-income parents off public assistance and into employment. These changes--especially cash welfare's transformation from an entitlement into a time-limited benefit contingent on work participation--have intensified the need to help low-income families become economically self-sufficient and remain so in the long term. Although a fair amount is known about how to help welfare recipients prepare for and find jobs in the first place, the Employment Retention and Advancement (ERA) project was a comprehensive effort to discover what approaches help--and do not help--welfare recipients and other low-income people stay steadily employed and advance in their jobs. The ERA project, which tested 15 programs around the country, was conducted by MDRC, under contract to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, with additional funding from the U.S. Department of Labor.

In this part of the study, a program in Texas aimed to promote job placement, employment retention, and advancement among applicants and recipients in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. To encourage employment retention and advancement among working TANF leavers, the Texas ERA program provided job search assistance, pre- and postemployment case management, and a monthly stipend of $200 to individuals who retained their jobs. The program was evaluated in three Texas sites--Corpus Christi, Fort Worth, and Houston--starting in 2000. Using random assignment, eligible individuals were assigned either to a program group, whose members participated in the ERA program, or to a control group, whose members participated in Texas's standard welfare-to-work program (called "Choices"). Employment and earnings data (as well as other data) were collected for individuals in both groups (n=4,288) over a four-year post-random assignment period. A comparison of the outcomes for the two groups indicates the effectiveness of the Texas ERA program.

Texas ERA findings at a glance:
--Served unemployed TANF applicants and recipients
--Provided a financial incentive for employment retention for those leaving TANF for work, coupled with job search assistance and postemployment services (including reemployment assistance and visits to working clients at their employer's site)
--Was well implemented in Corpus Christi but experienced some operational difficulties in Fort Worth and, particularly, in Houston
--Compared with the control group, programmatic differences related mostly to the postemployment services and the financial incentive (preemployment services were similar for the two research groups)
--Resulted in 30 percent receiving the financial incentive in Corpus Christi and approximately 20 percent doing so in the two other Texas sites
--Produced consistent impacts on employment retention and advancement outcomes in Corpus Christi, less consistent impacts in Fort Worth, and no impacts in Houston -- over a four-year follow-up period
--In Corpus Christi, the ERA program increased average annual earnings by $640, or by 15% of control group earnings, over the four-year follow-up period. The ERA program in Corpus Christi produced gains in earnings through the end of the four-year period, even after program group members would have lost eligibility for the stipends and services. In fact, the Corpus Christi program had its largest effect on earnings in the fourth year, suggesting the possibility that the program may have produced to even longer-term gains.  "
