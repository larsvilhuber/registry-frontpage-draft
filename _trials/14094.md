abstract: "We investigate how changes in migrant stocks as opposed to migrant flows affect political outcomes in the United States. We collect respondentsâ€™ quantitative estimates of the shares of the population that they consider migrant stocks as compared to migrant inflows, which we define as people who arrived in the last two years in the US and came from other countries to live in the US. We delineate five randomized experimental groups, to check whether the correlations between immigration perceptions and political attitudes are causal. Specifically, we provide the treatment groups with information on the actual shares of migrant stocks or migrant flows. We also present two different hypothetical future scenarios of the change of these respective figures. We collect detailed information on respondents concerns about the future situation of the country and their political preferences. We further collate information on individuals contact with foreign-born people as well as their media consumption."
