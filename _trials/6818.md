abstract: "Academic self-concept is long hypothesized to drive students’ deceptive behavior – though there are few experimental tests of this hypothesis. Our aim with this experiment is to fill this gap. We ask how students’ randomly induced academic self-concept affects their engagement with deception. We define deception as intended misreporting of data to obtain a more valuable outcome – a behavior that has relevant consequences in the context of education. "
