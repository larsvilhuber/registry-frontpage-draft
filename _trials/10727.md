abstract: "Central bank communication has been used as a monetary policy tool to - amongst others - influence inflation expectations. This paper studies whether the source (i.e. the messenger) of central bank communication matters for communication to be effective. Further, this trial looks into the existence of potential "ingroup" effects, where the effectiveness of communication is altered because of shared attributes of the receiver and messenger of the communication.
