abstract: "In 2014, Colorado introduced regulations requiring oil and gas companies to identify and to fix methane leaks, and to install equipment to limit or prevent emissions. Yet firms and regulators might be unable to comprehensively monitor these emissions, and still rely on infrequent and expensive on-site facility inspections to detect leaks. This study plans to leverage predictive analytics and remote sensing technologies to test the effectiveness of new targeting and inspection strategies on reducing methane emissions."
