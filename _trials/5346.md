abstract: "We collaborate with a retail company and investigate changes in the salesworkers' compensation system. In an RCT, we study the effect of yearly target setting on performance. To that end, we introduce two new compensation systems. The first system is reset every month, whereas the second is reset only at the end of the year, leading to increased levels of commissions over time. We study how the different compensation systems affect revenues, turnover, conversion rates (i.e., the rate at which customers being served by salesworkers buy the firm's products), and granted discounts."
