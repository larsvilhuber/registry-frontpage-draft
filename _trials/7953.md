abstract: "Multiplicative risk vulnerability determines whether an individual behaves in a more risk averse way in the presence of a multiplicative background risk. We add a multiplicative background risk to a standard portfolio problem and check whether individuals behave in accordance with multiplicative risk vulnerability. We vary the skewness of the background risk in order to study whether individuals behave differently in the presence of a skewed background risk compared to a symmetric one. "
