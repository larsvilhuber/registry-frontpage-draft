abstract: "Populations in many countries have become decidedly more polarized over the last decades. Many believe that social media, which creates echo chamber-like interactions, is partly to blame. In principle, more intense communication between like-minded individuals can have two distinct impacts on political beliefs. First, individuals may receive a slanted diet of political news shared by their like-minded friends. Second, they may purposefully slant their own news consumption, and beliefs, in order to remain more in line with these friends. Despite the importance of these questions, there is little evidence for either of these two types of influences. This paper designs a unique field experiment on Twitter to separately identify both mechanisms. In our sample, politically-active individuals consume a highly slanted news diet. By varying what an individual’s social media followers see about her news diet and tracking their news consumption and sharing behavior, we test if (1) this news diet has an impact on individual behavior and beliefs; and more importantly, (2) whether individuals manipulate their news diet in order to remain more in line with their friends when they believe that their choices will be observed by these friends. This is either because they would like to signal to their friends via their news diet choices or because they are afraid of certain reactions when they deviate from a news diet aligned with their friends’ ideological position."
