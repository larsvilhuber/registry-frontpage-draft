abstract: "Social cohesion drives trust among community members and as such is key to economic development. A high influx of refugees might disrupt the links that social cohesion creates, as the arrival of foreigners may change social relations in the society. Therefore, how to construct social cohesion in refugee-receiving countries is both desirable and necessary for policy. We conduct a randomized control trial targeting refugee job seekers and local workers at firms managed by natives in Uganda. Drawing on insights from across the social sciences, we measure social cohesion through a compound measure incorporating attitudes, implicit and explicit biases, and behaviors in real and hypothetical activities. Does contact, through direct and indirect exposure in the workplace, promote social cohesion between refugees and natives? We find that while implicit bias increases, explicit bias decreases for both groups, and behaviors towards the out-group are positive for both groups but differ slightly: natives want to have more refugee business partners, while refugees want to work more for Ugandan firms."
