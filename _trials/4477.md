abstract: "The general objective of this study is to investigate variations in willingness-to-pay for time-saving lunch services in the context of the workday.   
The aim of this experiment is to determine whether changes in meal break duration, schedule leniency and time pressure affect willingness to pay for time-saving lunch services during the workday. Based on hypothetical scenarios, participants will be asked to state how much they would be willing to pay to reduce waiting time to get their lunch. "
