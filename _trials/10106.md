abstract: "This project examines the process of worker learning-by-doing within a data collection firm in Uganda. We partner with the organization to test if investments in frontline and digital supervision enhance worker performance and learning by aggregating and transmitting knowledge within the firm. We propose an experimental design to identify the causal effects of knowledge flows from supervisors on individual worker performance. In the experiment, we randomize the intensity of supervision and on-the-job training across workers and production tasks. We further examine if the effects of one-on-one training from supervisors are magnified by the transmission of knowledge across co-workers."
