abstract: "Alcohol misuse is associated with a number of harmful short and long term consequences for young people. Health campaigns that aim to educate people about these risks are often ineffective, possibly because consequences may be felt too far in the future, or they fail to account for the determinants of drinking for young people.  However, social image and reputation may be important concerns for young people (Gerrard et al, 2008).  Therefore, a focus on short term social consequences, rather than long term harms may be more appropriate in this population.  This study aims to explore the potential of two online interventions to reduce risky drinking and alcohol related harms in young people compared to controls.  Participants will be young people aged 18-30 who identify as drinking alcohol.  They will complete baseline measures about their drinking behaviours and psychological factors including measures of public and private self-consciousness and prototype perceptions.  They will then be randomised to one of four groups, two interventions and two control groups.  Four weeks later they will complete follow up measures.  Furthermore we will interview approximately 25 people to explore their views about the online interventions.  "
