abstract: "In a randomized online experiment, we investigate the racial minorities' responses to exogenous information about discrimination against own racial group. Specifically, our study examines the information effects on minorities' (i) respective beliefs, (ii) performance in a real-effort task, (iii) willingness to pay for race-blind determination of their earnings and (iv) decision to exaggerate own task performance. The experiment will be conducted with a large sample representative of the African American population residing in the United States. Subjects will be randomly divided into two subsets. Both groups will be asked for an incentivized guess about the number of White respondents from a previous survey who allocated at least the same amount to an African American person as they allocated to a White person. In the treatment arm, participants will subsequently see a true number based on the survey results. In the control group, the information stage will be omitted."
