abstract: "Under the numerous government-led initiatives to alleviate poverty, the Chinese rural communities and populations are viewed as passive receivers of government support. The rural communities lack the agency in addressing their public welfare demands such as social protection for an aging rural society. However, we currently observe a transition of the national strategy where the rural populations are encouraged to address the inadequate elderly care provision in a collaborative way.
Yet, little is known about rural Chinese farmers’ cooperative behaviors and tendencies toward intricate public goods, i.e., elderly care services. This problem represents a typical dilemma prevalent in Chinese rural societies where the traditional private approaches are no longer applicable to modern challenges created by urbanization and emigration. The increasing aging population and loss of the working-age population demand joint efforts within the rural community and between the government to create a public provision of elderly care services. This study will be the first to investigate the Chinese rural population’s cooperation in addressing elderly care problems with a lab-in-the-field experiment. In addition, the study will examine the impact of rewards and removal thereof on farmers’ cooperative behavior. The findings will provide valuable insights into the extent to which supportive policies can demotivate or motivate individual cooperation through different policy strategies.
Moreover, the study explores the underlying psychological mechanism of villagers' cooperation. We will examine the interactive relations between collective culture, opinions, and cooperation.  
In summary, the study will be the first lab-in-the-field experiment on real-life cooperation dilemmas of the aging Chinese rural population, laying the foundation for future research on Chinese farmers’ cooperation and the creation of social protection policies to address the challenges of an aging society. Through the intervention, we will examine the impact of different policy strategies on cooperation. Ultimately, the experiment will advance our understanding of collaboration dynamics and improve farmers’ agency in bottom-up development through additional tools for practitioners that are motivated by social psychology.
