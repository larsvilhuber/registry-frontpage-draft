abstract: "To our knowledge, there is no study examining the relationship between decision making on behalf of others and the source of the income. For this reason, we will in our thesis examine whether the degree of risk taking on behalf of others depends on the source of the income. The results of this research will contribute to the understanding of how people make risky decisions on behalf of others, which in particular could be interesting for explaining decisions made by - for example - hedge fund managers."
