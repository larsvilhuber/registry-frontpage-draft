abstract: "An understanding of crowd funding—an increasingly attractive alternative means of financing research and development—could assist effective campaign design. A randomized control trial online field experiment determined which participants donated toward the research and development of next-generation space power plants, and which of three intervention types facilitate donation: “matching”, “social pressure” and “matching & pressure”. Results indicate that: (1) all intervention types increased the donation rates significantly; (2) the total effects of “matching” and “pressure” surpassed the effect of “matching & pressure” for participants with low intrinsic motives, but not for participants with high intrinsic motives."
