abstract: "Commitment contracts have been shown to be effective to overcome time inconsistent health behavior, including physical activity. However, the take-up of these contracts is usually low.  According to several behavioral economic theories, including the quasi-hyperbolic model and dual-self models, the demand for commitment should be increasing in the individual's sophistication, or awareness of their time inconsistency problems.  We posit that an intervention to increase sophistication can boost the demand for commitment.  We also test the relation between the level of sophistication and the level of time inconsistent preferences (the extent to which an individual's ex-ante ideal level of physical activity exceeds the actual physical activity they carry out). The dual-self model predicts that the level of time inconsistent preferences is decreasing in sophistication, while the quasi-hyperbolic model suggests that this level is independent of sophistication. We carry out these tests in a large multi-wave general population survey, where we measure the time inconsistency, sophistication and stated demand for commitment in physical activity of respondents. We allocate a subset of this population to a treatment to increase their sophistication, and measure the treatment effect on time inconsistency, sophistication and demand for commitment."
