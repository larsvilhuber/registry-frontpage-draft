abstract: "We aim to understand how to communicate carbon tax and redistribution policies in order to improve citizens' support for carbon taxes. Our experiment design consists of two parts: (i) the explanation of carbon taxes (a basic explanation, the externality nature of carbon emission, the efficiency, and re-distribution), and (ii) information on the gains and losses of a household under a certain redistribution scheme depending on the per capita income and carbon footprint. A random set of information on the explanation of carbon taxes and the information on the gains and losses would be delivered to the respondents, before they decide whether they accept such a policy. The answers are incentivized to reduce measurement errors. "
