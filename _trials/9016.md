abstract: "The starting point for the current research project is to understand the why there is a gender gap at the top of the performance distribution for a high-stakes college entrance exam in Colombia.  It has been previously documented that women’s academic performance declines when stakes are high (Cai et al., 2019) and that this has consequences for their admission to their preferred academic program (Jurajda & Münich, 2011). Some research has looked at gender differences in willingness to take risk and self-confidence to explain the gender gap (Riener & Wagner, 2018), and it has been documented in a number of studies that women are less willing to guess in exams and therefore leave more questions unanswered, resulting in lower test scores (Baldiga, 2014; Coffman & Klinowski, 2020). In this paper, we investigate whether differences in performance among these top performing females and men result from gender differences in their test-taking strategies. The current pre-analysis plan details the treatments proposed for a pilot which will be run before scaling up the intervention in spring 2022. "
