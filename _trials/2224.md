abstract: "Initially, it was believed that microcredit would be an effective tool for encouraging growth of microenterprises. Several recent studies, however, suggest that microloans have not had dramatic benefits for most entrepreneurs and that microcredit-funded businesses rarely grow beyond a subsistence level of entrepreneurship. Other recent evidence shows that small changes to contract structure can have a long-term effect on investment and profits. In this project, I conduct investment games in a lab-in-field setting to test the effect of an 'equity-based' contract structure on the investment decisions of microenterprise owners.
