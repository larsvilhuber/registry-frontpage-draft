abstract: "Conceived by researchers in cognitive psychology and psycholinguistics and designed by LearnEnjoy, a French start-up specialised in the development of educational digital applications for children with specific needs, the School application aims to facilitate the integration of newly arrived allophone pupils by (i) providing them with personalised pedagogical content allowing them to progress at their own pace, (ii) training their teachers in the use of the application in the classroom and (iii) training their parents in the use of the application to increase their involvement in their childrenâ€™s education. The full-scale project plans to randomize the deployment of the application and these trainings over the period 2023-2025. The impact will be assessed on (i) child development, learning and integration, (ii) parental involvement in education and social inclusion, as well as (iii) teaching practices in a multicultural context. The pilot study is first deployed during the period 2023-2024 in 4 French academic regions."
