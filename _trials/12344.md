abstract: "We experimentally study the effects of advice on decision-making in a dictator game. In the experiment, participants receive no advice, selfish advice, or fair advice before making decisions. Advisors do not benefit from the actions of the decision-makers. We hypothesize that participants who receive fair (selfish) advice are more likely to choose the fair (selfish) option, compared to those who receive no advice. However, the impact of selfish advice is stronger than that of fair advice. The experimental design enables us to investigate the impact of both fair and selfish advice in moral dilemmas."
