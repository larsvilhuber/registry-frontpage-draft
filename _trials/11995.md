abstract: "This lean impact evaluation in Burundi evaluates a new decentralized school feeding procurement model based on Commodity Voucher (CV) compared to the preexisting centralized procurement model being piloted by the World Food Programme (WFP). The preexisting model involves WFP procuring food internationally and delivering it to schools through implementing partners, while the new model involves a more decentralized approach with WFP transferring funds to the Direction Provinciale de l'Education (DPE), which purchases from local cooperatives that deliver food directly to schools. The study uses a randomized controlled trial design to assess the impact of the new procurement method on service delivery and will provide evidence of its efficiency and reliability to inform the scaling up of the home-grown school feeding procurement model. The study uses administrative data, monthly head teacher surveys, and a round of farmer and cooperative surveys to measure descriptive impacts. "
