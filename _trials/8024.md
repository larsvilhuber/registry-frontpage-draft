abstract: "This experiment aims to find effects of taste-based discrimination within German politicians in the responsiveness towards voters with immigrant background and without immigrant background as well towards voters of different political attitudes.
Therefore, we designed an experiment with two binary dimensions on side of the inquirers who ask candidates of districts for the German Bundestag about their opinion on dual citizenship. We take the candidates of the 6 parties currently represented in the German Bundestag into account. Candidates of districts constitute half of the parliament. Within each district, the candidate with the most votes is elected. The first of the two dimensions of the inquirers is a potential immigrant background. The inquirer signals, from a German point of view, an immigrant background or not. The second dimension is the opinion on dual citizenship, in an affirmative or rejecting sense. Each candidate is contacted via email by one of the four profiles which consist of all convex combinations of the two dimensions. We will then observe whether a candidate responds to the request and if, how much time was required and what opinion on dual citizenship is conveyed.
