abstract: "We implement a survey experiment in the 2022 wave of the OeNB Euro Survey. The OeNB Euro Survey is a repeated cross-sectional survey conducted annually in ten different countries. The aim of the survey experiment is threefold. First, we test the feasibility of different randomization approaches across countries and whether falsification or errors in implementation regarding randomization might be a concern. Second, we examine data falsification in terms of individual responses. If there is evidence of data falsification, these effects how interviewers or survey institutes behave, would influence and/or blur treatment effects in respondents’ behavior. Third, we test a standard assumption in survey research regarding scale transformation. It is common in surveys when asking respondents to report wages to give them the choice which reporting unit to use, i.e. wage per hour, month or year. If these questions are used in research projects, numbers are then often set to the same scale. In our treatment, we vary on which scale respondents are supposed to report a specific wage. This experiment allows us to analyze if the assumption of, e.g., linear transformation based on full-time working hours, is valid."
