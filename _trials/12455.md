abstract: "This study is a long-term follow-up (15 years after program start, when program participants will be aged 30-32) of a large-scale clustered RCT that tested three strategies to reduce child marriage and increase girls' human capital in rural Bangladesh: (i) a six-month adolescent empowerment program (Kishoree Kontha), (ii) a conditional in-kind incentive to delay marriage, or (iii) empowerment + conditional incentive. The aim of this follow-up is to estimate program impacts on program participants and intergenerational impacts on their children."
