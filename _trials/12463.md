abstract: "We run a randomized control trial to study the targeting of incentive payments for completion of digital skills programs for teenage girls in Lahore. We fix the total household incentive for completion of the program to 3,000 PKR. We cross randomize incentive contracts that split the amount of stipend handed to parents and daughters, along with full information on the total household stipend to parents. This results in 6 randomization groups. We investigate differences in parental consent, girls drop out, and total household completion by group.  "
