abstract: "We will evaluate an intervention providing teacher training and community literacy programming to 160 schools in Nampula province in Mozambique, partnering with World Vision (WV) Mozambique and funded by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). WV is rolling out an early grade literacy program, Unlock Literacy (UL), that comprises two components. First, WV trains teachers in sound pedagogical practices that facilitate early grade reading and will provide coaches to follow up with teachers. Second, community interventions are conducted to encourage parents to help their children read. As part of the community interventions, “reading camps” are established. The reading camps are designed to be interactive and fun learning experiences for children to learn and practice reading outside of school and are run by older children in the community. Schools will be randomly assigned to three groups: a control arm, an arm receiving teacher training only, and an arm receiving teacher training and community literacy programming; all schools in the evaluation also receive school meals.  The outcomes of interest in the evaluation include grade three literacy, student attendance and grade attainment, teacher attendance, and teaching practices. We hypothesize that teacher training will improve reading outcomes and may improve attendance, attainment, and teacher practices. We further hypothesize that the addition of the enhanced reading camps will further improve reading, attendance, and attainment."
