abstract: "We are currently running a field experiment in Addis Ababa, in which we place treated respondents in a four-week ‘management internship’, to work alongside middle and senior managers of established Ethiopian firms. This Pre-Analysis Plan outlines our primary hypotheses and accompanying identification strategy. At the time of writing, we are finalising 12-month follow-up interviews, and cleaning the data."
