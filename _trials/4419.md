abstract: "Civil conflicts kill and injure millions of people, and leave many more destitute. They expose individuals to gruesome violence either as witnesses, victims or perpetrators. Armed conflict environments create an acceptable climate for violence, reduce individualsâ€™ inhibitions against violent acts, and lead to the normalization of violence in everyday life. It is very likely that such experiences affect people psychologically, and that these effects manifest themselves in different ways in interpersonal relations, and in economic and political life even long after the conflict is over. Nevertheless, there exist few studies analyzing individual level data on actual exposure to political violence in a civil conflict context to decipher the effects on behavior.

This projects aims to study the relationship between the exposure to civil conflict violence and individual cooperation. Our study will use a novel way of identifying exogenous variation of exposure to violence. Our project will conduct a large scale survey and collect several measures of violence (including binary and continuous measures) in addition to many other important information on individuals. (Due to the sensitive nature of our project, until the project is completed, we will not disclose further information regarding our measures of violence). Our survey will incorporate an incentivized field experiment in which individuals will make a donation towards a charitable cause out of an endowment that is given to them. They will be told that one other randomly selected individual that is participating in the survey and themselves will jointly give to an anonymous poor family. They will not be told the identity or the donation of the other person. They will only be told that the poor family will receive the total donations made by themselves and this other randomly selected individual. While half of individuals in our sample will decide how much to give to a poor family that lives in a non-conflict region, the other half will decide how much to give to a poor family that lives in a conflict region. After individuals complete their donation decisions, they will also be asked about their beliefs (as a surprise question) regarding how much the other person donates. Similar to their donation decisions, belief elicitation is also incentivized.
