abstract: "We explore one potential explanation for the low rate of female labor force participation in India: women’s willingness and/or ability to leave home to access economic opportunities. We provide women with an income-generating opportunity, and randomize the  location of work: either from their homes or from a workshop in their village center.  We then examine two potential mechanisms driving the differences in labor supply: complementarity of in-home activities with economic production, and negative social perceptions around women’s work.
