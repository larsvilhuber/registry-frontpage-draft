abstract: "Schools at all levels have been closed across much of the world due to Covid-19. This situation poses a significant threat to student learning, attachment to schools, and their mental health. To minimize the loss of school days, many governments are implementing distance learning programs through radio or TV in the developing countries. The Government of Bangladesh (GoB) has started broadcasting pre-recorded classes through a designated TV channel (Sangsad TV) from 29 March 2020 for secondary students (grades 6-10) . The program titled ‘My school at home’ will run each day from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm broadcasting classes on different subjects for each grade.

While it is possible for TV/radio-based distance learning to be effective, many of the challenges of in-person education (such as student engagement and reaching students at their level) are exacerbated with distance learning.  We therefore propose to test an intervention with SMS and phone call-based reminder of TV broadcast, and another intervention with incentives based on weekly quizzes along with SMS and phone call-based reminder, to improve student’s engagement and learning from the TV-based distance learning in Bangladesh. The impact evaluation will focus on assessing whether in the treatment groups students’ engagement with the TV-based learning and performance are on average better than the students in the control group using baseline and endline data.
