abstract: "This study has three primary goals. First, we plan to estimate how willingness to reduce electricity use during "peak periods" varies based on weather conditions (i.e. heat), individual characteristics (i.e. baseline income) and household characteristics (i.e. having solar or a PEV). 
Second, we plan to examine how the interaction between financial and non-financial framing affect consumers willingness to reduce electricity during peak periods. This part of the project has two parts. First, we randomly assign individuals to receive one of two frames when being introduced to the project: a financial frame (emphasizing financial savings from conservation)  and an environmental frame. Individuals in the environmental frame are then further randomized to receive one of two framings when receiving demand events: a moral tax frame that emphasizes the negative consequences of not participating and a moral subsidy frame that emphasizes the benefits of participating. All individuals are then further randomized into either receiving a financial reward for participating in the demand event or no reward. Using the interactions between these treatment cohorts, we will test: a) how introductory framing affects willingness to reduce energy , b) whether framing the consequences of (not) participating in a positive or negative light affects willingness to reduce energy and c) whether any effects of the environmental framing are "crowded in" or "crowded out" from receiving a financial reward. 
Finally, we will examine how various features of demand events affects consumer's willingness to reduce energy. Specifically, we examine: a) whether consumers respond differently to a constant vs event-varying price and whether this response depends upon if the price increased or decreased relative to the previous event and b) if consumers willingness to reduce is increased or decreased by concentrating events (i.e. 3 events/week vs 1 event/week) and if a greater concentration of events leads to longer-term energy conservation habit formation.  Our sample will consist of more than 12,000 customers from Chai Energy, an app-based energy demand system. We will attempt to recruit customers from diverse socio-economic backgrounds as well as from a wide geographic range (within California) in order to test heterogeneity in response. "
