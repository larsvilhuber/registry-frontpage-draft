abstract: "This project studies the effect of complexity on the selection of models in a market environment. We simulate a market involving three types of agents – buyers, non-expert sellers, and expert sellers who have access to better data statistics – interacting over multiple rounds. In this "market for models", all agents have access to the same data but must choose among different models that explain these data. Buyers are incentivized to select the most accurate model, while sellers also have an incentive to match the preferences of the buyer. Our study will first assess how increased complexity affects the dynamics of model selection from both the sellers' and the buyers' perspectives. Subsequently, we will explore market design interventions that could alter these dynamics. This includes education of buyers by informing them about the accuracy of the chosen statement. Additionally, we will introduce a reputation system allowing buyers to evaluate sellers based on their past offers.  "
