abstract: "This study consists of a randomized evaluation of several programs to encourage academic achievement among upper-primary school students (grades 4-8) in rural Malawi. In each of the two years of the study different programs are being evaluated. In Year 1, two scholarship programs are compared with a control group. The first is a “relative” merit-based scholarship program which provides rewards to students based on performance relative to a comparison group with similar baseline test scores. The second is a "standard" merit-based scholarship program in which students with the top overall test scores receive a scholarship. In addition to the scholarship programs, information on a student's rank is randomly provided to a randomly selected half of the students to examine the impact of providing this additional information. The researchers will estimate the impacts of each type of scholarship program on student test scores as well as impacts of and interactions with the information treatment. In the second year, the relative merit-based scholarship program is being evaluated alongside a program that provides after-school tutoring services to randomly-selected students. The researchers will estimate the impacts of each program on student test scores and complementarities between the two programs. The researchers will also examine how pre-existing social networks mediate the effectiveness of the interventions.  "
