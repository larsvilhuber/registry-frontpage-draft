abstract: "Internet banking adoption is low among “Boomers” in Germany and other developed countries although they hold considerable wealth. We develop education concepts to foster internet banking adoption and evaluate them in a field experiment with elderly clients of a large German savings bank. Specifically, we use traditional knowledge-based approaches as well as approaches that focus on social connection and teach non-technical adoption skills – since fear of failure and technophobia are key obstacles to internet banking adoption. We assess the effectiveness of these approaches based on individual log-in and transaction data and use two surveys (pre-survey and post-survey) to identify key mechanisms."
