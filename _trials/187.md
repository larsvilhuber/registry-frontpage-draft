abstract: "Objectives: The present study aimed to investigate the effects of adjuvant zinc therapy on recovery from pneumonia in hospitalized children.
Methods: In a double-blind randomized controlled trial at Ayatollah Golpaygani Hospital in Qom, 120 children aged 3-60 months with pneumonia randomly received zinc (5 ml BID) or placebo along with the common antibiotic treatments until discharge. It was assumed that this element (zinc) was effective in resolving clinical symptoms and duration of hospitalization.
Results: Compared to the placebo group, the group receiving zinc showed a statistically significant decrease in duration of clinical symptoms (p = 0.044) and hospitalization (p = 0.004). The difference between frequency distributions of all clinical symptoms at admittance and the variables affecting the disease were not statistically significant (p > 0.05).
Conclusions: Supplemental administration of zinc can expedite the healing process and results in faster resolution of clinical symptoms in children with pneumonia. In general, zinc administration, along with common antibiotic treatments is recommended in this group of children. It can also reduce the drug resistance caused by multiple antibiotic therapies.
