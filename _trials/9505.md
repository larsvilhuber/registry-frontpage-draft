abstract: "The study aims to understand how silence, interacting with social norms around holding specific views, shape political discourse. Specifically, we hypothesize that individuals who hold socially acceptable views are more likely to vocalize their views while those who hold socially sanctioned views are more likely to stay silent. If people are not sufficiently sophisticated about selection into expression or silence, this will lead to misperceptions about the distribution of political views, which in turn affects political choices of political expression and action. Taken together, this can lead to self-reinforcing loops of political expression and action in equilibrium. We propose a field experiment on college campuses to test whether drawing attention to the silent majority shift perceived social norms and political discourse in equilibrium. "
