abstract: "This project aims at evaluating an intervention to decrease the prevalence of  female genital cutting  (FGC) in Sierra Leone.  In Sierra Leone, FGC is practiced as part of the initiation ritual for girls to join secret societies, sometimes referred to as ‘Bondo’.  This study is a 3-arm randomized control trial, with two intervention groups and one control group.  Data is collected at baseline, 6 months after the intervention, and 18 months after the intervention.  This is done through the administration of questionnaires to mothers and non-invasive gynecological health checks with girls aged 7-15.  There are two interventions being carried out at the village level.  The first intervention is the presentation of visual information regarding the consequences of FGM for women.  This information is presented through posters at community meetings, where the visual information is explained and discussion around the topics is facilitated.  The second intervention works with the community to support Bondo without Cutting. That is, an intervention which supports the community in practicing initiation into the Bondo secret societies, but promotes shifting cutting to a different, non-harmful practice.  The study will look at the prevalence of FGC amongst the study communities, as well as indicators such as shifts in perception or an increase in the age of those undergoing FGM.
