abstract: "This study had two main goals. The first was to investigate the impact of formal property rights on a wide range of outcomes, including investment incentives, expropriation risk, credit access and property market outcomes. In addition to this, the study was designed specifically to increase the proportion of formal property owners who were female, and thus aimed to understand whether households were less likely to obtain a formal title when a woman would be registered as a co-owner. To these ends, the trial was run in two adjacent unplanned settlements in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Blocks of informally-held land parcels were randomly-selected: treatment parcels received cadastral surveying and subsidized access to formal titles (CROs) as well as assistance with the relevant paperwork, where control parcels had to access CROs at their full price and obtain cadastral surveying on their own. In addition to this block level randomization, parcels within treatment blocks received vouchers, allocated in a public lottery, which reduced their subsidized price by a further 20-80%. A random subset of these vouchers had a condition: that at least one woman was included as a co-owner of the property upon registration. This design allowed the research team to identify the demand curve for CROs while also understanding if gender conditionality depressed demand.
