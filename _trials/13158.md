abstract: "We study the ability of AI to improve the assessment of trustworthiness using a natural field experiment. We collaborate with a nationally leading debt collection agency in the Philippines for this field experiment. After being contacted by collection agents, some debtors may offer their verbal promises to start repaying over the phone. Agents have to assess the trustworthiness of the promise and---if the promise is at risk of being broken---renegotiate the settlement. We test the effect of an AI-powered prediction model on the performance of debt collectors."
