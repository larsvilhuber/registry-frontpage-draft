abstract: "We conduct an RCT in Ghana on a sample of 2000 female entrepreneurs of SMEs to investigate the effects of an online matching service combined with access to legal information and advisory services on collaborations, firm innovation and performance. The study sample will consist of female entrepreneurs who have applied to the COVID-19 Stimulus Fund offered by our our NGO partners, Women's Empowerment & Investment Group (WEIG), Annan Capital Partners (ACP), and GUBA Foundation, for business grants of $2,000-$5,000 between June 1st and August 31st 2020. The support programs will begin in February. Data will be collected by phone surveys in November 2020, June 2021 and in December 2021."
