abstract: "What are the impacts of transportation costs on agricultural value chains? We introduce experimental variation in transportation costs by randomizing the provision of transportation services for agricultural produce from truckers to randomly selected farmers and local aggregators. We estimate impacts on prices, transportation costs, and agricultural production and marketing. In addition, we use a BDM mechanism to elicit truckers' costs of providing transportation services; we combine this with transaction-level data to shed light on the determinants of intermediation in agricultural value chains including transportation costs."
