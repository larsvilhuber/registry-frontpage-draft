abstract: "Existing research on remote working has yielded mixed results on employee's performance and organizational behavior. They have largely sampled from a population that has started their job working in the office prior to working remotely. As a result, we know very little about the effects of remote working on new hires and the newcomer socialization process. This question is significant as millions of new hires have been socialized exclusively remotely, especially since the Covid-19 pandemic. This RCT studies the effects of remote working vs. office working on new hires."
