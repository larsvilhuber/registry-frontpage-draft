abstract: "Public service organizations often evaluate their performance using surveys of user satisfaction with the offered services. The proposed study examines how the order of questions in a user satisfaction survey affects reported satisfaction with specific aspects of service as well as overall satisfaction. Research reveals mixed findings on the effects of presenting questions about satisfaction with specific aspects of government performance before or after questions about overall satisfaction. Using a split-ballot survey experiment, we aim to provide new evidence that may help resolve the issue. We embed the experiment in a national survey by a government agency. The agency is responsible for managing and granting government funding for social welfare projects. Private and public organizations of all kinds and type may (and do) apply. The survey captures grant recipients’ satisfaction with the agency services relating to the processes of applying for, receiving, and administering the grant. We test the effects of two treatments on the survey respondents’ reported service satisfaction: (1) survey question on overall satisfaction presented before questions on satisfaction with specific aspects of service and (2) question on overall satisfaction presented after questions on satisfaction with specific aspects of service."
