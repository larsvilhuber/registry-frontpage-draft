abstract: "In 2014, the USPTO established the Pro Se Pilot Examination Unit (PSPEU) to help inventors without legal representation (pro se inventors) as they went through the patent examination process by providing enhanced guidance and information. After stratifying by technology, pro se patent applications were randomly assigned to the treatment group, the PSPEU, or the control group, the regular examination process."
