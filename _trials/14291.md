abstract: "The rising cost of commercial feed for poultry and fish in Bangladesh has resulted in an exploration of Black Soldier Fly (BSF) larvae as an environment-friendly alternative to the protein and fat contents in traditional feed sources. BSF larvae consume organic waste, reducing pollution and preventing methane gas emissions. The intervention for this research involved providing farmers training on BSF Larvae cultivation through online YouTube training materials, with some farmers being provided with BSF eggs or larvae as inputs to encourage uptake. The study randomly selected 120 village catchment areas, designating 40 villages as Treatment 1, 40 villages as Treatment 2, and the remaining 40 as Control Villages â€“ consisting of 1440 farmers in total as the study population. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of using digitally mediated training for climate-friendly agricultural technology, the uptake of BSF larvae cultivation as an alternative feed source for poultry or aquaculture, and the monetary advantages or disadvantages of BSF larvae cultivation. The use of digital mediums for training delivery could have broader implications for disseminating agricultural training efficiently over large populations and distances."
