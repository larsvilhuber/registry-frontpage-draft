abstract: "As in-person assessments are no longer feasible because of pandemic-related lockdowns, measures of cognitive outcomes have been collected through distance assessment tests in order to monitor children's learning and measure potential impacts. A very important aspect of using distant tools with preschoolers is that parents play a key role in supporting the implementation of the assessments at home. At the same time, by being present during the phone call,  parents have access to information about age-specific milestones for their children as well as the opportunity to observe their children's performance during the test. In this study we examine whether parental perceptions, expectations and knowledge about early childhood development are influenced by the administration of this procedure at home. The results will shed light on some of the impacts of performing distance assessments which are likely to become a common practice in the context of remote learning and school lockdowns."
