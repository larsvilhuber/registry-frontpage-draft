abstract: "In 2019, Nigeria approved the commercial release of a transgenic pod-borer insect-resistant (PBR) cowpea variety. The new variety is expected to generate yield gains of at least 20 percent and can reduce the costs of and exposure to pesticide applications, with particular benefit to female-headed households that represent a relatively large share of households engaged in cowpea production. However, the dissemination of the PBR variety is still in its early stages, such that awareness and adoption are still limited. The primary objective of the study is to estimate the impact of PBR cowpea on key productivity, income, environmental, and social outcomes at the household and farm levels in Nigeriaâ€™s main cowpea-producing regions. The study will use a cluster randomized controlled trial (c-RCT) with an encouragement design highlighted by two treatment arms. The evaluation will randomly select communities who receive PBR cowpea seed packages. There will be two treatment groups: Treatment 1 (T1) will receive PBR cowpea plus fertilizer and pesticide for 2 kg of PBR cowpea package; and treatment 2 (T2) will receive only 2 kg of PBR cowpea package. The control group (C) will receive conventional cowpea seed packages. The study will collect and analyze data from baseline, midline, and endline surveys of treatment and control farmers to estimate the causal impacts of the intervention on PBR cowpea adoption, yields, returns, pesticide use, refugia use, and other outcomes of interest. Additional analysis on the underlying mechanisms will be conducted with the help of qualitative data obtained from key informant interviews and focus group discussions with farmers, extension agents, market actors, and other stakeholders in the cowpea value chain. Findings will be used to inform an analysis of the cowpea value chain in Nigeria and the potential opportunities and constraints that may influence PBR cowpea adoption, production, and market sales.
