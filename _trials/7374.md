abstract: "We study the impact of an information treatment for unemployed job seekers. The treatment consists of a personalized email providing suggestions about suitable alternative occupations, including details on the labor market prospects of these occupations. An extended version of the treatment also adds a motivational video aiming to reduce psychological hurdles of switching to a different occupation. The email will be sent to jobseekers active in occupations with relatively bad labor market prospects and will be accompanied by a pre- and posttreatment survey on labor market beliefs and expectations. Administrative data on outflow to work will be used for an evaluation of long-term impacts."
