abstract: "The focus of this experiment will be the effect that the structure of the insurance market has on the outcomes of ransomware attacks. In a simple model, we can show that ransomware insurance affects the distribution of attackers' ransom requests and the likelihood that the data is returned. In the experiment, we will empirically evaluate the effects of two types of insurance: "naive" (insurance that is predicted to lead to lower overall efficiency) and "sophisticated" (insurance that is predicted to lead to higher overall efficiency).
