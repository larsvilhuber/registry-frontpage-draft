abstract: "This project studies the labor market matching process between young workers and firms in Uganda. We focus on three core aspects of this process. First, we study the relative importance of cognitive and non-cognitive skills in determining the labor market outcomes of young workers; second, we examine whether asymmetric information on the skills of youth that first enter the labor market is a significant source of inefficiency in terms of reduced employment opportunities and mismatch; third, we study whether an intervention improving the signal to potential employers on the skills of job market entrants reduces the asymmetric information problem and limits the related inefficiencies. We carry out this analysis through a randomized control trial in the Ugandan labor market. Our intervention exogenously improves the signals employers receive about a given young workerâ€™s non-cognitive skills, and hence is intended to reduce information asymmetries during the recruitment process. We then trace the impacts this has on worker and firm outcomes.
