abstract: "The dramatic improvements in enrollment rates that have been achieved in most developing countries over the past decade have not been matched by comparable improvements in learning outcomes. In other words, more time in school has not translated to more learning. India is a case in point: according to the Annual Status of Education Report  more than 96% of all children in the age group of 6-14 years are enrolled in school, but only half of children in Grade 5 can read a Grade 2 level text or solve simple two-digit subtraction problems. Clearly, increasing the quantity of schooling is not enough and there is an urgent need to better understand how to improve the quality of schooling (learning outcomes), especially in the poorest areas of the world. 

This research project will focus on two major constraints contributing to poor learning performance. First, teachers in most developing countries are expected to teach a demanding curriculum, regardless of the learning levels of the children. Hence, if a child is lost in early grades, it becomes very hard for him or her to catch up, as teachers put more weight on covering the grade-level curriculum than on making sure everybody achieves strong basic skills . Second, children often receive little support for their learning outside school, from family and community. This makes it very hard to practice and improve on whatever they have learned in class. 

By partnering with the largest NGO working in the Indian education sector, we plan to evaluate the effectiveness of two programs that specifically addresses these two constraints, over a period of 18 months. These programs will be evaluated at large-scale using a randomized controlled trial methodology and exploiting the expansion of Pratham’s activities within the state of Assam, in India. The research is expected to contribute to new and better understanding on which programs and policies work and which do not, and how effective policies can be used to improve children’s learning levels in the poorest part of the world.

2020 update:
The data collection, covering 5,300 children and 4,200 caretakers, was completed in January 2020, right before the COVID-19 outbreak. We then plan to conduct a new follow-up survey towards the end of 2020 to study three novel questions. First, we want to study how children’s learning outcomes and psychological wellbeing have been affected by the pandemic. Second, we want to understand whether the study interventions mitigated some of the negative consequences. Third, we want to understand how families and communities have coped with respect to their children’s education when schools were closed.

Our follow-up study has two primary components: the first is a phone-survey conducted with the caregivers of the children, and the second is an in-person survey and assessment of children. Since we plan to track the same sample - we will first survey Principals/Head teachers of the study schools to update the contact details of the caregivers and to determine the status of school re-opening, teaching-learning activities conducted during the lockdown period, and support provided/received since the COVID-19 outbreak. After collecting/updating all contact details, we will then administer the phone-survey with caregivers, to collect data on educational/learning support received by the household and child during the lockdown, caregiver support to the child, parental perceptions on schools reopening, aspirations for their children, etc. Finally, we will administer the survey and assessment in-person to children when it is possible, since the learning test and the psychological wellbeing module cannot be reliably conducted over the phone.
