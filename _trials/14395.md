abstract: "The proposed project is organized around a well-designed and rigorous RCT aimed at identifying the role of knowledge dissemination, skills training and regular practice, achieved by goal setting and regularly monitoring whether goals set have been realized. The idea is not only to replace bad habits with good ones but also to maintain them by slow habit formation. This research endeavor encapsulates about 2,000 mother-child dyads hailing from 100 distinct slum clusters situated in the district of Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, India. We will focus on mothers aged 18-45 years with a child below five years i.e. the focus will be on starting early or early childhood development (ECD). "
