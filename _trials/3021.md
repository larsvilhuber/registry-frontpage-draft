abstract: "The existence of the gender gap in employment is well established in the economic literature. But why do women work less than men? In this project, we investigate whether gender norms can have an impact on intended labour market participation and preferences for job attributes of adolescents in Germany. We implement a survey experiment among a representative sample of adolescents aged between 14 and 17 years. The treatment group is informed about the social norm according to which mothers should reduce their labour market participation when their children are very young. By comparing responses between the uninformed control group and the treatment group, we evaluate (i) whether information about social norms affects intended labour market participation and preferences for job attributes per se and (ii) whether information about social norms affects the gender gap in intended labour market participation and job attribute preferences.
