abstract: "We propose to combine the tools of psychology and economics to study the broader question of how gun access affects decisions with real financial consequences for participants in a controlled laboratory setting. We first replicate an experiment from psychology in which realistic gun access is randomized and a perception task is performed. We then extend this experiment by asking subjects to perform a standard lottery choice task from the experimental economics literature and test for an impact of gun access on financial risk-taking."
