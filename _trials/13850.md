abstract: "Internal whistleblowing is often considered a trade-off between establishing fairness by stopping wrongdoing and reporting a colleague to whom one feels loyalty. Therefore, the whistleblowing decision may be influenced by multiple normative expectations that cannot be met simultaneously because a potential whistleblower might perceive that others find both behavioural options, whistleblowing and remaining silent, similarly (in-)appropriate. Hence, in our study, we measure normative expectations regarding both behavioural options (whistleblowing and remaining silent) and investigate how they (jointly) affect the whistleblowing decision. Based thereon, we design social information interventions to examine if/how communicating normative expectations about the appropriateness of both behaviours (whistleblowing and remaining silent) compared to communicating just one increases whistleblowing behaviour. We investigate this by means of an incentivized experiment (basic experiment and three treatments) that we conduct on the platform Prolific with real employees. "
