abstract: "This project aims to quantify the causal effects of being exposed to peers with better cognitive and social skills. To identify these effects, I conduct an RCT in Selective Enrollment High Schools in Peru. Students were classified into four types based on admission test scores and centrality measures of social networks: (i) high-cognitive high-social, (ii) high-cognitive low-social, (iii) low-cognitive high-social, (iv) low-cognitive low-social. Conditional on the studentâ€™s type, they were randomly assigned to groups with different types of peers. These groups were used for the assignment to dormitories (in 3rd, 4th and 5th grade) and classrooms (in 3rd grade). I can use this variation to identify causal peer effects on social networks, standardized test scores, and non-cognitive skills. An important component of the latter are social skills, which will be measured by a group of psychologists through interviews and group activities.  The final purpose of the project is to develop a theoretical model that uses this variation and results to identify the optimal group composition given an objective function of a policy-maker. "
