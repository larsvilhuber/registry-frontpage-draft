abstract: "There is a growing appreciation for the use of technology in UK SMEs to remain competitive. This is evident from the recent CBI report “From Ostrich to Magpie” that claims improving UK companies’ adoption of existing technologies offers a unique opportunity to raise SMEs business productivity. The report highlights improving management best practice, innovation and diffusion, acknowledging the need for businesses to learn and apply new knowledge.  

Given that 75% of SMEs use an external accountant (ICAEW, 2014), a programme which focuses on 'Making Accountants Digital Enablers' (MADE) could reach a high proportion of SMEs through existing channels. The accreditation bodies, as well as large firms, such as Sage (UK) Ltd are a route to engage, recruit, train and interact with a large proportion of accountants.  

This is a non-business led trial designed by academics at Newcastle Business School, Northumbria University, in collaboration with Sage (UK) Ltd. Northumbria has developed the project infrastructure, will manage and drive the research and co-ordinate the dissemination of findings.
