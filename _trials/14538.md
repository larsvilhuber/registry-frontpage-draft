abstract: "To supplement data from an existing vignette (survey) experiment that studied the factors that impact the willingness to follow advice in India, we aim to conduct a follow up survey. 

The survey will measure the characteristics of the past and current village chiefs, attitudes towards misinformation, measures of community social capital and other factors that may be related to advice following. The respondents will be individuals who participated in the initial survey experiment.

This registration supplements the existing proposal submitted under the following ID: AEARCTR-0008659"
