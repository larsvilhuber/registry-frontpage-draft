abstract: "Personal Initiative (PI) trainings and other psychology-based entrepreneurship trainings are promising approaches to teaching entrepreneurial skills and improving beneficiaries’ outcomes (McKenzie et al., 2020). PI trainings aim to equip entrepreneurs with the skills needed to become more self-starting, proactive, and persistent and become more future-orientated in their new businesses and in other activities they may be engaged in. Despite the promising results of this type of training, the evidence of its effectiveness on adolescents and young girls is very limited. However, given that skills are more malleable in this period, this type of training has the potential to be more impactful among adolescents. Additionally, as adolescent girls and young women face social and gender norms restricting their agency and access to resources, the impact of interventions such as psychology based training on girls’ empowerment outcomes in this context is an empirical question that this study aims also to address.

In the context of Niger, a PI training will be designed and piloted. The intervention will be targeted at adolescent girls and young women 15-27 years old, out-of-school, married and unmarried. Using a randomized controlled trial, with randomization at the village level, this study will assess the impacts of an adapted Personal Initiative training on girls’ economic empowerment outcomes, agency, and aspirations. The study will include two rounds of data collection (three if budget allows) and cover a sample of approximately 4,000 adolescent girls and their households in around 100 villages.
