abstract: "Throughout the developing world, people lack access to timely and accurate information in a language they understand. Lack of access to reliable information can result in a waste of resources as well as a range of suboptimal health decisions, including decisions to not seek prenatal care or to use ineffective family planning methods. 

To address these knowledge barriers, new call-in services have been developed in LMICS in recent years. These services are free and easily accessible from any phone, and offer validated and generally government approved information to the general population in LMICs. One of the main organizations offering such services is Viamo, a global social enterprise aiming to improve the lives of the poor through mobile services.

The goal of this project is to rigorously assess the impact of the Viamo’s 3-2-1 Service on health knowledge, health behavior and selected health outcomes in Uganda. A total of 6000 women of reproductive age will be enrolled in a randomized controlled trial. Half of these women will be randomly selected for a personal introduction to Viamo’s 3-2-1 service and encouraged to use this service for a year. After one year, health knowledge, health behavior and health outcomes will be compared across treatment and control groups. The primary study outcome will be reproductive health knowledge. Secondary outcomes include use of modern contraception, nutritional status and self-reported health.
