abstract: "We conduct a field experiment in which employers publicize female-friendly job characteristics---the characteristics that may matter particularly to women---in their job ads. Because of female-specific barriers such as social norms and risks of harassment, there may exist certain job characteristics that concern particularly women. For example, flexible work time may be as important as salaries for women, while it may not be so for men. These characteristics, however, may be hard to observe, and as a result, women may not apply for jobs. This information friction on female-friendly job characteristics is the focus of our research. We will examine whether publicizing female friendliness leads women to apply for and get well-matched jobs and whether it also helps employers hire well-matched workers.
	Our interventions are twofold: the first intervention displays female-friendly characteristics in the job ads of randomly selected employers; the second intervention adds female-friendliness information to randomly selected job alerts that are sent to jobseekers individually. This combination of interventions allows us to examine the impacts on both jobseekers and employers. The experiment is conducted in the entirety of an online job portal in Pakistan.
