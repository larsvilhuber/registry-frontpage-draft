abstract: "A randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to investigate the effects of emotional and cognitive priming on prosocial behavior in Italian adults. A total of 1,500 Italian adults will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: 500 subjects to the emotional priming (through a photo), 500 subjects to the cognitive priming (through a diagram), 500 subjects to the control group. Participants in the emotional priming group will be shown a well-identifiable image of the COVID period. Participants in the cognitive priming group will be shown a picture of a diagram showing COVID related data. Participants in the control group will not be shown any picture. Participants will then play three experimental games: a Prisoner's Dilemma (PD), an Ultimatum Game as Proposer (UGP), and an Ultimatum Game as Responder (UGR). The results of this RCT are expected to show whether participants in the different priming groups will exhibit different choices than control group participants. The findings of this RCT may help expanding the understanding of the factors that influence prosocial behavior, especially in relation to the post-pandemic context."
