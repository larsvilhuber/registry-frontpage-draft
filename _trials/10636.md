abstract: "This project studies the effect of reducing sales uncertainty on farmers’ earnings and competition among purchasers. We partner with the largest purchaser of vanilla in Uganda in 10 districts. Our partner agribusiness (henceforth Partner) promotes organic farming and fair trade and represents the best buyer for vanilla farmers. Yet, the presence of several middle-men and the uncertainty around the international market usually press farmers into selling their products at a lower price. In particular, we collected anecdotal evidence that middle-men are systematically purchasing vanilla before the date set by the Ugandan government, sometimes spreading misleading information about the Partner not showing up in the upcoming vanilla season. 
We design text messages to reduce uncertainty faced by the vanilla farmers about (1) the Partner agribusiness's commitment to purchase from the farmer in the upcoming vanilla season and (2) the unit price ensured by Partner. In this experiment, we randomize farmers at sub-county level into three groups: farmers in the control group receive no text message; farmers in the treatment group 'market participation' receive a message that states commitment from our partner to purchase the farmers' product; farmers in the third group 'market participation + price' receive the same message together with a clear indication on the minimum price paid."
