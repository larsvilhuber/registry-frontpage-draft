abstract: "The purpose of this study is to explore how recipient framings and narratives surrounding foreign aid effect charitable donation. We examine this through the online platform Amazon Mechanical Turk. We randomly assign participants to receive one of three different framings of a cash transfer intervention taking place in Kenya. We then measure revealed social preferences by having participants allocate a lottery payout to themselves or the aid organization."
