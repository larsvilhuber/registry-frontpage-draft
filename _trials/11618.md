abstract: "With its central role in political stability and economic growth, youth employment is a persistent policy concern across developing countries. Instead of a skill gap alone preventing young jobseekers from finding employment, recent work demonstrates that a variety of information frictions also hinder the process. In this project, I explore the role of information frictions in job descriptions in preventing first-time jobseekers in India from finding quality jobs which are a good fit for them. I partner with a large Indian job board to examine the preferences of first-time jobseekers over amenities that are typically missing from job posts but that may be particularly important to jobseekers in developing countries, such as job training, transportation, and company verification.
