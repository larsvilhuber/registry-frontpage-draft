abstract: "We experimentally test our hypothesis, that participants bid more aggressively in multi-stage first-price auctions than in single-stage first-price auctions. This hypothesis is based on the assumption bidders are loss-averse narrow-bracketers and is driven by an increasing attachment effect. Standard theory predicts revenue equivalence. 
The multi-stage format consists of a semi-final and a final. In the semi-final the set of bidders is reduced to two based on highest bids, and in the final the good is allocated to the bidder with the highest final bid.
