abstract: "Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 2 billion people lived in countries affected by conflict, climate shocks, or disease. During these emergencies, schools often close, necessitating interventions that can complement or substitute traditional schooling. We present results from large-scale randomized trials across five countries to test the impact of delivering phone-based, remote instruction to children and their caregivers during COVID-19. "
