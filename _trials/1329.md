abstract: "This project tests whether the provision of smartphones to government inspectors increases the rate inspections of rural health facilities. At inception, the project was designed to test whether the personality traits of government personnel involved in implementing the project and the degree of local political competition and the relationship between relevant bureaucrats and politicians impacted the effectiveness of the smartphone intervention.
