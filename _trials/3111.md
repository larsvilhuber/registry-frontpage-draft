abstract: "Can information and community-based monitoring improve the delivery of public services? This study evaluates the Annotated Water Integrity Scan (AWIS), a participatory approach to assess governance risks in public service provision, identify priority risks and define action plans. The intervention is scalable, replicable and adaptable to a wide range of contexts: in this case, the provision of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) services in Bangladeshi schools."
