abstract: "This pilot study evaluates the impact of business skills training offered to owners and managers of SMEs in Metro Manila, Philippines.  Human capital constraints can hinder firm growth, and might be even more severe than financial constraints if having adequate managerial skills in place is a prerequisite for accessing other resources. However, the market for business skills training is prone to under-investment. This pilot looked at the various constraints hindering SME growth and at whether graduate business students providing consulting services to small business can be an effective conduit for skill transfer.  Registered businesses in Makati City meeting basic eligibility criteria were invited to receive free business consulting services provided by graduate students at the Asian Institute of Management (AIM).  Business owners expressing interest in the consulting program were randomly assigned to receive consulting or to serve as a comparison.  Businesses in the treatment group met regularly with their student-consultants over the course of two months and attended a business skills training workshop.  Consultants worked with their client firms on identifying the key constraints to firm growth as well as on strategies and recommendations for overcoming those constraints.  "
