abstract: "This study uses a randomized survey experiment to test to effects of using behavioural insights to frame safety processes and procedures among registered electrical contractors and registered gas installers in Ireland. The survey experiment examines (1) the salience of safety culture as associated with different entities in the regulatory regime, (2) the impact of personalisation, primacy, and implementation intentions on the predicted efficacy of (a) inspection processes and (b) notices; and (3) the effect of using different messengers to deliver safety messages.
