abstract: "Unemployment and underemployment remain a major global developmental burden, especially in low-and-middle income countries (LMICs). Public works programmes (PWPs) have become an increasingly available policy option in tackling this socio-economic menace, and also as a social protection tool. This study analyses the impacts of Labour Intensive Public Works (LIPW) Programme on welfare in Ghana. This programme is being undertaken by the Ministry of Local Government, Decentralisation and Rural Development (MLGDRD) with funding from the World Bank. The LIPW programme provides seasonal paid employment to selected households/individuals located in project communities. The programme is “designed to support the creation, rehabilitation, and maintenance of public or community assets including (1) rural feeder and access roads, labelled Feeder Roads (F/Rs), (2) basic water infrastructure (small earth dams and dugouts) – labelled Small Earth Dams (SEDs), and (3) environmental degradation and climate change mitigation activities (reforestation and afforestation, catchment and watershed protection, and biodiversity conservation), labelled Climate Change Mitigation Interventions (CCMIs).” Households and individuals residing in randomly selected communities to participate in the programme will be compared to non-programme (comparison) communities. Before-programme household characteristics including welfare indicators will be used to check the similarities and differences (i.e., balance of cluster-randomized evaluation design) in the communities and households. Difference-in-differences (DiD), intention-to-treat (ITT), ordinary least squares (OLS), analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and instrumental variables (IV) methods will be used to estimate the short-run programme impacts. The short-run programme impacts will further be decomposed based on project types (F/Rs vs. CCMIs vs. SEDs), gender (male vs female) and age (youth vs aged) of households in order to identify the most effective intervention option (i.e. heterogeneous effects). The study also seeks to understand the possible pathways through which LIPW can affect welfare in Ghana."
