abstract: "How to motivate the implementation of better management practices? Benchmarking -- comparing relative performance and practices -- is a widely advocated but under-studied strategy. Theoretically, managers fail to leverage existing information and do not implement better management practices, mainly due to two reasons. For one, managers might suffer from information frictions and do not know the existence of better management practices. For the other, managers might pay limited attention to some practices and hold false beliefs over how those practices contribute to performance. Benchmarking works under both scenarios and motivates managers to implement better management practice by directly providing information as well as demonstrating the relationship between practices and performance. Following this line of reasoning, benchmarking is more likely to facilitate practice implementation for businesses with lower performance. Also, benchmarking has a stronger effect on practices to which business owners are more inattentive. To investigate the causal impact of benchmarking, we carried out a randomized controlled experiment among small business owners operating cooked food stalls in Singapore. Every owner was informed of their own performance. Additionally, treatment owners were offered with their relative performance and practices of top performers. The experiment will conclude in 2021 with visits to observe the treatment effect on practices and performance."
