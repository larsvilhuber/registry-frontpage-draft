abstract: "A central choice in designing social comparison is whether to provide an aggregated reference point or the distribution of peer performance. To test the performance effects of this design choice in the workplace, we will conduct a field experiment with a German retail chain. We randomly assign store employees to a control group that only receives information about their own performance, one treatment group that additionally gets information about the aggregate performance (median) of the other employees and a second treatment group that receives the whole performance distribution (deciles). We expect both treatments to increase the performance of the employees. As we introduce relative performance information in an ahead-seeking environment, we expect that providing information on peer performance will increase performance variance and that providing the median will lead to a larger performance variance than providing the performance distribution. This is important because higher performance variance might allow to identify top performers, but at the same time also carries the risk to create disutility due to inequality."
