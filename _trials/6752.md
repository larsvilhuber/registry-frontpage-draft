abstract: "We propose to evaluate the delivery of psychotherapy to low-income adults via audio, text messaging and video calls with licensed therapists. This pilot study will examine if incentives need to be adjusted for the full study in order to create sufficient usage of online mental health services as well as adequate completion rates of surveys assessing mental well-being. We will also assess whether survey questions need to be adjusted for clarity and accuracy of information. The planned output of this study will inform the survey design and incentive structure in separate randomized control trials to be designed and conducted after the close of this study."
