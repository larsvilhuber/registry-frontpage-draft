abstract: "We investigate the connection between risk preferences and demand for insurance by asking three questions. First, are the identified behavioral constructs related to risk aversion—utility curvature, probability weighting, certainty effect and loss aversion—able to accurately predict an individual’s desired level of insurance? Second, given that there is some predictive power to these behavioral factors, which factor or combination of factors has the best predictive power? Third, which of the different decision models proposed in the literature can best predict the demand for insurance?. We will conduct an incentive compatible experiment in which we elicit these behavioral motives using lottery-based multiple price lists and ask subjects to make a number of insurance choices of varying prices and loss probabilities. We then conduct various analyses to answer the three questions stated above. "
