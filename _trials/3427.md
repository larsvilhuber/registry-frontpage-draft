abstract: "Misreporting of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) incidence presents an important challenge for IPV research. Women may under-report IPV incidence in direct questioning surveys because of embarrassment, stigma, adverse consequences associated with reporting, and lack of awareness. We assess the validity of responses to IPV questions using three different methods. We use a experimental design to compare: (i) a face-to-face and standard questionnaire, (ii) list experiments, and (iii) a self-reported questionnaire using a ballot and a box."
