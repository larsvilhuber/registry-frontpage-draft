abstract: "Parental leave policies in Japan allow both mothers and fathers to take paid leave for up to 12 months. However, the uptake rate among fathers remains relatively low. In collaboration with various firms, we are conducting field experiments to investigate the impact of seminars designed to encourage the utilization of paternity leave among male workers. Additionally, we are examining the influence of social norms by experimentally varying the information provided about the views of other workers and managers regarding the use of paternity leave."
