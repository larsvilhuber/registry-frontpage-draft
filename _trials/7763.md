abstract: "We evaluate the effect of providing voters with a set of information about candidates' curriculum. The information set is comprised of basic information derived from candidates’ curriculum (education, work, and political experience). The set mimics transparency requirements introduced by the recently introduced Italian law against corruption (“Legge spazzacorrotti”).
To evaluate the informational effect on voting behavior we organized a dedicated campaign on transparency of the candidates. The evaluation is made trough a panel survey experiment where we will expose treatment group individuals to the campaign while covering the campaign to control group individuals. The informational treatment is an invitation to visit a website with information about candidates.
