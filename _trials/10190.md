abstract: "We experimentally study the impact of digitizing bureaucratic decision-making on performance of small- and medium-sized firms (SMEs) in Ghana. State and local governments often contract out development projects to SMEs – an important environment where fast-digital technology that meaningfully facilitates bureaucratic decision-making on projects will not only improve government’s capacity, but also have the potential to reduce frictions via timely processing and payments for projects to SMEs, with significant implications for increased firm productivity and project outcomes. We partner with the Ministry of Local Government and its technology solutions provider, Casantey Business Solutions Group Ltd., to design and evaluate the impact of a cloud-based solution technology that reduces bureaucratic bottlenecks and uniquely features two structural components (i) addresses coordination failures vs (ii) addresses payment failures. We randomly assign a large pool of select firm-linked projects to the solution technology to uplift projects administration and payments, and carefully measure firm performance.
Research questions—This research seeks to answer two questions:
1.	Whether digitizing bureaucratic decision-making can improve firm’s productivity and performance, and 
2.	How much of improvement in firm’s performance are due to coordination frictions and/or payments concerns?
