abstract: "We study the impact of technology on the collection of property taxes across local governments in Ghana. The technology assists local tax collectors in finding the properties, but also allows improved monitoring of the collectors' activities in the field. At the same time, the technology creates a digital information trail for any payment received, and prints uniquely identifiable receipts as proof of payment. Our primary outcomes of interest are delivery of bills and payments by households."
