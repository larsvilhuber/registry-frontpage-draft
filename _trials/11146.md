abstract: "A well-known problem in the scientific community is the 'Knapsack Problem', which essentially deals with how to fit objects of varying dimensions, and worth different values, into a space with a limited capacity (the knapsack). In general, this problem has been encountered in a number of applications ranging from filling cargo in an airplane, to selling advertisement slots on the internet or on television. Recently, there has been an expanding volume of research in the application of the Knapsack Problem in the context of blockchains; specifically, this research seeks to examine how transactions of varying data sizes can efficiently be allocated into a block with limited data capacity. 

Our project focuses on developing 'Knapsack Auctions': a mechanism to allocate transactions to blocks that factors in asymmetric information between participants in a blockchain. This project has both a theoretical and an experimental component. While the theory provides broad guidelines on how to construct a Knapsack Auction, it has gaps relating to the behavioral responses of agents. To fill this gap, we conduct experiments on three different versions of the Knapsack Auction: the discriminatory-price auction, the generalized second-price (GSP) auction and the uniform-price auction. There are three central issues the experiments seek to address: first, which of the 3 auction versions yields the highest revenue for the seller; second, whether the uniform price auction outcomes conform to theoretical prediction of truthful bidding ; and third, the extent to which the discriminatory and GSP auctions result in under-bidding.
