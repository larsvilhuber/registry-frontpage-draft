abstract: "Women turnout at a lower rate to vote in elections compared to men in many societies. We investigate if the low turnout is the result of misbeliefs about social norms or misbeliefs of men about how women vote. We plan implement two interventions: (i) provide correct information support for women voting among men of the community, and (ii) correct beliefs about alignment between candidate choices of women and men in elections. We will study the effect of these interventions on turnout decisions of women. "
