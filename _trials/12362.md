abstract: "This research investigates the efficacy of public service advertisements in promoting personal carbon accounts, shaping public attitudes towards climate change, and enhancing pro-social behavior. As environmental degradation and climate change become increasingly pressing, it is essential to stimulate behavioral changes at individual and societal levels. Personal carbon accounts, offering individuals the means to track and manage their carbon emissions, represent a potential tool for promoting such sustainable behavior. However, their adoption hinges on public awareness and attitudes.

In this study, we execute a randomized controlled trial involving viewers of a large online TV platform. These participants are randomized into a control group and a treatment group, with the latter exposed to a series of public service advertisements promoting personal carbon accounts. Subsequently, we assess their attitudes and behaviors through a survey.

Our results offer significant implications for environmental policy, advertising strategies, and public education campaigns aimed at encouraging sustainable behavior and mitigating climate change. "
