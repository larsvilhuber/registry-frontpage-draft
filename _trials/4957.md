abstract: "Small and medium enterprises are at risk of ransomware attacks and phishing attacks on their business IT systems. 
Businesses can protect themselves by downloading software updates as soon as they become available, by regularly backing up their data and by avoiding clicking on links to unfamiliar URLs in emails. Many small and medium enterprises are unaware of these simple steps that could help protect their business. The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) provides advice for small businesses and publishes this on its website www.cyber.gov.au. ACSC is interested in how best to present this information and advice so that it is maximally effective in improving awareness and behavioural change. BETA worked with the ACSC to conduct a trial aimed to test advice on phishing, downloading updates and backing up data. We tested presenting this advice in different formats: including plain text, infographics and an interactive quiz with infographic.
