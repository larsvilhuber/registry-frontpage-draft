abstract: "In this study we contribute to the growing economic literature on the extent to which subjective well-being aligns with observed
choices in the context of a straightforward social preference experiment. This is important as prior research has shown that while
choice and predicted subjective well-being often align, individuals do not exclusively maximize subjective well-being. Further, it has
been shown that reported subjective well-being can be influenced by question order as well as other factors.

We test whether these results hold in a straightforward experimental setting. Moreover, we test a novel question: whether observed
choice is influenced by stated satisfaction. To do so, we develop an online experiment building on Diaz et al. (2023) and examine
whether stated satisfaction aligns with observed choice, and vice versa.

Specifically, participants encounter various payment-profiles; in each profile, the participantâ€™s payment is held constant while the
payment of an anonymous, randomly-assigned other experimental participant varies. There are two main tasks. In one, participants
choose their preferred payment-profile; in the other, participants state their satisfaction with each payment-profile. To test for order
effects, we vary the order in which participants complete the two main tasks.
