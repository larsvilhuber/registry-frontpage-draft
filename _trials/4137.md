abstract: "This project tests the effect of microtargeting of political messaging in election campaigns in the Philippines. It explores how messaging affects voter preferences and beliefs.

The core of the project - conducted in collaboration with a political party - relies on conducting an informational treatment in the context of the 2019 Senatorial elections in the province of Laguna in the Philippines.  Voters in randomly selected villages will receive scripted door-to-door visits by party volunteers. Voter in a randomly selected subset of those villages will further receive messages emphasising positive emotions. 

The project seeks to answer questions such as: 

1. What are the effects of door-to-door visits of party volunteers on voters beliefs and vote choices?
2. What the effects of positive campaign messages on voters beliefs and vote choices?

We will also estimate key parameters of a structural model of vote choice based on elicitation of voters beliefs and heterogenous preferences for policy.
