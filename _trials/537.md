abstract: "Domestic violence refers to all incidents of violence and abuse between family members and those who are, or have been, in an intimate relationship. This includes physical, psychological, sexual, financial and emotional abuse. Domestic violence is estimated to cost the public purse in excess of Â£5 billion every year (Walby, 2004), not including the intangible, long-term, costs of trauma and emotional suffering for children, families and communities.
Project 360 is the first randomised-control trial of a multi-agency approach to dealing with repeat domestic violence in the UK. 
Following current procedure, households assessed as high risk by responding police officers are provided with assistance from the Domestic Abuse Support Team (DAST). However, these households make up only four percent of the cases mentioned above. The remaining medium and low risk households do not receive DAST assistance unless seven or more incidents occur within the preceding 365 days. Project 360 extends the service currently offered through DAST by: 1) providing an intervention to households which do not qualify under current procedures; 2) reducing the response time of first contact with victims (currently seven days, on average, for DAST); 3) for households with children, expanding the intervention to pass information directly to schools.
The experimental design of Project 360 will allow us to estimate the causal effect of the intervention on a number of outcomes reflecting the impact on households, victims and children. Combining these outcomes with information on public expenditures we will provide a full cost-benefit analysis of the programme.
