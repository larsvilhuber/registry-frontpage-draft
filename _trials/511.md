abstract: "Teenage pregnancies are common in many low-income countries, but the reasons for why teenage girls become pregnant are not well understood. This is particularly unfortunate in a low-income context where pregnancy among young girls can result in illegal and often dangerous abortions, the spread of HIV/AIDS and, more generally, poor health, educational, and economic outcomes.

The present study takes place in Tanzania and investigates the fertility and economic decisions of girls when they are on the verge of making two of the most important decisions in their lives: what to do when leaving school and whether to start childbearing. 

The present project investigates whether early childbearing reflects a lack of empowerment among young girls in Tanzania, with a focus on two different empowerment strategies. First, we offer an information treatment where young girls are targeted with detailed and extensive information about reproductive health, gender equality, and rights. Second, we offer an opportunity treatment where young girls are targeted with entrepreneurship training to improve their skills on how to run a business. Both treatments aim at empowering girls, but through different channels. The information treatment represents in many ways the classical approach in the field, where the underlying idea is that teenage pregnancies reflect lack of relevant information and personal control. The opportunity treatment, on the other hand, investigates whether teenage pregnancies to a large extent reflect a lack of economic opportunities. By comparing these two treatments, the study will provide novel insights on the relative importance of providing information and opportunities to adolescent girls, which is important both from a theoretical and a policy perspective. In addition, since there may be important complementarities in how the two treatments work, we also offer a cross-treatment to a subsample of the girls. 

An ultimate goal of this research project is to inform the design of sound policies, and we are thus particularly careful to develop a cost-effective intervention with scaling-up potential: all treatments are evaluated and compared not only in terms of impact but also on their relative economic costs. The interventions are based on current practices of our partners, which makes it easier to scale up the successful parts of the project and, more generally, to use the knowledge from the project to improve existing policies.


The main aim of the long-term follow-up is to study whether there are any behavioral and welfare changes due to the training programs, and whether the short term effects on gender equality attitudes and empowerment are persistent. 

The long-term follow-up survey was conducted as telephone interviews one year after the last training session. The survey also includes incentivized questions on patience.
