abstract: "We seek to investigate how decision makers take the intention of another decision maker and the outcome of her choice into account when choosing a reciprocating action. We vary if decision makers observe their partner’s action or only the outcome of the decision. We ask if  decision makers are willing to reveal the action of their partner –his intention –or if they prefer to remain uninformed. If decision makers feel obliged to reward good intentions, they might prefer to remain ignorant about their partner’s action and exploit their willful ignorance by acting selfishly. We further explore how decision makers incorporate their partner’s action and the outcome of her actions into their own decisions when both are observable."
