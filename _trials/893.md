abstract: "This paper describes the analysis plan for a randomized controlled trial evaluating the impact of a lottery-linked savings program on informal workers in Nairobi, Kenya. In 2014, we designed and administered a mobile savings program to 311 randomly sampled residents from the Kibera and Viwandani settlements. This study aims to test the effect of using lotteries to increase demand for commitment savings by comparing the lottery-linked savings program with a standard interest-bearing program. This plan outlines our experimental design, identification strategy, and outcomes of interest."
