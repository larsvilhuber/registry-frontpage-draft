abstract: "The aim of the project is to measure interregional trust, its determinants and associated
expectations in Russia for the first time. We will apply an incentivized online experiment
where the participants from the different regions interact. They will make decisions
in the trust game (Berg et al., 1995). In this game, participants are paired.
The first member of the pair (the trustor) decides whether or not to transfer a certain
amount of money to the second member of the pair (the trustee). Before handed over to the trustee,
the transferred amount is tripled. The matched trustee has then the opportunity to return
any of the received amount to the trustor. Trust by the trustor and trustworthiness of the
trustee allow both members of a pair to get higher earnings (cooperation), while the lack of trust and
trustworthiness (equilibrium behavior) deprives them of such an opportunity. The study
will involve participants from twelve distinct Russian regions. These participants will be recruited
via the online platform "Toloka" (https://toloka.yandex.com/; a provider comparable to MTurk).  
The participants will be matched randomly either with participants from their own city/region or with
participants from one of the other eleven cities/regions. Immediately after the main
experiment, all participants will be asked to state their expectations regarding the
matched trustor’s or trustee’s behavior. Finally, survey questions will be asked related to
participants’ socio-demographic characteristics, trust attitudes, knowledge about the other
cities/regions involved in the study, personality, and economic preferences."
