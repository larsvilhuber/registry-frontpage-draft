abstract: "The aim of this paper is to estimate a possible hiring discrimination against Maghrebi women in the National Capital region of Quebec, Canada. In order to achieve this, we conducted an experiment using the correspondence testing method. Our results suggest that, all other things being equal, the likelihood of being invited to a job interview decreases by 11 percentage points for “Maghrebi women – sounding” compared to “Quebecer women – sounding” candidates. This also suggests the presence of hiring discrimination against Maghrebi women in the National Capital region of Quebec, Canada."
