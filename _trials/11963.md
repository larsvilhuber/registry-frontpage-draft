abstract: "We will conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment at the 2023 Canada’s Outdoor Farm Show (COFS) in Ontario, Canada. The products being tested will be nitrogen stabilizers and fertilizer metering systems accustomed to each participant’s farm via a cost-share Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) mechanism. The outcome variable of interest will be farmers’ bids on the examined products under various between-subjects treatments."
