abstract: "Welfare reform in the UK provides new challenges for social housing providers and their tenants. The implementation of Universal Credit (UC), which replaces Housing Benefit (HB), means that rather than housing providers receiving rental payments directly for those receiving HB, and thus bypassing the tenant, tenants will instead receive a lump sum monthly payment into their bank account and must manage their rent and other outgoings themselves. Some of these customers are the most vulnerable in society and may have difficulty budgeting, particularly on a monthly basis. This poses a challenge for housing providers in meeting income collection targets, but also in ensuring that, as 'social landlords', the most vulnerable tenants are supported in managing their finances.

This study will evaluate a simple intervention to maximise income collection in a single social housing provider in the UK."
