abstract: "This study evaluates a migrant integration program administered in the city of Quelimane, Mozambique. The package consists of three main
elements: access to a job-matching service, help setting up a mobile money account for sending remittances as part of a financial inclusion module, and general information about how to use government services and the city. For the job-matching service, operatives canvass the city to identify employment opportunities, and provides the contact information of potential employers to program recipients."
