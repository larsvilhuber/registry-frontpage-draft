abstract: "We build a new battle-of-the-sexes game based on the seminal work of Akerlorf (1997). Contrary to the classic battle-of-the-sexes games, even if each player chooses the action that maximizes his/her own private preferences, both players get a positive payoff. We define such an issue of the game as the “alienated” issue of the game.
We consider different payoff matrixes (one type of matrix corresponding to a treatment, see Experiment design below) that vary in the number of actions each player can choose. 
Our main expectations are: 
i) when the “unbiased equilibrium” (see below) does not exist, the alienated issue may be a focal point;
ii) when we introduce an “unbiased equilibrium”, it weakens the salience of the alienated issue as a focal point.
