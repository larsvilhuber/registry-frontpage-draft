abstract: "We investigate how to improve job search by analyzing the role of job recommendations and cognitive trainings. We conduct an experiment with job seekers residing in Switzerland who are randomly allocated to different treatment arms. At study entry, each participant creates a skill profile based on survey questions and self-administered behavioral tests. To study skill profiles of occupations and job seekers, some participants receive personalized job recommendations. To study cognitive challenges in the job search, some participants receive cognitive and mindfulness trainings. We investigate the effect of these treatments on unemployment duration and skill mismatch."
