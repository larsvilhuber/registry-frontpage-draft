abstract: "Support for affirmative action policies is typically higher among those who would be favored by them. There are several possible explanations for this gap. One explanation are the different experiences these groups have made, for example in the workplace, while another is that opinions on affirmative action are influenced by in-group favoritism and/or self-serving motives. 
We test these possible explanations in a stylized environment that allows us to vary the stakes individuals have in the decision in favor of or against an affirmative action policy. For this purpose, we conduct an online experiment using a US sample provided by Prolific that is representative with respect to age, gender, and ethnicity. The experiment includes a tournament where half of the tournament participants are randomly assigned to a disadvantaged group. Subjects decide whether or not they prefer a quota rule compensating for that disadvantage to be used in determining the tournament winners.Three different treatments allow us to disentangle impartial preferences for affirmative action from other motives like in-group favoritism and self-interest.
