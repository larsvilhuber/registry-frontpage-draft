abstract: "This RCT evaluates an emergency rental assistance program for tenants at imminent risk of eviction. We partner with Pierce County Human Serviceâ€™s Eviction Prevention Program to facilitate the randomization of eligible applicants to a control group and two treatment arms: 1) case management services plus up to seven months of rental assistance, and 2) rental assistance only.  We study four primary outcomes through linked administrative data and survey data: 1) eviction, 2) homelessness, 3) housing stability, 4) earnings. Our goal is to learn whether households can be targeted ex ante as being more likely to benefit from emergency funds. To do so, we will use an intake survey and linked administrative data to study heterogeneity of effects for two key subgroups: 1) those experiencing transitory v. persistent distress; and 2) those with v. without access to family support."
