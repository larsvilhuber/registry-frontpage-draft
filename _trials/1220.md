abstract: "The end users of new technologies may be distinct from the government administrators in control of procurement. Given growing spending on education technologies in particular, an important question is whether these products, once purchased, are adopted by their end users and are effective in practice. This paper studies the adoption, diffusion, and effects of one type of technology that has received large private-sector investments: school-to-parent communication technologies. Previous research shows that that providing detailed information to parents about their child's academic performance can improve student achievement. Many school districts accomplish this at scale via technology that places student information online, but the adoption of this technology by parents is unknown. 

This paper uses data from a Learning Management System and a two-stage experiment to study the adoption of this technology by parents along extensive and intensive margins, as well as spillovers and effects on student outcomes. I find that a quarter of parents ever use this technology; adoption follows an "S" shape; significant spillovers can occur along intensive but not extensive margins; and there is evidence student grades improve as a result."
