abstract: "Agricultural productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa remains low compared to other areas of the world due to the various constraints that smallholder farmers face. Since addressing one constraint is typically insufficient, we evaluate the effects of bundled agricultural services that tackle multiple constraints for farmers simultaneously. We implement a randomized controlled trial to investigate the impacts of four different service bundles for predominantly female soybean farmers in Northern Ghana. In control communities, WamiAgro Ltd., an agricultural platform, provides farmers with weather information and training on farming practices, as well as the option to sell their soybeans via the platform, termed “Info + Market”. Our three treatment arms add a soil test (“Soil test”), credit for harvesting and threshing (“Credit”), or a soil test and credit for harvesting and threshing (“Soil test + Credit”). We analyze the effects of each treatment on agricultural production, land use, labor demand, household welfare, and women’s influence on household decisions. The hypothesized impact of the soil test is that it will enhance farmers' understanding of their soil's health, enabling them to adjust their input selections and optimize the timing of their applications accordingly. We also expect improvements in self-reported soil quality, changes in production costs, and higher yields. For the credit treatment, we hypothesize that it increases the efficiency of harvesting and threshing. Mechanized threshing preserves the output quality, potentially leading to higher output prices, sales, and income. We predict changes in labor demand and costs, as well as changes in household labor allocation due to increased mechanization. As more than 75% of our participants are female, we expect a positive effect of the credit treatment on women’s income and with that increased influence on consumption and investment decisions. Households may also have lower levels of financial distress. One of the main research questions is whether soil tests and credit services are complements. Once farmers have optimized their inputs and practices based on soil test results, they are more likely to achieve higher yields. However, without sufficient resources for harvesting and threshing, these gains could be lost. Access to credit ensures that farmers can fully capitalize on the improved productivity by enabling timely and efficient post-harvest operations, thus preserving the quality and quantity of the produce. These synergies can improve outcomes in the short term and in future planting seasons."
