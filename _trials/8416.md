abstract: "Female entrepreneurs continue to be underrepresented across the globe, particularly among exporting firms. Thus, promoting female entrepreneurship is regarded as a key policy goal for structural transformation. In that regard, the objective of this intervention is to increase the participation of female-led firms in an export promotion program through the use of different encouragement messages included into the program's email communication campaign. 
The intervention is an information treatment whereby three different e-mails will be sent to a sample of 4343 Tunisian firms to motivate them to participate in an e-commerce training that intends to promote exports of SMEs. The sample will be randomly split into three groups whereby two treatment groups will receive e-mails that, in addition to the general information about the program, contain information that shall encourage female business owners to participate. The first e-mail contains information about free-of-charge childcare services during the classroom trainings that will be offered to the participants. The second email includes information and a link to a video of a successful female Tunisian entrepreneur that talks about her experience as an e-commerce exporter. The third e-mail contains just the information required for registration but no additional encouragement messages and will be sent to the control group. The sample consists of both female and male-led firms, as both the potential effect of female encouragement and a potential backlash (by male business owners) who may feel discouraged by the additional messages shall be investigated.
