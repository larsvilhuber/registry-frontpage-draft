abstract: "Asymmetric information about job applicants' preference—i.e., how interested they are in the jobs they apply for—may cause inefficiency in job matching. The inefficiency can be theoretically reduced by credible signaling of job preference. To empirically examine the effects of job preference signaling, we conduct a large experiment in Bangladesh’s largest online job portal. By applying a novel and ethical randomization design, our experiment estimates the effects of signaling on application-, jobseeker-, and employer-level outcomes. The signaling mechanism in the experiment allows jobseekers to express their interest to few employers. It is essentially identical to what has been implemented in the economist job market by American Economic Association."
