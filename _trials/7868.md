abstract: "The Wilson Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunities (LEO) has partnered with Catholic Social Services of Rapid City (CSS) to evaluate the Uplifting Parents Program (Program UP), an intervention designed to assist lower-income single parents obtain a college degree by providing comprehensive mentoring services and financial support. To evaluate the program, we will use a randomized control trial (RCT) design to test the hypothesis that the program improves graduation rates. Eligible parents are randomly assigned to either Program UP or a control group with 120 in each group. Results from this RCT will be disseminated to policy makers and providers across the county to inform the replication and expansion of programs designed to support single parents. "
