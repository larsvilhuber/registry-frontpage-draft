abstract: "Cash transfers are a popular tool to support households in coping with economic hardship and poverty. The literature documents that cash transfers, both, conditional and unconditional, are effective on a number of domains and thus are also effective in structurally reducing poverty. Yet, evidence on the impact of cash transfers, in particular unconditional ones, on women’s agency, both within and outside the household is still limited. In this study we aim to better understand the effects on women’s agency in the context of women’s savings groups in rural Cote d’Ivoire. The RCT is conducted in the region around Doloa. The study covers 60 randomly selected communities. In each community one savings group of around 15 women was formed. The study covers close to 900 women. In intervention communities, women in savings groups receive a sizable weekly cash transfer over a period of two years. The predictable and frequent income stream of the cash transfers is expected to enable women to more easily save, pay for large household expenditures and business investments, cope with uninsured shocks (thereby reducing risk and enhancing peace of mind), and more generally increase women’s agency within the household and community due to greater access to economic resources. The evaluation combines repeated survey data with administrative data from the savings groups. "
