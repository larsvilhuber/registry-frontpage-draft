abstract: "Severely backlogged courts are often cited as one of the significant roadblocks in the process of entrepreneurship development, efficient resource allocation, and ultimately, economic growth. While the focus of research and policy thus far has been on the role of state capacity behind judicial inefficiency, we have little understanding about the role of economic agents themselves - individuals and firms - in the creation and perpetuation of such inefficiency. In this project, we seek to improve the response rate of litigating parties to court summons in order to speed up backlog resolution of debt recovery disputes through an experimental information intervention. Specifically, we vary the nature of information - generic vs. specific legal counseling - on the outcomes of the debt defaulters and a spillover sample of potentially connected entrepreneurs through changes in both debtor and creditor behavior."
