abstract: "This project aims to understand the drivers of the recent increase in worker collective action in the United States. Since 2020, there has been a surge in union organizing activity, particularly among low-wage retail and service sector workers, that has corresponded with two other shifts in the economy. First, labor market tightness increased dramatically, making it easier for workers to find new jobs. Second, organizing attempts received a great deal of media attention, particularly on social media. Each of these factors could independently facilitate organizing efforts, by lowering the costs of organizing and by improving beliefs about the likelihood that organizing will succeed. These factors could also reinforce each other, further driving increases in willingness to engage in collective action. In a survey experiment, we attempt to disentangle these mechanisms."
