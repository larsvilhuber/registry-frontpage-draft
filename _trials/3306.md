abstract: "The Fund for Wisconsin Scholars (FFWS) was established in 2007 with a founding gift of $175 million from John and Tashia Morgridge. The goal of the FFWS is to increase postsecondary access for economically disadvantaged students in Wisconsin, which the FFWS works to achieve by providing need-based grants. A student is eligible to receive one of these grants if she graduated from a Wisconsin high school, attends a public college or university in the state (including technical colleges) full time, and is eligible to receive a federal Pell Grant. Students do not directly apply for the FFWS grant. Rather, each public institution in Wisconsin uses internal data to identify the set of eligible students enrolled at the school. Each institution then sends its list of eligible students to the Wisconsin Higher Educational Aids Board (HEAB), which randomly assigns students to receive an FFWS offer. Students selected for the FFWS offer receive an award letter that they are instructed to sign and return to the FFWS in order to access the funds—the grants are $1,800/year for students enrolled in two-year institutions and $4,000/year for students at four-year schools. Students not selected for the award are typically unaware they were even eligible. Students who follow the instructions in the award letter have their FFWS automatically renewed—up to a maximum of ten semesters—as long as they meet the initial eligibility criteria and make satisfactory academic progress. The first FFWS grants were awarded in the 2008-09 school year—about 1,200 offers were made that year—and approximately 1,200 offers have been made each subsequent year, allowing us to analyze the effects of the award across several recipient cohorts. As the organization believes program implementation improved after the first cohort, we will only be analyzing the subsequent cohorts. Our outcomes will include employment, wages, and the receipt of means-tested benefits such as SNAP and TANF.  "
