abstract: "Conflicts tend to polarize societies generating divisions among citizens along with identity feelings as "enemy vs. friend" or "offender vs. victim."   These out-group/in-group stereotypes tend to persist when the civil conflict ends, threatening sustainable peacebuilding possibilities.  We investigate whether individuals avoid information and use "moral wiggle room" to excuse selfish behavior.  

The context of the study is Colombia. After the 2016 peace agreement between the Colombian government and Farc combatants, reconstruction efforts have focused on combatants' economic reintegration. Unless the population is willing to support the productive projects initiated by ex-combatants, there is a risk of recidivism. 

We employ an online field experiment to investigate two main questions. First,  we study discriminatory preferences eliciting the WTP for a product produced by either ex-FARC combatants or other farmers.   Second, we allow individuals to decide whether or not to receive information, at zero cost, on the identity of the producer of the good, before revealing their WTP. We test if participants strategically decide to remain ignorant of the identity of the producer to act selfishly. "
