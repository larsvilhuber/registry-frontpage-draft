abstract: "Conservation campaigns often struggle to persuade farmers to adopt pro-environmental practices. From field observations in the SAVA region of Madagascar, conservationists mostly use imperatives and nature-focus messages to encourage pro-environmental actions. Empirical evidence suggests that farmers and conservationists differ in the way they perceive the environment and wildlife, which reveals differences in their values. While conservationist emphasize biospheric or self-trascendence values in their messages, farmers consider the environment as  a means to improve their own well-being, reflecting self-enhancement values or, in other words, an economic thinking. The communication mismatch between the two parties, might be hindering the success of promising environmental campaigns. We designed different message types varying form and content in order to investigate effective message types in persuading farmers towards pro-environmental behavior. We hypothesize that the way messages are communicated matters as farmers may identify themselves more with a certain type of message and thus, follow the desired behavior. By using a survey-based field experiment in the SAVA region of Madagascar, we focus on two forms of communication discussed in recent literature: narratives---a warm but not clear message---or imperatives---a cold but clear message. In each of these two forms, we modify the content making salient self-enhancement or self-trascendence values. While the effects on behavior from a value-mismatch have been previously studied, the novelty of this experimental design and our contribution to the literature lies in the different message types we employ to transmit the messages to incentivize a desired behavior. Madagascar is in need of effective strategies to improve pro-environmental behavior of its population. Hence, from a policy perspective, messages that are more effective are key to make real and long-lasting changes in the mindset of farmers and encourage collective actions in the villages. "
