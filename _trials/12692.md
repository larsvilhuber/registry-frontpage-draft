abstract: "Many workers pursue higher education online to advance their careers. However, employers favor job candidates with in-person degrees in hypothetical matchups (Kaupins et al., 2014; Kohlmeyer et al., 2011; Roberto & Johnson, 2019; Tabatabaei et al., 2014). In open-ended questioning, employers express concerns about online degree holders' soft skills and coursework rigor (Kohlmeyer et al., 2011; Roberto & Johnson, 2019).

These studies rely on employers' self-reported preferences rather than observing their true hiring practices, potentially introducing social desirability bias. Audit correspondence field experiments examine hiring bias in real-life scenarios by generating fictitious resumes and submitting them to actual job openings. Audit studies also eliminate confounders by creating an artificial labor pool with no average differences between groups and randomizing key characteristics (Neumark, 2018).

Two previous audit studies by Deming et al. (2016) and Lennon (2021) examined employer perceptions of online bachelor's degrees using fictitious resumes of young college graduates in their twenties. They found that job candidates with online business degrees received about one-fourth (Deming et al., 2016) to one-half (Lennon, 2021) fewer callbacks than in-person graduates. These findings have limited generalizability because the research designs excluded the modal online student—adult learners in their thirties (Friedman, 2017)—whose long work histories may assure employers of their productivity.

This study aims to determine if Deming et al. and Lennon's results hold for adult learners. Using an audit correspondence field experiment, I test if adult learners with bachelor's degrees from online colleges are less likely to receive a job callback than those with bachelor's degrees from brick-and-mortar colleges. I construct fictitious resumes of adult learners using publicly available resumes from a large job search website and a resume characteristic randomizer (Lahey & Beasley, 2009). I draw from prior literature to covey gender and race (through applicant name – see Gaddis, 2017) and age (through high school graduation date – see Neumark, Burn, and Button, 2019). To depict adult learners' professional experience, I fill the time between high school graduation and college enrollment with ten years of work experience and add four additional years of work experience during college enrollment. Finally, I randomly assign the college type—online or brick-and-mortar—before submitting applications to job openings in business administration.
