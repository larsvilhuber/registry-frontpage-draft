abstract: "This project aims to understand why people may fail to unlearn, i.e. to disregard information once it is shown to be irrelevant. It is motivated by many examples of people continuing to hold incorrect beliefs long after they have been widely discredited, for example the belief that vaccines cause autism. We seek to study whether people are able to "unlearn" effectively by comparing the process of unlearning irrelevant information, through retractions of earlier signals, to the process of learning from new information, through receiving new signals. By focusing on an abstract lab setting, we can ensure that the informational content of retractions is the same as that of new signals. Our design also allows us to test whether acting on previous information affects the ability to unlearn it, one possible mechanism, as well as whether receiving a retraction affects learning from subsequent information. We will also use the opportunity of observing beliefs at high frequency to add to existing evidence on how learning deviates from a Bayesian benchmark more generally."
