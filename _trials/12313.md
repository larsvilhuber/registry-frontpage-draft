abstract: "Trust in experts is historically low. Understanding the determinants of trust in experts is therefore a first-order concern. We experimentally vary perceptions of both the expertise and bias of a sender of information to understand whether these affect belief updating. We focus on updating about expected future inflation, a particularly important value for the public to be aware of."
