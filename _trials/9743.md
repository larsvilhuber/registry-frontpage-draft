abstract: "This study examines how being offered the COVID-19 vaccine from a nurse conducting a home visit affects vaccine uptake compared to the standard open offer of vaccination at health facilities. In collaboration with Kisumu County Health Department, this project sends nurses to conduct home visits and inform residents that they are offering the vaccine at a nearby location in the community. Participants are randomly assigned to nurse visits that are unannounced or announced in advance by enumerators conducting a household survey. The study will examine whether there are differences in vaccination rates when information about the visit is provided in advance. The primary outcome of interest is vaccination rate, comparing both vaccination rates between the groups that received a home visit (announced and unannounced) from a nurse, and each nurse visit group to a control group where people can access vaccines at a local health facility."
