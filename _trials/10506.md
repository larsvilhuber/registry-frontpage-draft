abstract: "Nowadays, many successful video games feature "loot boxes" that, just like gambling, offer random rewards to be used in-game. In 2020 alone such loot boxes generated $15 billion of worldwide revenue. There is an increasing public concern, however, that video game developers design loot boxes in a way to make gamers "overpay" for the typically small chance of getting the reward. We single out two features of loot boxes that might result in gamers overestimating the probability of winning the reward and, consequently, paying too much. First, developers typically do not disclose the odds, but provide gamers only with an interval-censored distribution of rewards. Second, in many games there is a public announcement whenever someone wins a reward, which results gamers observing a selected sample of the reward distribution. In a controlled laboratory experiment, we systematically study the effect of either feature, as well as combinations thereof, on the willigness-to-pay for (monetary) lotteries."
