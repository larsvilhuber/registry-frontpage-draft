abstract: "We cooperated with a pricing-solutions company to run in-store price experiments at a large, Midwestern grocery chain. The experiments ran for for 35 weeks, 11 weeks for the first wave, and 24 weeks for the second wave. During these two waves, 409 test products received test prices across 82 test stores. Test prices were reviewed weekly for each test product–store, whereupon the retailer either posted a new experimental price or randomly kept the current price. With the exception of test products at test stores during the experiment, all other prices were business-as-usual, “observational” prices, which were independent of test-price updates and outcomes. Notably, test products and test stores were not chosen at random: test products had higher revenue, and test stores came from the larger of the retailer’s two markets. Instead, price randomization occurred at the product–store–week-year level.
