abstract: "This paper considers the policy question of how cartels should be fined, building on a recent theoretical literature. We compare three different designs for cartel fines on the formation and pricing behavior of cartels theoretically and using a laboratory experiment. The three fining regimes are based on i) profits, ii) revenue, and iii) overcharge. The theoretical findings suggest that the revenue-regime will result in prices above the monopoly level, while the overcharge-regime will keep cartel prices below the monopoly level. Additionally, we expect deterrence to be the greatest under the overcharge regime, and equal under the profit and revenue regimes. We design an experiment that provides a test of our predictions."
