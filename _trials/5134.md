abstract: "Mass media campaigns can be an effective way of producing positive health-related behavior change across large populations Mass media campaigns allow for the integration of standardized repeated messages in an entertaining format, invoking cognitive or emotional responses. Educational mass-media to promote positive behavior change on radio, film, or television is also known as edutainment. Edutainment has been associated with improved knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to HIV/AIDS, fertility, and family planning in Mexico, South Africa, Tanzania, Brazil, Nigeria, and India. However, to date there have been few rigorous studies on the effectiveness of edutainment to improve women’s outcomes with respect to gender-based violence (GBV) or intimate partner violence (IPV). 

This evaluation contributes to the sparse literature by evaluating the impact of a popular TV series in West Africa, C’est la vie!, on knowledge, attitudes and practices related to GBV, including IPV, and sexual and reproductive health. The study is conducted in rural Senegal, where populations have low exposure to the series and new dubbing into local languages provides a unique opportunity to experimentally test the effectiveness of C’est la vie!. The target group for the intervention are women aged 14 to 34 years old. The evaluation is a cluster-randomized controlled trial (cRCT) design by randomly assigning rural villages to three arms: 1) C’est la vie! screenings via film clubs, 2) same as arm 1 with the addition of post-discussion groups and interactive workshops reinforcing messages, and 3) a placebo film screened identically to arm 1 with no related themes to outcomes of the study. A cross cutting treatment will encourage the partners of target to attend the screenings in half of each study arm. In addition to the RCT, a process evaluation accompanies the evaluation to unpack impact pathways and explore participants experience with the film clubs. The original treatment screenings includes season 1 of C’est la vie!, or approximately 26 episodes, which screened in groups of three (1.5 hours total or 25 min each) on a bi-monthly basis. In March 2020, the intervention was interrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, due to presidential decree in Senegal to close public schools and prohibiting gatherings of more than 10 people. With approximately two-thirds of the intervention completed, the program will be converted to podcasts of 10-20 minutes via a free hotline in June 2020. The podcasts will comprise the final episodes of season 1, and season 2. An intermediate phone survey will be undertaken in June 2020 to capture the initial program impacts, and an in-person endline expected for November to December 2020 after the full intervention is implemented.
