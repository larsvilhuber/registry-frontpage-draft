abstract: "The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to measure corruption in the delivery of subsidized health products in a developing country context, and to evaluate four schemes to increase pass-through of public health subsidies to their intended beneficiaries: vouchers (so that health workers do not have control over the subsidized products themselves); flat bonus pay for health workers charged with delivering the subsidies; threats of top-down audits; and, increasing the salience of the budget constraint. We measure pass-through through a rich set of data, including (1) home surveys of eligible women (registered prenatal care clients), (2) informal interviews with community members, and (3) decoy “mystery client” visits in which ineligible men attempted to obtain subsidized products from health centers. The trial involves 72 health centers from one (undisclosed) region of Ghana."
