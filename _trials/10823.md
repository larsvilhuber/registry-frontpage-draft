abstract: "This study elicits consumers' preferences for organic and local attributes of apples and also examines the effect of information provision and taste. Subjects are recruited from the population of the wider area of Zagreb in Croatia and participate in a second price auction where they bid to buy 1 kilo of apples. Subjects are randomly assigned to one of the following treatments, where we vary on a between-subjects basis the apples available for auction. Subjects  bid simultaneously for two of the apples:

Treatment 1: Organic - Local apple vs. Conventional - Local apple
Treatment 2: Organic - Local apple vs. Organic - non-Local apple
Treatment 3: Conventional - non-Local apple vs. Conventional - Local apple
Treatment 4: Conventional - non-Local apple vs. Organic - non-Local apple

Subjects go through three rounds of auctions. In the first round they have no information about the attributes of the apples and they are asked to bid based on appearance only. In Round 2, they receive information about the apples and in Round 3 they get to taste the apples before they bid. "
