abstract: "We study whether the social relationship between the employer and the employee is an important determinant of gift exchange. Inspired by the anthropological literature, which claims that only monetary transfers that take place in a close and intimate social relationship can be considered gifts, we implement two gift-exchange field experiment which exogenously manipulate the degree of closeness and intimacy between the employer and employees. We aim to revisit existing field studies from this novel point of view to study whether the existence and degree of the employer-employee social relationship can organize the conflicting results in gift-exchange field studies."
