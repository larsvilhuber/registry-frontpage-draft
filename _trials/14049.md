abstract: "Media content is often distorted towards sensensationalist content (as compared to reality) and a growing body of evidence suggests that an important reason for this is the demand side. Digitalization enables journalists to learn about the reading preferences of their audiences in detail and rewards respecting reader preferences in content production much stronger than traditional news settings. Could the shift in incentives thus amplify certain the sensationalst bias in the media? And if so, what would be the consequences for consumers?

To tackle these questions, this study builds on results from the project "Does Digitalization Enhance (Negativity) Bias of the News Media? Investigating Journalistic Decision Making Under Different Incentive Schemes", which was pre-registered under the RCT ID AEARCTR-0008658. In two (partially connected) experiments I investigate journaistic content choices and the reactions of readers to them. For the first experiment, journalists are recruited as participants and randomly allocated to different incentive schemes. The journalists make content choices, which are in the second experiment randomly shown to a group of readers. The second experiment serves to analyze the effects of jounalistic content choices on readers emotions, beliefs and attitudes."
