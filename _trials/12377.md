abstract: "The study is a phase-in cluster randomized control trial mixed-methods impact evaluation of the Mali cash plus programme targeted to members of women’s savings groups (WSG) in three regions of the country: Koulikoro, Ségou, and Sikasso. The overall objective is to mitigate the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19. Members of the savings groups will receive five unconditional cash transfers over the course of six months, complemented with sensitization measures on key family practices and capacity development on business skills, women’s rights, leadership, and decision-making. Key outcomes areas include household consumption and food security; child related outcomes (nutrition, health care, early childhood development, child protection); gender related outcomes (women’s empowerment, women’s participation in agriculture and business activities, intra-household time use, gender norms and intimate partner violence,); and indicators at WSG level (membership, participation rates, amounts received, savings and credit amounts). Key contextual factors hypothesized to moderate programme impact include gender norms, religion, marital status/household structure (monogamy vs polygamy). Quantitative baseline and endline data collections include household, women’s, community and WSG questionnaires, while qualitative components include focus groups discussions with beneficiaries, and in-depth interviews with beneficiaries, women’s groups and community leaders, programme staff, and other key social protection stakeholders. Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to estimate impacts using baseline and endline surveys. The study will be carried out over about two years starting in April 2022, led by the UNICEF Innocenti – Global Office of Research and Foresight (UNICEF Innocenti), in collaboration with UNICEF Mali, Groupement d'Intérêt Scientifique des Statisticiens Économistes (GISSE) and l'Institut National de la Statistique (INSTAT)."
