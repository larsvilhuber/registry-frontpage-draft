abstract: "The growing concern of skills mismatch between workers and jobs in many developed countries has increased the amount of investment into vocational training programs for adults. In this project, we will implement a correspondence study in France to evaluate the impact of undertaking vocational training on job seekers’ success on the labor market, and how it compares with holding more classic educational qualifications. In some occupations, there is more tightness than others, and our study aims to understand firms’ responses to this and how it interacts with different types of training. We plan to send out several fictitious CVs to vacancy job postings, in which we will randomly vary the level of experience and the amount of training, either with more classic education degrees or with vocational-training program for adults, while keeping other characteristics similar.
