abstract: "We measure the willingness to pay for policies aimed at achieving climate change mitigation and energy security goals. These policies are set in the context of the residential energy and transport sectors in Poland. As of the 2020s, the Polish economy was one of the most fossil-fuel dependent in the EU. The residential sector accounted for one of the largest shares of energy consumption (29%), followed by transport (24%). Almost 50% of all households used individual heating sources, usually based on ineffective, solid fuels. Additionally, Polandâ€™s car fleet was the oldest and sixth largest in the EU. Old cars were important contributors to air pollution, particularly in areas with a high density of transport networks. Finally, energy security has become a more pressing issue since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. As Poland remained a major importer of Russian oil and gas, the uninterrupted supply of fuels (and prices) became a public concern. Taking into account the institutional setting in Poland, we study the willingness to pay for four attributes: (1) mitigation of climate change impacts (2) decrease in the mortality rate due to poor air quality (3) limited imports of gas and oil from Russia (4) uninterrupted availability of energy supply. We use the experiment to evaluate if achieving support for climate policy goals is more viable by environmental (attributes 1-2), or energy security (3-4) framing. We use the experiment to evaluate the acceptance of the introduction of environmental fee systems (e.g. a carbon tax or emission trading)."
