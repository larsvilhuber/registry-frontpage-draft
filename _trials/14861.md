abstract: "In this project, we will investigate the impact of workplace excellence rewards on workersâ€™ productivity, attendance, earnings, and firm culture. It would be conducted in rural Uttar Pradesh, India in partnership with a large carpet producing firm, in 150 small firms that the partner firm sources from. The intervention will randomize whether and how bonuses for workplace excellence worth about 10% of the average worker wage are allocated. We would randomize, at the firm-level, whether bonuses for carpet workers are allocated (a) based on managerial discretion or (b) worker voting. We will use data on productivity, attendance, earnings, and perceptions about firm culture to understand whether and how different systems of rewarding workers can improve outcomes for workers and firms."
