abstract: "Parental involvement may hinder the meritocracy of otherwise merit based competitions among children. However, believing that other parents will help their children, interference may occur to ensure that one's child is not left at a disadvantage. This study aims to investigate to what degree parents want to provide their child an advantage in an originally meritocratic competition, and how their choice of whether or not to interfere in the competition (i.e. provide help) is affected by the possibility that other parents may help their children. If you as a parent were given the possibility to give your child an advantage, would you do it? Would you compromise the meritocracy of a competition to benefit your child?

To study this potential mechanism for why parents interfere in their children's educational attainment, I  conduct a controlled lab-in-the-field experiment in Norwegian secondary schools. The subjects are 10th grade students and their parents."
