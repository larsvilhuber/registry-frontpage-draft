abstract: "The aim of this project is to investigate economic preferences and rationality among individuals diagnosed with psychiatric disorders. We will use two widely recognized experimental paradigms in the literature, namely social decision-making (eg., Fisman et al., 2007) and risk decision-making tasks (eg., Choi et al., 2007), to evaluate the decision-making abilities of psychiatric patients. The study will recruit individuals diagnosed with several common types of psychiatric disorders according to ICD-10 diagnostic criteria, along with demographically-matched normal controls. By taking an interdisciplinary approach, we hope to identify potential decision deficits among the patients, as well as commonalities and differences among individuals diagnosed with different types of psychiatric disorders, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms of psychiatric diseases. Ultimately, this research will not only advance our understanding of mental disorders but also provide new insights into the heterogeneity of economic preferences and rationality among human behaviors. The experiment will be conducted only if we obtain consent from the patient (consent from the patient's family is required for those without full capacity). The data will be collected from clinical inpatients and outpatients."
