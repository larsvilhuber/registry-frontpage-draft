abstract: "The United States is unique in that important legal actors are selected by popular elections. As a consequence, elections act as the primary accountability mechanism for the substantial discretion prosecutors exercise. Numerous problems can be expected - - voters do not have the human capital to properly evaluate prosecutor decision making and they are not incentivized to become informed (i.e., free riding). Nevertheless, recent empirical evidence suggests that prosecutors respond to the election cycle. Here, I investigate further whether elections encourage prosecutors to be responsive to their community's interest. To do so, I will conduct a randomized control trial where prosecutor offices will be contacted to provide basic information about their office. The outcome variable of interest is whether or not any employee of the office responds to the information request. Response rates of prosecutors with a re-election in the upcoming election cycle (in 2020) will be compared to those without elections in the year will be compared. In addition, offices run by appointed prosecutors will be considered. "
