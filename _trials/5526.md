abstract: "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global concern, which the World Health Organisation has named one of the biggest threats to global health, food security and development today. The over-prescription of antibiotics is a key driver of AMR. Unnecessary prescriptions are especially problematic in New Zealand, which had the 7th highest community prescription rate in the OECD in 2015. 

The Behavioural Insights Team's previous work in the UK has shown that a letter with personalised feedback to practices can reduce prescriptions of unnecessary antibiotics, and a recent replication in Australia by the Behavioural Economics Team of the Australian Government was even more effective by targeting individual General Practitioners (GPs). 

The current trial is being conducted by BIT, and draws on this prior work to tailor it to the New Zealand context. The trial aims to test whether personalised feedback to New Zealand GPs, in the form of a letter, can reduce prescriptions of unnecessary antibiotics. The trial will also test the impact on prescribing to MƒÅori and Pacific patients, who tend to experience worse health outcomes. "
