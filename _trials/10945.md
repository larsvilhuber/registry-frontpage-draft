abstract: "Information nudges have been widely used to influence behavior but there is a lack of understanding of the associated mechanisms and the optimal design. We distinguish active and passive information nudges and show that the former is more effective in promoting defensive behaviors such as outdoor time and mask-wearing against air pollution, and does so through reducing inattention. We conduct a large-scale field experiment through randomized control trails in Northern China with treatments of free masks and information nudges throughout a winter heating season when pollution was the heaviest. Unlike passive information nudges where participants were simply provided information about pollution and the associated health damages and required defensive measures, active nudges require participants to perform an easy task such as matching pollution levels with the corresponding health damages as well as the necessity to wear facemasks. 
	We find strong evidence that the active information nudges improve outdoor and mask-wearing behaviors and reduce respiratory and cardiovascular related hospital visits, whereas passive nudges do not have significant effects. We develop parametric and nonparametric measures of (daily) inattention to air pollution and inattention to the associated health damages, and find that both types of inattention lead to suboptimal defensive behaviors. Active information nudges reduce inattention levels, especially on high pollution days, and a sizable proportion of the active nudgesâ€™ positive effects is achieved through reduced inattention. In contrast, while providing free masks leads to more mask-wearing on smog days, it does not improve outdoor behavior or reduce inattention. 
Our findings have important implications for promoting defensive behavior against pollution, and for the design of nudge intervention in general. Our study also highlights an important aspect of defensive behavior that is often ignored in the literature, namely the need to avoid adopting costly defensive behaviors in face of low or no pollution.
