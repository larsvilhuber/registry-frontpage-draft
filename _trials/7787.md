abstract: "It is a common misconception that economics is about money and money only. In reality, economics covers a variety of topics, from financial economics to transportation economics. This study implements a randomized survey-based experiment to evaluate the effect of educational economics videos on K-12 studentsâ€™ understanding of what economics is. The students randomly assigned to the control group will first answer a question regarding the topics studied by economists. Then, they will receive a video that indirectly answers the question: What is studied in economics? The students randomly assigned to the experimental group will first receive the video, then answer the question regarding the topics studied by economists. The hypothesis is that students in the experimental group will accurately identify/select more economics topics than the students in the control group.
