abstract: "This randomized controlled trial (RCT) explores the transformative potential of a targeted teacher training program designed to enhance educational opportunities and learning outcomes for children in Tanzania. Implemented across 10 schools, the intervention equips teachers with advanced pedagogical tools and methodologies to address the unique needs of vulnerable students in core subjects such as English, Mathematics, and Kiswahili. By prioritizing teacher development, the program seeks to translate improved instructional practices into measurable academic benefits for students, particularly those at risk of falling behind.
The study aims to estimate the causal impact of teacher training on both educator performance and student outcomes. Teacher performance will be rigorously assessed through classroom observations, adherence to structured lesson plans, and levels of teacher-student engagement. For students, outcomes will be analyzed across two critical dimensions: (1) access to education, as reflected in changes in school attendance and retention rates (extensive margin), and (2) academic achievement, measured by exam scores and subject-specific proficiency (intensive margin).
Beyond short-term gains, the study adopts a mid-term perspective by tracking participants over one year to evaluate the sustained impact of the intervention. Key areas of focus include long-term academic success, improved retention rates, and enhanced prospects for transitioning to higher levels of education. By shedding light on the effectiveness of targeted teacher training, this research offers valuable insights for shaping policies aimed at narrowing educational disparities and fostering inclusive learning environments.
