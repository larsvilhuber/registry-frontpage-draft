abstract: "Despite the high public benefits of climate smart agricultural practices, individual producers may not adopt them due to lack of perceived individual benefits or insufficient startup capital. In a rare opportunity to more closely align public and private benefits and overcome these initial capital constraints, we secured funding through USDA's Partnerships for Climate Smart Commodities program to evaluate the factors that incentivize adoption of on-farm climate smart practices. Staff from local soil and water conservation districts in four states—Arkansas, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Virginia—have been tasked with recruiting producers to apply for the program. We are conducting a stratified random selection process to offer producers a flat rate of $100 per acre (or animal unit) for any practice that qualifies under USDA guidelines. We will conduct surveys throughout the study period among selected and non-selected producers to evaluate differential adoption of CSA practices in response to these offers and translate those differences into estimated public benefits. We will evaluate whether capital alone appears sufficient to drive adoption of practices, and which practices are most likely (or least likely) to be adopted. We also evaluate the effectiveness of our program on reducing the GHG emissions of agricultural production and effects on agricultural productivity. "
