abstract: "The research goal of this study is to understand whether families are informed about changes to family policies, or whether there are informational gaps that prevent families from fully accounting for these changes in their decision-making. In particular, we want to answer the following research questions: Are mothers informed about family policy changes and the consequences for their household? Are they reconsidering their labor supply choices when a childcare subsidy is introduced? Can personalized and easily accessible information about the policy change influence childcare take-up and maternal labor supply? 

We study these questions in the context of the implementation of a reform that substantially increases childcare subsidies in one region of Switzerland. We implement a field experiment that provides concrete and individualized information to families about the reduction in childcare costs for their household. We further highlight, that this reform might allow to reconsider the current household organization and provide them with calculations of cost changes in the case of employment level increases. We then measure the impact of this intervention on mothersâ€™ labor supply plans, their actual labor supply, and childcare take-up, among other outcomes.
