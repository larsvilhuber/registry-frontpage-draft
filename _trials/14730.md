abstract: "This research investigates the enduring impact of childhood exposure to violence on relationship formation and subsequent intimate partner violence (IPV) as well as other forms of household violence towards children and cowives. I focus on the unique context of Northern Uganda, where thousands of boys and girls were abducted by the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA) during childhood or adolescence between the mid-80s and the mid-2000s. The study leverages the quasi-random nature of the abductions combined with survey data and lab-in-the-field games to understand how relationships are formed differentially based on abduction experiences and the subsequent factors that lead to intimate partner violence. Specifically, I ask: What is the impact of abduction in one’s adolescence on adult partner choice?, What is the impact of own and partner abduction status on violence within the household?, How do psycho-social and economic factors related to abduction contribute to and explain household violence?
