abstract: "This project aims to study whether providing literacy information about mental health increases the demand for mental health support among university students. The demand for mental health support is measured with the WTP for a CBT therapy app and with the demand about specific support services available for students. Additionally, this project investigates the interaction between information and the roots of low demand for mental health support. In particular, the project focuses on the role of students' backgrounds, mental health status, and beliefs affect support-seeking behavior in shaping the demand for mental health support. Among the beliefs, we investigate the role of self and social image concerns about seeking mental health support, the perceived benefits of good mental health for educational and labor market outcomes and the perceived effectiveness of mental health support tools.
