abstract: "In Bonomi, Gennaioli, and Tabellini 2021 we develop a theory of identity politics that builds on two ideas. First, when policy conflict renders a certain social divide (economic or cultural) salient, a voter’s beliefs are tainted by the stereotype of the group he identifies with. Second, culture influences beliefs across many domains. One key prediction of the group is that voters’ beliefs about facts and their policy views are slanted toward the distinctive opinions of the group a person identifies with and in away from the opinions of the outgroup.  By this mechanism, identity is correlated with specific forms of incorrect beliefs and polarization in policy views.  In this study, we plan to ask respondents to answer questions on their: i) identity, ii) factual beliefs, and iii) policy preferences on a range of domains (economic domains: redistribution; cultural domains: immigration, abortion, affirmative action. We also inquire factual beliefs and policy views on trade policy and environmental policy). With such data, we want to test some hypotheses and predictions of the model.
Some of the questions we would like to answer are: 
1.	Does identity predict disagreement in terms of beliefs and policy preferences across economic and cultural domains, and also the extent to which disagreement is correlated across different domains?
2.	Is disagreement stronger for individuals with a strong identity?
3.	Does identity with political parties play a distinct role from identity with social groups (e.g. religious groups or economic classes)?
