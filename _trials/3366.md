abstract: "The choice of residential location is a critical economic decision for households in the United States. Recent research has shown that neighborhood pollution exposures can have significant effects on health outcomes, disproportionately affecting minority households. In this project, we seek to determine the extent to which discrimination in the rental market for housing affects local pollution exposures and contributes to inequity in health outcomes. This study will generate experimental evidence on the impact of discriminatory behavior on housing choices of renters using a major online rental housing platform within a tight radius of plants that emit toxic pollutants in the United States. Our project will use a correspondence study design to elicit differential response rates to housing inquiries on a major online rental housing platform.  In addition to estimating the reduced-form effects of discriminatory behavior on housing choice within our locations, we will simulate a housing search process for thousands of renters that vary in income and preferences for housing and neighborhood attributes.  This welfare-theoretic approach allows us to disentangle the effect of discriminatory behavior on household sorting and estimate its impact on welfare. Utility weights allow us to assign a dollar amount to the welfare effects of these constraints."
