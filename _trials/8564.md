abstract: "Main trial: We investigate the influence of group size and gender composition on collective ethical desicion-making. In an online experiment, groups of 2, 3, 4, or 5 persons have to report unanimously the outcome of a die roll, which determines their monetary payoff. Each composition with respect to the number of men and women in a group is equally likely within each group size. The members of a group see the same video and interact in a video chat. Moreover, we elicit a set of social preferences, a measure of individual honesty, a measure of cognitive ability, and a measure of social cognition.

Follow up treatments: One main finding of the main trial is that all-male groups lie more than almost-all-male groups (i.e. groups with exactly one female member). In these treatments, we investigate two alternative channels that might drive this finding: Gender-specific honesty beliefs and gender-specific image concerns. The two new treatments will again compare the behavior of all-male and almost-all-male groups. They 
use the same design and implementation as the main trial with the following changes: i) the group decision is reached by majority rule (rather than unanimity), and (ii) we focus on triads. "
