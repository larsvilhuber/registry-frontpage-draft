abstract: "This paper studies the role of social learning in farmers’ adoption of improved coffee practices, in the context of training field experiment in Rwanda. While the program improved knowledge of all trained best practices and strengthened social networks, detailed tree audits reveal limited impacts on adoption. We find no evidence of diffusion through farmers’ networks; instead, control households experienced negative spillovers in high treatment concentration areas. This explains much of the 7% higher yields of treatment farmers compared to the control post training. Our results highlight the challenges of information diffusion in agricultural extension programs."
