abstract: "In the invoicing process of economic transactions there may be collusion between seller and buyer when there are apparently beneficial incentives for both parties to under-report invoices.  The growth of electronic invoicing is one mechanism to combat this phenomenon, which may be more common in countries where informal cash transactions are more frequent. The purpose of this trial is twofold. On one hand, we pretend to assess the importance of perceiving direct or indirect benefits from asking for electronic invoices. On the other hand,  we would like to assess the importance attributed to the allocation of revenues to specific items of public spending. The intervention consists of sending emails to several groups of taxpayers. "
