abstract: "This research studies how correcting disinformation disseminated primarily by the state affects political attitudes and beliefs in an autocratic state. In partnership with an independent media organization, the study randomizes revealing truthful information and pointing out state manipulations using fact-checking services and aims to observe any changes to the support of the autocratic regime and opposing political movements and demand for accountability. Given that prior research finds low demand for truthful information, the study lowers the cost of acquiring truthful information by delivering daily fact-checked messages to the recipient using a dedicated channel on a popular social media platform. The study measures the demand to continue receiving the service and its effect on attitudes and beliefs about the current political state. Findings of this research are important in understanding the determinants of political engagement in settings, where citizens have limited options for political activity in forms other than protests and often opt out of the political process altogether.
