abstract: "We explore why women do not contribute to Wikipedia as much as men do. Researchers and the Wikimedia Foundation estimate that Wikipedia editors are predominantly men. This gender gap leads to the biased coverage of women as well as topics important to women, such as women's health. In an intermediate microeconomics class at a large public university in the United States, we will randomly assign Wikipedia articles on economists' biographies or economic concepts to students who can earn bonus points by completing this assignment. Students will also complete a set of games as measurements of personal traits and a survey experiment to explore why we might observe a gender gap in contributions to economic concepts but not in biographies."
