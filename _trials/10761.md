abstract: "Whilst Ghana was one of the first countries to start vaccinating its population against COVID19, less than 30% of the population was fully vaccinated at the end of 2022. To improve COVID-19 vaccine uptake, the government has so far relied on two strategies: sensitization in communities and specific national vaccination days. Against the backdrop of strict budget constraints and the return to normalcy in health-seeking behaviours, we aim to test the effectiveness of leveraging interactions of patients with the healthcare system to reduce misinformation and increase vaccination. We collaborate with the Ghana Health Service to offer vaccination as a default option during routine consultations. To dispel information and encourage vaccination uptake effectively, we test two interventions designed to encourage and equip front-line providers with skills to discuss COVID19 vaccination with patients. We evaluate the effect of the two interventions in a cluster-randomised trial where we allocate 120 facilities to one of three groups: a control group where providers are not asked to offer COVID-19 vaccines; a light engagement group, where providers receive information about COVID19 and vaccines in their facility and we deploy a light monitoring device, and a communication skills building group, where providers receive all the elements of the light intervention, plus training in motivational engagement techniques to encourage vaccination. Our primary outcome will be vaccination uptake and intentions. We will also evaluate the impact of the intervention on patientsâ€™ knowledge, beliefs and satisfaction. We will track the effectiveness of the training on providers as well as the extent to which they apply their training to actual practice. Results will contribute to a nascent evidence base on potential ways to encourage adult vaccination during routine consultations."
