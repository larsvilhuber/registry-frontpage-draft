abstract: "Failure is a social phenomenon. Individuals who attempt an activity and fail visibly have to face a social cost: the stigma of failure. By increasing the cost of visible failures, this stigma may distort individuals’ behaviors. In this study, we investigate the empirical relevance of this hypothesis in a natural, high-stake field setting in urban Cote d’Ivoire: women’s entrepreneurship. Our study has two core objectives. The first is to evaluate if and by how much the stigma of failure may hamper female entrepreneurship. The second is to test an alternative entrepreneurship training module specifically designed to alleviate this barrier."
