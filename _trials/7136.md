abstract: "We use a randomized controlled trial to study the effects of cash grants to vulnerable and poor women in rural Tunisia. The objective is to study whether cash grants can alleviate capital constraints and thereby favor both female entrepreneurship and female empowerment. Beneficiary women were offered an unconditional cash grant of USD 551 (in PPP terms) and a financial training. In addition, a subset of beneficiaries were randomized into a gender dialogue component whereby they could invite their male partner to the training. The objective is to study whether this component can mitigate any negative perceptions or resentments that male partners may have as a result of female economic independence through the grant."
