abstract: "This project aims to investigate the willingness to pay of rice farming households in Vietnam’s Mekong Delta for parametric insurance against heavy rainfall offered by Igloo Insurance. To this end, we elicit households’ willingness to pay for rainfall insurance, using the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak method during the first wave of the Vietnam Rice Farmer Panel Survey. Two randomized experiments are implemented. In the first experiment, a randomly selected sub-sample of respondents receive information about the actual market price of Igloo’s rainfall insurance product. In the second experiment, respondents are offered premium discounts for purchasing the rainfall insurance product after the completion of the WTP, with the value of discounts randomly varied. "
