abstract: "Access to affordable medical treatments may be endangered by the current bargaining system, in which the prices countries pay remain secret. Proponents of price confidentiality claim that it enables price cuts for poorer countries. In a laboratory experiment, we provide empirical evidence on the effects of price transparency in bargaining."
