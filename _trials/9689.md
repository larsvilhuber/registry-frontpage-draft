abstract: "Social media and internet search engines give easy access to information about others. This paper studies the behavioral consequences when individuals know more about others they interact with. In principle, increased knowledge limits the ability of decision makers to signal their type through their actions. Thus, if decision makers want to signal a socially desired type, increased knowledge in turn decreases the supply of socially desired behavior. There are however factors that might lead to "unlearning", such as a belief that people can change or that yesterday's news might be forgotten which can keep reputational incentives strong even as individuals learn more about each other's past. I test the behavioral effect of increased knowledge in an experiment and investigate which factors lead to unlearning."
