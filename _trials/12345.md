abstract: "Digital platforms are reshaping the labor market, offering access to global markets and new income-generating opportunities. Online freelancing, where clients contract jobs to remote workers, presents a powerful mechanism for development, bringing jobs to people all around the world (Lehdonvirta et al., 2019). Yet, most registered individuals never manage to successfully obtain work online, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (Hilbert and Lu, 2020). In devising policies to enhance online workersâ€™ outcomes, a key question is whether poor results come from technical deficiencies or barriers to entry. If the former holds true, workers might require technical training. However, if the latter is the case, facilitating worker engagement with online marketplaces could be sufficient. To test this, we carry out a randomized controlled experiment in El Salvador in which the treatment group received training on the entrepreneurial skills required to engage with online marketplaces (e.g., creating a profile, preparing proposals, and interacting with clients).
