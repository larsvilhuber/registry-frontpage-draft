abstract: "Effective communication skills are essential ingredients for a healthy and cohesive work environment. This study aims to test whether reinforcing these skills via a creative training program offered to white-collar professionals improves workplace climate and enables better social interactions in large corporations. The evaluation sample contains white-collar professionals of all ranks from 20 large corporations in Turkey representing the chemistry, defense, construction, textiles, energy, and finance sectors. The intervention involves a series of workshops where a professional implementing partner uses unique interactive methods, including creative drama and role-playing, to improve social and interpersonal skills. A critical component of the intervention is a series of team exercises following workshop sessions, lasting over eight weeks, managed and monitored by the implementing partner. While the intervention targets all white-collar workers from all ranks, team and department leaders are particularly encouraged to attend."
