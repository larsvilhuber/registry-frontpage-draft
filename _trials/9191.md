abstract: "We provide experimental evidence to assess whether pro-social leading is motivated by altruism or by a less lofty desire to conform with expectations. The evidence from our initial experiment indicates that many individuals' pro-social leading  may be driven by conformity to what they imagine is expected of them by others. This is somewhat counterintuitive as the notion of leadership seems to imply influencing others by surpassing expectations, not simply conforming with them.  But what we observe looks less like inspired boldness and more like stock role-playing."
