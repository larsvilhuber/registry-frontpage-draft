abstract: "Research has shown that female students are less likely to study STEM fields and more likely to perform worse on tests for STEM-related disciplines compared to male students. Previous studies have shown that role model interventions – which expose students to information about inspirational individuals of the same gender, race, or background – could have a positive impact on those students’ academic performance. We conduct a randomized controlled trial in China to determine the effect of a role model intervention on students. Our contribution to the literature is to test the effect not only on cognitive (academic) student outcomes but also on non-cognitive (personality) outcomes. We control for grading bias when measuring cognitive outcomes through an academic exam, and we also control for a myriad of parent and teacher characteristics that may affect student outcomes. "
