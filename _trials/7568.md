abstract: "Low retention rate of Methadone Maintenance Treatment (MMT) is a tough nut and research struggle to encourage patients to attend for MMT regularly. In this experiment, we encourage patients to overcome heroin addiction and maintain regular visit for MMT through group level and individual level cash award. In this context, we examine whether this MMT program (i) increases patients' attendance, (ii) changes patients' time preferences; (iii) improves patients' health condition; and lastly, (iv) improve patients' other living condition."
