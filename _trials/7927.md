abstract: "In this project, we seek to understand minority and female underrepresentation in advanced STEM courses in high school by investigating whether school counselors exhibit racial or gender bias during the course assignment process. We extend the analysis by attempting to disentangle whether any observed bias can be attributed to taste-based discrimination, statistical discrimination, or implicit bias. Using an adapted audit study, we asked a nationally-recruited sample of school counselors to evaluate student transcripts that were identical except for the names on the transcripts, which were varied randomly to suggestively represent a chosen race and gender combination. In order to identify the sources of bias we included three additional experimental conditions. Understanding the underlying sources of racial and gender bias can help stakeholders and policymakers design better solutions to address the bias."
