abstract: "New Mexico Legal Aid (NMLA) currently (before the COVID-19 pandemic) provides one staff attorney each week at the Albuquerque-based, Bernalillo County Metropolitan Courthouse for eviction-related legal services. This offering, also known as a lawyer-for-the-day program (LFTD), allows tenants facing eviction to receive full representation or legal advice before their eviction hearings. In 2019, NMLA served about 275 tenants through the LFTD program. Most of them received little education or introduction to their civil legal rights, and they otherwise would not have been able to access legal help while facing the loss of their homes. There were more eligible tenants than the LFTD service could provide assistance, i.e., there was scarcity in the intervention.

Through this pilot study, NMLA will expand its LFTD offerings through and offer: (1) the same full representation; (2) brief legal advice before the hearing; and (3) basic, written information about tenants’ legal rights in eviction on a randomized basis. NMLA will partner with University of New Mexico School of Law (UNMSOL) faculty and students to increase LFTD staffing. The current scheme only involves on-demand assistance without any lawyer preparation on an eviction matter. In the interest of maximizing case volume—and statistical power—the LFTD team will pull each Monday the docket for the upcoming Wednesday to facilitate intake and identification of as many study-eligible participants as possible. Simple algorithmic randomization performed on-site my service providers will then assign participants to one of the three treatment arms.

After randomization, participants will be invited to respond to up to three surveys every six weeks asking about their housing security status. Although the responses will not be analyzed, the study team will use them to determine the most likely sources of response attrition and whether the responses can be aggregated into a useable index of housing security.

We note here that this incubator proposal is for a pilot version of the full evaluation we hope to implement in 2021 or later. Data of direct relevance to power calculations will be easier to obtain if NMLA (with UNMSOL partners) increases its LFTD attorney presence and beta-tests the complete study operation over 26 weeks (including randomization and follow-up surveys).
