abstract: "The last decade has seen a marked upsurge of research into ‘norm-based feedback’ interventions, which aim to reduce the consumption of some resource by providing users with information about their use compared to e.g. neighbors in their community. As far as we are aware, ours is the first study on the effect of providing such feedback within the waste domain. We run separate randomized controlled trials of accurate and household-specific norm-based feedback on residual (unsorted) waste in two municipalities in western Sweden, Partille and Varberg. In total, some 20,000 single-family households participate, about three-quarters of which are located in Varberg. Our main feedback condition, which we term “static” feedback, replicates the by now standard Opower-style norm and involves comparing each household’s own residual waste (in kilograms per person) with an average among roughly 100 nearby households. We also explore differently presented, “dynamic” feedback motivated by psychological evidence that norms focusing on changes in behavior, rather than snapshot pictures of consumption differences within a population, are more effective at reducing use."
