abstract: "In the U.S., major catastrophes are routinely followed by people offering their thoughts and prayers to those in need. It is, however, unknown how people may choose to substitute or complement such gestures with material help. We examine how charity donations to hurricane victims are affected by giving American donors the option to also send their thoughts and prayers. To perform our analysis, we collect experimental data in the wake of a hurricane We compare monetary donations in a baseline treatment where sending thoughts and prayers is not included in the donorsâ€™ choice set, to donations in a thoughts and prayer treatment, where donors can choose to complement or substitute monetary donations with thoughts or prayers.
