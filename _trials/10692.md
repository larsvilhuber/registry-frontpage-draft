abstract: "EEO-1 reports are mandatory reports that provide a breakdown of the workforce of the firm by race and gender. These reports are filed privately with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and kept confidential. Only aggregate statistics have been disclosed by EEOC to inform the public of the status of equal employment across industries, regions, occupations, and positions. In recent years, however, more and more firms chose to voluntarily disclose their firm-level reports to the public. In order to understand the motivation for the public disclosure, we want to examine why some firms disclosure EEO1s and others donâ€™t with a randomized control trial with an email intervention. "
