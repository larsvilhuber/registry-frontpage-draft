abstract: "We combine the literature on role models and the gender gap in beliefs about performance to investigate whether, for a role model to affect women's confidence in their performance, it needs to be salient. In order to test our hypothesis, we will recruit participants who will solve a cognitive ability test and answer questions about their performance on the test. Participants are randomly allocated into two conditions. The treatment group will be primed with a role model before the test and the performance-related questions. The control group will first solve the test and answer performance-related questions and be exposed to a role model after.

We investigate the relationship between role models, gender, and confidence by testing the following hypothesis:

(i) Men will be overconfident regarding their test performance
(ii) Women will be underconfident regarding their test performance
(iii) Making a role model salient will lead women to increase their level of confidence about their test performance"
