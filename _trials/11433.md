abstract: "We study gender differences in collaborative networks in a lab experiment. Participants can form links with others and then engage in a joint project with their network neighbours. While there is some prior research on gender differences in networking, our setting exploits a unique experimental design to study not only the number of links but also the strength of ties and the productivity of each link."
