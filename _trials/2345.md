abstract: "The study explores whether government funding of nonprofit organizations crowds in/out private donations using a large-scale, big data field experiment. We will buy advertisements on Facebook to solicit donations among Facebook users to real food banks in NYC that are either government funded, donation funded, or without funder information. Clusters of Facebook users will be randomly exposed one of the experimental conditions: 1) government-funded, 2) donation-funded, and 3) no funding information. As outcome measure, we will monitor peopleâ€™s intention to donate to the food banks by their actual click-through-rates."
