abstract: "Appearance is potentially important in academic settings: in-person/virtual job-talks for academic hiring are common across many fields; personal websites and videos summarizing research articles are becoming standard; speeches and seminars are a routine part of publicizing papers. Are there definitive norms of appearance in academia, or are they more like unspoken rules and are there differences across disciplines? How does the public’s understanding of norms compare against the views of academics? We plan to answer these questions by surveying three groups of respondents—faculty, university students, and lay adults—about their perception of academic job candidates they know to be hypothetical. In particular, we will ask them to rate pictured headshots on perceived competence, professionalism, and agreeability. This study will generate novel evidence on norms of appearance in academic settings. 

This Pre-Analysis Plan is being filed concurrently with the launch of the lay adult and student sample surveys."
