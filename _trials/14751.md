abstract: "This study examines how expert reviews influence product discovery and observational learning in a professional healthcare setting. While previous research has documented how consumers learn about product quality through expert reviews in consumer goods markets, little is known about whether these learning mechanisms persist in professional settings where reviewers have substantial domain expertise. In markets with a vast array of products, expert reviews can serve as a crucial mechanism for product discovery and quality assessment. We conduct a randomized controlled trial on an online medical platform exclusively for licensed physicians, hosting over 600,000 drug reviews. Focusing on a selected set of widely prescribed medications, we causally identify how exposure to reviews from different types of experts—top reviewers, veteran prescribers, and recognized opinion leaders—affects other physicians' rating behaviors and learning processes about drug quality. By focusing on a setting with medical professionals, this study provides novel insights into the role of expert reviews in professional observational learning and contributes to our understanding of how physicians discover and evaluate pharmaceutical products.
