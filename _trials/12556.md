abstract: "Indiana lags behind national averages in terms of foster child reunification rates and time to permanency, and is currently one of only six states that does not guarantee direct legal representation for any youth in foster care. Legal representation for children in foster care could shorten out-of-home placement duration by reducing unnecessary removals or placement changes, expediting steps that support timely reunification, and providing an adult confidante trained to advocate for and provide legal counsel to foster youth. This study evaluates the impact of legal representation for youth in the child welfare system. We will identify impact by randomly allocating access to legal counsel provided by Child Advocates, an Indiana-based nonprofit organization. Eligible youth will be randomized at the beginning of their child welfare case and outcomes will be measured at 12 and 24 months post-randomization, using administrative data from the stateâ€™s child welfare agency and the department of education. Outcomes of interest include family preservation (when applicable), reunification, time to permanency, stability while in care, probability of placement in residential facility, implications for public finance, academic performance and juvenile justice outcomes."
