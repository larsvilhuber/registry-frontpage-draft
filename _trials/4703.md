abstract: "Harmful and irresponsible use of alcohol is a major risk factor for many diseases and injury conditions and is associated with both short- and long-term social consequences for young people. Peers, family members, authorities, and the alcohol industry influence the drinking culture and can play important roles in changing unhealthy irresponsible drinking behaviors. In this project, we design and evaluate an intervention aimed at changing the drinking culture and reducing irresponsible drinking among university students in Denmark. We conduct a randomized controlled trial at university level inviting students to answering a questionnaire including information on health behaviors before and after the intervention. The intervention has multiple components including information on behavior substitution, problem solving, and using a credible source; components that have shown promising results in previous studies (e.g., Kaner et al., 2017 and Norman et al., 2018)."
