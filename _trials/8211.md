abstract: "Consumers consistently elect to stay with default options, even when these options are dominated by other choices. Several hypotheses for this bias exist including the presence of switching costs, unobservable heterogeneity, rational inattention, and present bias. We randomly assign two treatments to customers of a municipal electric utility in the United States to study default bias in plan choice and consumption patterns conditional on plan choice. The experiment is conducted within the context of a planned change to time-varying electricity prices for all utility customers. Within this context, we randomly assign customers to stay on the current rates or be moved to time-varying rates. In both cases, consumers can opt for the alternative. We also randomly assign customers to opt-out of receiving a “shadow bill” of time-varying rates or the option to opt in to a “shadow bill". We collect data on plan choice, electricity consumption, and survey data on household characteristics and behavioral parameters. Using the planned re-assignment of all customers to the new rate in 2021 we also investigate the dynamics of adjustment to long-run price changes. "
