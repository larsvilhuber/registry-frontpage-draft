abstract: "A major cause of poor early childhood development (ECD) in developing countries is under-investment in psychosocial stimulation by caregivers, which is compounded by high rates of mental health issues among caregivers, such as depression and anxiety. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an integrated intervention of parenting training and caregiver mental health promotion on child development outcomes and caregiver well-being among rural households in China. We will study whether a local-led program can effectively improve ECD and caregiver mental health outcomes among vulnerable communities; and whether an integrated ECD and caregiver mental health intervention can improve the impacts on child and caregiver outcomes."
