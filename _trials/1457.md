abstract: "This paper describes the analysis plan for a randomized controlled trial evaluating Twitter as a medium for financial literacy advice and marketing among second-hand clothes sellers in a market in Nairobi, Kenya. We also assess the effect of sales targets in the same population. In 2014 we randomly selected stallholders to be part of four different treatment groups that either received financial literacy advice through Twitter, financial literacy and marketing advice through Twitter, or two different types of sales targeting approaches. This study aims to identify the impact of these interventions on business practices and overall business performance. This plan outlines our evaluation questions, outcomes of interest, and a proposed econometric approach."
