abstract: "Most public service policies involve formal documentation and registration requirements. Administrative requirements that are often onerous: citizens experience ‘administrative burden’ and public employees perceive ‘red tape.’ Yet many administrative requirements also have intended purposes (e.g., reducing fraud, waste, abuse). We examine the dilemma that administrative requirements impose for the design of public service policy from perspective of democratic governance: What does the public think about administrative requirements involving a trade-off between easing administrative processing and protecting program integrity? We develop hypotheses that we test using data from a pre-registered 2x2 factorial survey experiment among a sample of Danish citizens (n = 2,000)."
