abstract: "Biases are inherent to the selection of development project beneficiaries. Three biases have been identified in the literature: 1) self-selection of individuals into projects, 2) the criteria of the implementation agency and 3) the intermediary/delivering agent bias.
This paper looks at the initial level of social capital in targeted beneficiaries of a development project, as it has been showed that social capital is a key ingredient for the success of development programs. 
We measure, through survey and incentivized lab-in-the-field experiments, ex-ante social capital levels in beneficiaries of a project aiming at the development of loans and savings associations in rural Zimbabwe. 
Our hypothesis is that, due to the combined effects of beneficiariesâ€™ self-selection, targeting criteria and DAs interventions, prior to the start of the project, social capital is already higher in beneficiaries than in non-beneficiaries.   
We discuss how, and to which extent, the three mentioned factors (i.e.: self-selection, implementation agency criteria and DA intervention) can be at the origin of these differences, and provide suggestions for future research in order to better disentangle their effects.
