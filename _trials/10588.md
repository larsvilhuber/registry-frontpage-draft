abstract: "Armed conflicts and wars do not only lead to extraordinary humanitarian suffering but also cause tremendous economic losses. In recent years, the economic literature has set out to investigates trade-offs between investment either in conflict technology or in welfare enhancing production, using the guns-versus-butter model. This model presents a framework where conflicting agents are able to appropriate the endogenously produced welfare of the opponent. As in other conflict models, social losses arise due to investments into conflict technology (e.g. arming). This study aims to experimentally test conditions under which (unarmed) peace can emerge in a guns-versus-butter setting. The design is based on the theoretical framework of Garfinkel & Syropoulos (2021), which introduces interesting extensions to the standard guns-versus-butter setting and allows distinguishing between arming and conflict initiation decisions. Building on this theory, we conduct two treatments to examine whether unequal resource-distributions between conflicting parties influence arming and conflict-initiation decisions. The main objective of this study is to experimentally test conditions under which peace can be sustained and welfare losses be reduced.
Our results will provide important insights to researchers and policy makers into conditions that have to be met in order to avoid conflicts and attain peace.
