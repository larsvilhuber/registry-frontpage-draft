abstract: "India faces profound challenges in reducing infant and maternal mortality rates and addressing malnutrition, particularly in rural and tribal areas. Despite various governmental initiatives like the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), poor health outcomes persist due to multiple factors including inadequate healthcare access, socio-economic deprivation, and lack of awareness. The study intends to enhance the effectiveness of existing health missions by integrating them with community-driven interventions.

We designed a randomized field experiment that leverages women’s SHG networks to promote adherence to health and nutritional protocols among pregnant and lactating women. By engaging in group-to-peer counselling (facilitated by members of self-help group (SHG)), the expecting and lactating mothers receive crucial information about healthcare services, nutrition, and WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene). We aim to reduce information asymmetry that are generally linked with: (a) social norms, and (b) lack of awareness. Reduction in information asymmetry among community health workers and women will result in greater healthcare uptake (the demand side) and timely intervention by local health workers (the supply side). As part of the experiment, a cadre of local community agents referred to as “Setu Didi” was recruited and deployed in the treatment areas . They are trained to disseminate health, nutrition, and WASH information among pregnant or lactating women SHG members, or any member in their households. Thus, the Setu Didi acts as communication/coordination channel among the key actors of the intervention: SHG groups, institutional local health workers (ASHA workers and Anganwadi workers), and target women. The intervention integrates the efforts of the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) to combat the dual challenges of healthcare access and nutritional deficiency.
