abstract: "We study how mechanisms that seek to make an optimal use of limited government capacity perform in realistic settings, in which participants need not play according to equilibrium.  Our motivating example is that of a tax authority with only limited capacity to perform audits ahead of collection.

The experiment will offer players the opportunity to settle a debt that they owe to a collection authority. The treatments of the experiment will vary the method of collection, settlement offers and information provided to participants about the settlement decisions of others."
