abstract: "Using Public Good Game to examine contribution levels in teamwork, I assess whether in a context of no-anonymity, having heterogeneity in marginal per-capita return (MPCR) and/or knowing the MPCR of other team members can affect the average contribution level. I hypothesize that when participants in a team have different MPCR and can observe the MPCR of the other team members, contributions will increase. The “revealed incentives” in teamwork, represented by the MPCR, act as a noisy predictor of the private contributions and drive up the contributions as participants have “image motivation”."
