abstract: "Internal constrains are receiving increasing attention in development economics, since they can help understand poverty dynamics. Focusing on these constraints, our study evaluates the impacts of an aspirational hope intervention among Bolivian milk producers. The intervention consists of showing farmers a video of local role models, followed by a series of workshops on aspirational hope, referred to as ‘hope curriculum’. We hypothesize that our intervention can reduce aspirational failure and assuage learned hopelessness, improving aspirations and consequently productivity. Our setting is uniquely placed to bridge the gap between aspirations and productivity, and study changes in the latter. Contrary to previous work on aspirations, our sample is relatively homogeneous and comprised entirely of smallholder dairy farmers—facilitating the measurement and comparison of productivity. We work with 549 milk producers organized in 52 milk delivery points. We stratify our sample by municipality and number of farmers in delivery points. Then, we randomly assign half of the delivery points to either treatment or control groups."
