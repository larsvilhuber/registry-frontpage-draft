abstract: "This study is an impact evaluation of the introduction of a nutrient-rich crop to women smallholder farmers in Uganda. The orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) crop is biofortified with Vitamin-A and therefore expected to improve the nutritional outcomes of women and children in targeted households. The study employs a clustered randomized control trial (RCT) design covering a large sample of 8,400 households across 210 villages to test the relative efficacy of various interventions to relax adoption constraints of the OFSP crop to women farmers. A series of bundled and standalone treatment conditions address the following hypothesized constraints to adoption: resource, information, credit, time inconsistency, and price risk. "
