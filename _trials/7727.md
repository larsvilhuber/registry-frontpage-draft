abstract: "Export-led growth is the dominant contemporary developmental paradigm. Export Promotion agencies and international donors operate programs around the world to help firms enter global value chains and access foreign markets. Compliance with quality criteria is one key mechanism that is assumed to condition firms’ success in this endeavour. We collaborate with the Tunisian Ministry of Industry and the German Metrology Institute (PTB) to test how to stimulate small and medium sized enterprises’ (SME) use of quality assurance services for exporting. For this purpose, we develop a program “Appui Qualité Export” to mitigate three barriers of SMEs under-consumption of quality assurance service: SMEs lack information, SMEs lack competences to identify their needs for export quality assurance and SMEs lack financial means/underestimate the value of investing in quality assurance. The effect of these interventions on firms’ perception, knowledge and actual consumption of quality assurance services as well as on their performances in terms of productivity, innovation and exports shall be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial between the beginning of 2020 and 2022."
