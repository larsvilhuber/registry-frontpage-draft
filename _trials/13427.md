abstract: "I first construct a theoretical model to explain and predict the outcome. The intuition behind the model is simple: underestimating the automation risk will force you to revise your beliefs, leading to a lower probability of entering a specific occupation.
I focus on three occupations: Teachers, nurses, office clerks, and economists. It is important to understand the determinants for labor supply in these occupations and focus on automation risk since nobody has provided causal evidence that automation risk is a determinant for labor supply in these occupations. To investigate my research question, I leverage an online experiment and pay respondents from Prolific to participate in my study. Respondents answer a survey with questions related to the topic, such as the attractiveness, and probability of entering a specific occupation, job preferences, and background questions. The experiment consists of one treatment group and one control group. The treatment consists of the automation risk calculated by Willrobotstakemyjob.com. A gender and race perspective are added. I also perform an additional analysis including political preferences, social status belief about salary."
