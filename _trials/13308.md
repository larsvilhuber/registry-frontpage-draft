abstract: "This research aims to study behavioral attenuation: the idea that, as a result of noisy information processing, people’s decisions are generally insufficiently elastic to variation in economic primitives.   To do this, we run 30 parallel treatments, covering a broad range of economic decisions ranging from preference elicitations to belief updating to generic optimization problems, involving risk, time, consumption-savings, effort supply, taxes, fairness, giving, energy savings, information disclosure, prediction and inference, in both individual decisions and strategic games.     In each of these domains (treatments), we vary one parameter, within-subject over a series of rounds, that has a predicted monotonic relationship to the subject’s decision.   After each decision we elicit the subject’s “cognitive uncertainty” (CU) – the likelihood with which the subject believes they failed to make an optimal decision.    Our main hypothesis is that (i) subjects with higher CU will make decisions that are less responsive to the parameter varied in the experiment and (ii) in tasks with objectively correct decisions, subjects will be less responsive than optimal.  Our subjects are recruited from Prolific, restricting to subjects from the US and UK. "
