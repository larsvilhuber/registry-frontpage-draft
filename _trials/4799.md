abstract: "While temporal discounting contributes to inaction in tackling the eventual consequences of climate change, the implications of these consequences are inherently different for parents whose utility maximization are likely to include that of their child’s as well. In this study, we examine whether orienting a parent’s perspective toward the future of their child results in different environmental choices. We leverage a large environment education program being administered in 136 schools across 10 states in India to conduct a cluster randomized trial that looks at the impact of sending parents information about the implications of climate change on household behavior. The information will be provided in pamphlet form and asks parents to take simple actions around the household to help save water and reduce waste and their carbon footprint. In one treatment arm, we send general information, while in a second treatment arm, the wording of the pamphlet is modified to reference the child’s future. In a third control arm, parents receive no information. We also randomize treatment across an additional 110 middle schools that are not receiving the environment education program. "
