abstract: "We set up a controlled marketing campaign within the mobile app of a European bank. In particular, we nudge treated users to create and use separate sub-accounts to explicitly implement mental accounting in their personal finances: The banks' clients are recommended to create separate banking accounts for their day to day finances, i.e. for things that they "need" to buy and things that they "want" to buy, for their buffer savings, and for their short- and medium-term goals (e.g., a new laptop or a new car). We subsequently measure the effect of using sub-accounts, i.e. adopting mental accounting, on the clients' financial behaviour. This includes changes in income, spending, and saving. We further conduct a survey to measure whether the application of mental accounting has increased the client's subjective financial health."
