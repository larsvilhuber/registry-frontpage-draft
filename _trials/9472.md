abstract: "Subjects in our online experiment are randomly assigned to groups of three. All group members observe the same outcome of a lottery, which can be HIGH or LOW. The group receives the winning price if and only if the group member in charge reports HIGH. Our experiment has three treatments. (i) In treatment SINGLE, each of the three group members is asked to report the outcome. Each of their reports is then chosen with the same probability of one third to determine the payoff. (ii) In treatment DELEGATION, one subject is randomly chosen to be the first mover (FM). The FM can report HIGH or LOW, but can also delegate the report to a second mover (SM), who is also randomly chosen. This SM needs to decide between HIGH and LOW. SMs are asked for their report under the assumption that they can actually make a report (i.e. that the FM delegates). (iii) In treatment MULTISTAGE DELEGATION, the SM can delegate as well. If so, the third mover (TM) is asked for the final report. 

Our main research question is how the frequency of lying differs between males and females. We will consider this question across treatments for two settings, with and without delegation opportunity. Previous literature found gender differences in lying behavior when no delegation is possible. We therefore predict that more males than females will lie in this setting as well. We are not aware of previous research regarding gender differences in lying behavior with the possibility to delegate. We therefore have no hypothesis whether the gender difference will be more, less, or equally pronounced with or without delegation.
We consider the differences between treatments in another research project (AEA RCT "The impact of delegation on the frequency of lying: Theory and experimental evidence")
