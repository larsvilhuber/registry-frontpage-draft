abstract: "Savings implies the cost of scarifying present consumption but benefits in the future. If individuals are time consistent, we expect saving levels to be optimum but under present-biased individuals, we observe undersaving since they overweigh present over the future. Evidence shows that individuals are at least partially naive about this present-bias and fail to predict their future behavior (DellaVigna and Malmendier, 2016 and Acland and Levy, 2015). This is one of the explanatory factors for which individuals often do not take a beneficial action such as saving.
Literature shows that small reminder interventions have an economically significant impact of behavior in a variety of domains including savings, loan repayments or medication adherence (Karlan et al., 2017). When individuals face future plans, as in the case of savings, memory is important since they may forget about the task. 
We design an intervention that consists of randomly send weekly SMS reminders to low income individuals who have a bank account. Under this assumption, SMS reminders might help in increasing savings (or in generating regular-saving behavior). Our aim is to analyze whether individuals save more and more regularly when they receive remainders.  In addition, we aim to confirm whether the use of alternative access channels, such as banking agents, to interact with the formal financial system is a preferred option beside branches or ATMs.
