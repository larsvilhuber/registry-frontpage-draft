abstract: "This project investigates the effect of changing legal penalties, and citizens' beliefs about these penalties, on corruption. We focus on a single, clear case: the law against riding a motorcycle without a helmet in India, a setting where many citizens pay bribes instead of a formal ticket, and are unsure of the true legal fine. We randomly inform motorcyclists of the true legal penalty using private information campaigns. The intervention spans a major policy change, during which the fine for riding without a helmet will increase by 500%, allowing us to capture time series variation in how bribes respond to legal changes. Our results, both on the process of bribery as well as on the degree of law-breaking and police enforcement seek to provide new insights into the underlying mechanism of corruption, as well as direct policy implications for reducing graft.
