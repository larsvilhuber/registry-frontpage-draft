abstract: "Abstract: Andre et al (2022, ReSTUD) demonstrated significant heterogeneity in how households think the economy (i.e., inflation and unemployment ) respond to various economic shocks. An implication is that heterogenous mental models are a meaningful source of cross-sectional heterogeneity in macroeconomic expectations. We build upon this work by using a large-scale, online experiment to document heterogeneity in the subjective mental models households use to anticipate the central bank’s policy decisions (i.e. the reaction function) and how those policy decisions transmit to the economy (i.e. the transmission function). We then test the ability of various types of central bank communication to coordinate each of these three types of subjective mental models on the true data generating process underlying the economy, on the central bank’s true reaction function, and on the true underlying transmission function."
