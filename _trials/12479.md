abstract: "As recent waves of technological change have considerably altered the demand for skills in the labor market, many scholars, policy makers, and practitioners emphasize the growing importance of on-the-job training. However, the training participation of individual workers hardly increased throughout the recent decade, and training rates are extremely heterogenous across workers and firms. Particularly, workers who commonly have high returns to training, such as low educated workers and workers in small firms, train on average less than high educated workers in larger firms. 
A main reason might be that the heterogeneity in expected training costs and benefits might explain the heterogeneity in the training participation of individuals. Particularly, certain workers such as, for example, low educated and older workers who do not train might overestimate their costs or underestimate their benefits from training.
However, although expected training costs and benefits may have a stronger influence workers’ decision to participate in training than their realized training costs and benefits, virtually no study has explored workers’ expectations of the costs and benefits of training. 
In this study, we analyze the causal effect of expected training costs and benefits on workers’ training activities. Therefore, we, first, elicit workers’ willingness to train and their expected training costs and benefits in a high frequency panel survey. Second, we implement two information treatments to shift workers’ expectations about their training cost and benefits. 
We use this experimental data to study impact of expected training costs and benefits on their willingness to train and their actual training participation. We then link this survey data to detailed register data that allow us to follow the labor market careers of workers in the long run. "
