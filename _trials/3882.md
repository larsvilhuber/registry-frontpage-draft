abstract: "The 8-month Unlocking Talent (UT) study tests the efficacy of onebillion’s onecourse literacy and numeracy applications in the Chichewa language, delivered on iPads to Standard 2 (grade 2) children during the 2019-20 school year in Malawi. The study represents an efficacy RCT using a non-clustered, blocked individual random assignment design. Two government primary schools were purposively selected for the study: one urban and one peri-urban school located in the Central Region. Conditions in the two communities and schools are challenging. Families in both communities are very low income and face food security issues and other poverty-related challenges. Neither school has electricity and class sizes at both schools are very large (up to 100 children). All eligible Standard 2 learners ages 6-10 were randomly assigned independently within the two schools to treatment and control groups. The treatment groups are using either the literacy or numeracy curriculum—not both—for 40 minutes per day during the regular school day. Children in the treatment groups step out of different standard classes on different days of the week to attend the learning center, where the program is delivered. Thus, the intervention represents a supplement to normal instruction in the tablet subject. The control group students continue with standard instruction only. The study uses an experimental design to ensure that differences in learning gains between the treatment and control groups can be attributed to the tablet intervention rather than to pre-existing differences among the groups. The experimental design ensures a high level of internal validity that provides rigorous estimates of the impacts at the two schools included in the study. However, due to the purposive selection of the schools, impact estimates may not generalize to all Malawi government primary schools."
