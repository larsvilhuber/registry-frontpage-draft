abstract: "This paper studies the effects of introducing flexible work arrangements on female labor force participation and gender norms. In a field experiment with 1,670 households, we test the impact of offering flexible jobs to women currently outside of the labor force. We find three sets of results. First, flexible work-from-home jobs are highly effective at bringing out-of-labor-force women into paid work. Job flexibility more than triples take up from 15% for an office job to 48% for a job that women can do from home while multitasking with childcare. Second, these flexible work-from-home jobs can also act as a stepping stone to less flexible work. The opportunity to try paid work from home increases women's take up of office-based jobs two to three months later. This opportunity to have a "gateway job" may be especially important for women from traditional households: job flexibility is more important to the labor supply of more traditional women, and work experience in turn shifts the gender attitudes of these women to become less traditional. Third, work-from-home comes with tradeoffs. It selects for less productive workers and causes workers to complete tasks more slowly and less accurately. However, these drawbacks are outweighed by the large positive extensive margin labor supply response to work-from-home. Thus, flexible work arrangements can both attract women to the labor force and provide a gateway to outside-the-home jobs."
