abstract: "In this project, partnering with the Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) and the Government of Tamil Nadu, we will test whether advanced online coursework and tutoring can identify and support high achievers who lack access to resources. Using administrative data and a screening mechanism, we will provide direct evidence of the distribution of high-potential students in Tamil Nadu. In an RCT with high-achieving students, we will test the effects of offering an advanced pre-algebra class and the additive benefits of support systems, such as tutoring. We aim to provide a model that can be extended to other Indian states or other countries if it proves successful. "
