abstract: "
Public programs in developing countries, even when proven successful at smaller scales, tend to suffer from implementation challenges when scaled up and may not deliver the intended benefits. For instance, low accountability of public officials like teachers leads to high absenteeism; thus, teacher training programs that may be effective when delivered with intense monitoring for a small number of schools, cannot be implemented at a larger scale if teachers are frequently out-of-school. This project evaluates a large, government-led scale-up of an effective pedagogical technique, targeted instruction, to increase learning among primary school students in Ghana. Additionally, this project investigates how existing government mid-level managers can be leveraged to facilitate the take-up and delivery of the program and enhance effectiveness of government scale-up efforts. 

 We use a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of the targeted instruction (TI) program at scale, and the incremental impact of combining it with the management training program. The targeted instruction intervention provides training and materials to treatment schools for teaching students in grades 4 through 6 by their learning levels instead of their grade level. The management training program offers additional training to school managers on managerial best practices.  Our trial answers the following questions: how effective and cost effective is a large-scale targeted instruction program? Can a government-led management training improve managerial practices and enhance the take-up and impact of this program? The study will be conducted across 210 schools in 20 districts of Ghana. "
