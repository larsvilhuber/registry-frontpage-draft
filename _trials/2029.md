abstract: "The gender wage gap is still a real and not fully understood phenomenon. Recently, there has been a shift from more classical explanations to more behavioral explanations.

Following this line, it has been argued that gender differences in the propensity to negotiate and in the actual behavior when negotiating can explain a sizable part of the observed gender wage gap. For example, Card et al. (2016) found that 8% of the existing gender wage gap in Portugal could be explained by men and women behaving differently on these aspects.

One underexplored issue is that of gender interaction effects under asymmetric bargaining situations with one bargaining party being in a stronger position than the other. For example, Hernandez-Arenaz and Iriberri (2017) used data from a TV show with large stakes to study gender differences and gender interaction effects in an alternating-offer bargaining settings between two asymmetric parties. They found that the only matching that shows to be different is that between male proposers (in a strong position) and female responders (in a weak position): in this matching responders demand less yielding bargaining outcomes that are more favourable for proposers. Similar results have been found by Ditrich et al. (2014) and Andersen et al. (2014). 

We propose a laboratory experiment to explore gender differences and gender interaction effects in asymmetric bargaining situations.  The main design consists of a lab experiment with 4 different treatments which vary the degree and source of the bargaining asymmetry in order to identify gender differences and gender interaction effects when bargaining in a clean randomized lab experiment."
