abstract: "Can equalizing market opportunities for men and women contribute to closing the gender gap in autonomy? We randomize participation in and participant gender for WFP cash-for-work programs that target poor households in 6 countries. We leverage this variation to estimate the impacts of women's participation in the program, adjusting for household impacts of program participation, on women's autonomy."
