abstract: "This paper presents experimental evidence on the impact of a simple information intervention on the health knowledge and behaviour of microfinance borrowers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan. A random sample of borrowers from the largest microfinance institution in Pakistan were individually randomised into various treatments arms. All received an SMS with the same COVID-19 health advice from the World Health Organisation. The SMS documents the 3 main symptoms of COVID-19 and 5 mitigation steps to reduce the spread of the virus. In the main treatment, clients received the information primed with a religious introduction. Additional treatments explore other mediums to disseminate information, such as local and international organisations, and local and national government. "
