abstract: "In Sub-Saharan Africa, approximately one quarter of married women of reproductive age do not use contraception despite stating, in representative surveys, that they do not want to have any (more) children or that they want to wait at least two years. In prior work, we show that women sampled in Southern Mozambique and five different states across Nigeria often believe that their chance of getting pregnant in the next year is much lower than the reference pregnancy risk used by the World Health Organization. In addition, we find that this perceived risk of pregnancy when not using contraception is strongly correlated with contraceptive use. In this experiment, we test whether providing women with information about this reference pregnancy risk changes their perceived risk of pregnancy and use of contraception. Two information interventions are delivered through: (1) a video message from a medical doctor from the same region as the participant, (2) a sticker replicating an infographic message used in the video and (3) scripted messages delivered by the enumerator as part of a face-to-face interview. The sticker is stuck on a small gift which is expected to be consumed within one month of receipt. The control group sees a placebo video which forms part of the treatment video and receives the same small gift covered with a blank sticker instead. An endline survey is expected to take place 12-14 months later.
