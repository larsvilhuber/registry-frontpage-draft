abstract: "We plan to run three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to help increase enrollment in a cover crop cost share program for soybean and corn farmers in the Midwest. In the first two tests, we will distribute informative mailers to eligible farmers, which will be sent from a large agricultural cooperative, which is a familiar and trusted source of information for its member farmers. We will test the impact of a behaviorally-informed mailer (letter in one test, postcard in another) on enrollment in the cost-share program, and will also test whether offering a lottery incentive impacts enrollment timing. In the third test, we will investigate whether a farmer-to-farmer referral email campaign impacts enrollment in the cover crop cost-share program. "
