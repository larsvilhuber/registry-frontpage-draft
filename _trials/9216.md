abstract: "We document the extent to which mobility varies by gender with the introduction of an improved private transport option. To this end, we will conduct a field experiment to evaluate the causal impact of introducing free and efficient transport on mobility, access to services and desired destinations, and measures of empowerment and well-being. Our key research aims are to: 1) examine gender differences in mobility patterns, travel demand, and transport preferences in urban settings; and 2) identify how the removal of key barriers to efficient and safe transport affects: a) travel demand and mobility; b) travel patterns and preferences; and c) autonomy and well-being, particularly for women.
