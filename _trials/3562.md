abstract: "Although bargaining over the prices of goods and services is an integral part of life for the world's poor, little work has been done to extend bargaining models to a developing country context. A key feature of this understudied context is the prevalence of, and variation in, financial need (or the initial endowment) of bargainers, a feature currently ignored in previous bargaining theory and evidence. This study will use theory, panel data, real price bargaining exercises, and a lab-in-the-field experiment on a sample of garment-making firm-owners in Ghana to explore the relationship between a bargainer's initial endowment and their final allocation of surplus.
