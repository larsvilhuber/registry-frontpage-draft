abstract: "This project uses a randomized control trial to evaluate the impact of telehealth clinic facilities on health and bargaining power of female microfinance borrowers. The project will exploit the variation in timing of introducing this health service to determine the causal impact of the program on our outcome indicators. Our sample comprises of the entire client population from two MFI branches; a treatment branch and a control branch. The overall working sample consists of 2982 clients; 1,356 from the treated branch and 1626 from the control branch. We hope that findings from this study will provide insights on whether technology can be effectively leveraged to improve provision of health services, especially in areas which are marked by low access to health-care."
