abstract: "Mobility and credit constraints faced by women in developing countries often lead them to operate their businesses from their homes and local neighborhoods. Having no public storefronts, women running local businesses might be limited in their ability to reach customers besides their friends, family, and neighbors. Given increasing access to smartphones and the Internet, this study explores whether digital market access, or going online, can provide inclusive and productive opportunities to female entrepreneurs. Particularly, I randomize access to social media marketing support and training among female microfinance clients in Jordan. The intervention aims at helping women expand their businessesâ€™ online presence on Facebook, one of the most accessible platforms in Jordan and much of the developing world. Outcomes of interest include program completion, Facebook page usage and practices, business formalization and performance, liquidity, and behavioral changes among female entrepreneurs. "
