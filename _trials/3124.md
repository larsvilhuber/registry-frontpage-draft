abstract: "This project is a replication of our prior work examining the role of heterogeneity in loss aversion for identifying models of expectations-based reference dependence (KoÌ‹szegi and Rabin, 2006, 2007) (KR). In a previous study, we demonstrated that different levels of loss aversion lead to different signs for comparative statics previously used to test the KR model, and in an experiment with 607 subjects, we showed heterogeneous treatment effects over loss aversion types. Here, we describe our plan to replicate this experiment, providing power calculations for our desired sample size of 400 subjects and detailing the tables we will fill out once we run our experiments."
