abstract: "While indoor air pollution is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, its sources and impacts are largely misunderstood by the public. In a randomized controlled trial including 281 households in France, we test two interventions aimed at raising households' awareness of indoor pollutants and ultimately improving indoor air quality. While both generic and personalized information increase awareness, only personalised information is successful in shifting behavior and decreasing indoor air pollution - by 20% compared to the control group. Heterogeneous treatment effects show that this effect is concentrated in the most polluted households at baseline."
