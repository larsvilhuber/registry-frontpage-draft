abstract: "There has been a significant rise in remote work in the United States. Yet, important questions remain about the consequences of remote work for workers’ labor market outcomes. With this study, we aim to address two primary questions. First, what is the effect of indicating a preference for remote work in a job application on an applicant’s likelihood of being called back for the job? Second, does the effect of remote work on callbacks differ by the gender of the applicant?"
