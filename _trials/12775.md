abstract: "We study the gender gap in willingness to contribute ideas and a potential fix to its corresponding welfare losses. Past studies have shown that people are less confident in topics that are stereotypically incompatible with their gender and hence report less willingness to contribute their answers in group decision-making tasks. This leads to a degraded group performance due to valuable ideas not being elicited. In a lab experiment, we introduce an intervention that prioritizes the answer given by a specific gender while allowing agents to actively opt out of such prioritization. We hypothesize that this soft lean-in intervention encourages high-ability men and women to contribute more in stereotypically incompatible domains and improves group performance."
