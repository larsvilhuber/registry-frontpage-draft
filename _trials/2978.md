abstract: "Sustainability advocates often state that it is important for individuals to vote with their dollars, meaning that they should purchase products that reflect their beliefs and values. However, we know from moral balancing theory that sometimes one pro-social behavior can crowd out the motivation to engage in a subsequent behavior. If this is true also for political expression, can voting with oneâ€™s dollar cause decreases in other types of political expression? This study is the first stage of a set of experiments that seek to determine whether voting with your dollar and other forms of political expression are substitutes, complements, or unrelated. Through randomization of question ordering in an online survey, we examine whether answering questions about political consumerism behaviors affects a person's stated likelihood of engaging in a set of political behaviors ranging from voting to contacting an elected representative."
