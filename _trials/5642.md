abstract: "In sub-Saharan Africa, smallholder agriculture transformation is constrained by multifaceted risks that transcend humans, livestock, and crops. Malaria is one of the top diseases with a high economic burden to farmers and governments. Invasive pests such as fall armyworm and stem borer reduce crop production and increase the cost of production considerably. Furthermore, shortage and/or unavailability of quality fodder hinder livestock production and draught power performance of animals. While uptake of available technologies remains a key challenge to policymakers and researchers, interventions addressing these challenges are often done in a piecemeal fashion. In this impact evaluation, we aim to study the role of social networks, incentives, and nudges in the diffusion of technologies that simultaneously reduce the burden of malaria and low productivity of crops and livestock. We use incentivized and nudged social networks to deliver extension information on the adoption of push-pull technology (PPT) for pest control and quality fodder production, and house screening (HS) for malaria control. The social networks we are studying are one-to-five groups, which are massively being institutionalized in the local government structure of Ethiopia. As an extension approach, the one–to–five groups can help disseminating information about new technologies and best practices. Even though the one–to–five group extension approach seems promising to transform the agriculture sector through the diffusion of new technologies and best practices, many accuse the government that it uses the one–to–five groups to control public life and mobilize support to the ruling party with little impact on technology diffusion. Evaluating the effectiveness of this unique social network informs policymakers to tailor policies towards extension approaches that deliver trusted information, which can enhance the adoption of new technologies. The findings also provide lessons to the rest of sub-Saharan Africa where the extension systems follow a top-down approach of reaching farmers rather than being participatory. Our study fits to the emerging literature on the role of incentives and nudges on various development outcomes in low-income countries."
