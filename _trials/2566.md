abstract: "The purpose of this research is to test whether the presence of a canine at a well-known donation site elicits increased charitable donors and donation amounts. A potential mechanism for such an increase is that when eye contact is made with a dog, a powerful hormone, Oxytocin, is released. Existing studies have documented that higher levels of oxytocin increase charitable donations. We will build on a long strand of charitable giving literature in economics to test whether the reduced-form effects of canine presence on human charity."
