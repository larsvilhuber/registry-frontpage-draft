abstract: "There are large performance gaps in standardized test scores based on gender, migration background, and socioeconomic status. However, these gaps are the result of an interplay of individual choices and institutional inequality. Therefore, it is unclear if the public sees these performance gaps as a problem, and if there is a need to implement policies to compensate for differences. To investigate these questions, I conduct an information provision experiment using a representative sample of Germans (N~4,000). In the experiment, I provide participants with information regarding performance gaps in education. I then assess if survey participants perceive performance gaps as problematic and their views on appropriate measures to address these disparities. The findings potentially have implications for educational policies and interventions aimed at reducing inequalities and promoting equal opportunities in the German education system."
