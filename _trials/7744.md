abstract: "In Sub-Saharan Africa, high levels of youth unemployment and weak agricultural input supply chains have been widely documented. However, relatively few studies have tested the effectiveness of employment programs for rural youth. At the same time, adoption rates of improved agricultural technologies among smallholder farmers remain low due to supply chain complications. Our study seeks to provide insight on both fronts. We will also contribute to the understanding of psychometric measures and better business practices on the entrepreneurial success of rural youth. We accomplish this by conducting a randomized control trial where rural youth in Eastern Kenya were trained in business concepts and linked with agricultural input suppliers to become resellers of agricultural inputs to smallholder farmers."
