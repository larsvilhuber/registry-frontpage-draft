abstract: "This paper presents the pre-analysis plan of two randomized interventions aimed at evaluating the causal impact of health insurance on engagement in higher-health-risk higher-return activities, and poverty. In one treatment group, we offer free health insurance to small-scale farmers in Kenya. In another group, without any subsidies, we present information about the product to existing social networks, which contain early adopters who have experienced the product before. Our primary hypothesis is that health insurance will engage people in higher-health-risk higher-return activities. Our secondary hypothesis is that the second intervention increases trust in the product, and thus take-up and risk-taking behavior despite the absence of any subsidies."
