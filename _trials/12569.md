abstract: "Transitioning to green technologies can be daunting, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). SMEs face several barriers to reducing their energy consumption and carbon emissions: limited access to information and support; a lack of knowledge and expertise; complex regulations; and financial constraints. This project proposes to assess and quantify these individual deterrents and enablers of SMEs' energy efficiency, not in isolation but as part of an integrated framework. To do so, we will conduct a randomized field experiment on a representative sample of Portuguese SMEs. We will investigate whether better information provision, hands-on training, consultancy, and improved access to credit can improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. We expect these interventions (individually or together) to increase firmsâ€™ interest in greener technologies and shift their investment behavior toward such technologies."
