abstract: "DDU-GKY is a large-scale training programme in India. It is targeted at the rural poor youth, and combines short-term training with guaranteed job placement and faces two problems. Its promoters believe that enrolment is too low and struggle to convince millions of rural young poor workers to join the government-sponsored training-cum placement programme. At the same time, a large share of those who join drop out during the training programme and the initial months of job placement. We survey potential candidates after they have been briefed about the programme and measure their expectations about the location and the salary of the jobs offered post-training. We then randomly provide information on the actual distribution of job locations, salaries or both and estimate its effect on candidates expectations and willingness to join the programme. This design allows us to evaluate experimentally how misinformation distorts joining decisions and how it affects the targeting of the program. It will also provide estimates of how much potential candidates value the location of the jobs offered and how this value differs across socioeconomic groups."
