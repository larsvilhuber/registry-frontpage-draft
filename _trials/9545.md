abstract: "We propose a large-scale evaluation of a learning platform designed in 2002 by AutoMind, a multidisciplinary team where the leadership is now at the University of Chile. The evaluation design will allow us to test the effect of Conecta Ideas vis-a-vis a control group. Moreover, the experimental design will feature three treatment groups (in addition to the control group). First, a group where students will earn purely symbolic incentives at the individual level. These incentives will be given for using the platform and for getting correct answers to exercises. Second, a group where these symbolic incentives translate to tangible prizes (e.g., books) for students. Third, a group where prizes are given as a function of the performance of the classroom. In addition to testing the effect of Conecta Ideas, this experimental design will allow us to test: a) individual vs group incentives, and b) tangible, but non-monetary incentives vs. purely symbolic incentives."
