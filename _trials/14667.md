abstract: "This paper investigates time inconsistencies in food consumption based on a framed field experiment at a college canteen where participants repeatedly select and consume lunch menus. To test dynamically inconsistent behavior, the design features a continuous convex non-monetary budget in an entirely natural environment and satisfies the consume-on-receipt assumption. Leveraging 3,666 choices of different food healthiness, we find no time inconsistency at the aggregate meal level. Utility weight estimates at the dish level reveal that consumersâ€˜ time inconsistencies are hidden by balancing behavior between food categories, like main dishes and desserts. Individuals who exert self-control in food consumption take up a commitment device as soon as it becomes available, while non-committers tend to be present-biased. Our results suggest that internal and external control strategies are substitutes. When measuring present bias with standard monetary tasks, we find no correlation between dynamic inconsistency in food and money choices.
