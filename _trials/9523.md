Basic setup: Participants in the role of Choice Architects (CA) can restrict the decision set of other participants who are in the role of decision makers (DM). In particular, CAs decide whether to grant full decision autonomy to the DM (i.e., leave all possible choice options available) or to restrict the DMs’ choice set by banning one or more of the available options. Decision Makers (DM) face two types of decisions: an intertemporal and a donation decision. In the intertemporal decision, DMs can choose among several options about the distribution of money that is received either today or in the future. In the donation decision, DMs can choose among several options about the distribution of money between themselves and a charity.  CAs make intervention decisions for both types of the DAs' decision types.
