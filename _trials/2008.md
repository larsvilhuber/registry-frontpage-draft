abstract: "	This evaluation is of the STRYDE 2.0 program implemented by TechnoServe in Mbeya, Tanzania, which seeks to promote youth self-employment and microbusinesses through a 12 month course. Youth (aged 18-30) who participate receive 3 months of in classroom training followed by 9 months of aftercare activities. The goal of this intervention is to train rural youth on personal efficacy and career skills and later link the trained youth with potential employers or help them develop business plans for self-employment. STRYDE 2.0 is delivered through two different arms: direct and indirect. Participants in the direct arm receive training directly from STRYDE 2.0 employees. In the indirect arm participants receive training on the same STRYDE 2.0 modules, but their instruction is received through partner organizations, typically vocational schools where they are already enrolled. 
     This study will evaluate the impact of the direct and indirect arms. The direct arm will primarily be evaluated quantitatively through a randomized control trial. The study will utilize a cluster randomization method to select villages for treatment and control, and the sample size will be approximately 144 areas. In each area, 20-30 youth will be surveyed before and after the administration of the survey. In addition to this quantitative evaluation, there will be a qualitative evaluation of the direct arm. This will be composed of focus group discussions with participants, and classroom observations throughout the treatment.
     This proposed study will seek to qualitatively describe the impact of the STRYDE 2.0 program on the indirect participantsâ€™ socio-economic statuses, entrepreneurial knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, employment, and psycho-social adjustment. Differential impacts will also be studied, such as those between male and female participants. All results will be qualitative, providing an understanding of the mechanisms behind the impacts observed, which will allow TechnoServe to scale the STRYDE indirect program in the future. Further, this qualitative work will inform the development of a quantitative arm of the study. 
	Through this evaluation two important knowledge gaps will be addressed in the study of what strategies can effectively reduce high rates of unemployment, particularly among youth. First it will contribute to the understanding of whether skills that promote successful employment and entrepreneurship can be taught through training programs. The current evidence on this issue is scarce and shows mixed results, leaving policy makers unsure of whether investing in these program is an effective strategy to reduce unemployment. Second, this study will explore the question of how variation in implementation modalities influence the outcomes of development programs. This is of particular importance as governments and development organizations explore ways to make interventions more cost-effective and sustainable without compromising on the quality of the programming and, consequently, reducing the effects.
