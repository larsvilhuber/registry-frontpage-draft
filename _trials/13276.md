abstract: "This project examines an environment where a group of two senders (group-members) communicates with a receiver (evaluator) by disclosing or not disclosing a realized outcome. Group members have distinct preferences over the group's disclosure decision, and their disclosure recommendations get aggregated into a disclosure decision according to a deliberation protocol. We characterize, both theoretically and experimentally, the relation between a group's deliberation protocol and two observable outcomes: individual disclosure recommendations, and the evaluator's interpretation of the absence of disclosure. Generally, the evaluator interprets ``no news'' with skepticism, but each of the group-members is more or less targeted by that skepticism depending on how the group deliberates. "
