abstract: "We embed a randomized controlled trial during an online survey of medical students in China. The survey collects studentsâ€™ family backgrounds, academic performances, as well as their career goals. Information regarding variant aspects of the medical profession is provided at random in the middle of the survey. We aim to evaluate how these informational interventions affect students' stated willingness to become a doctor after graduation. "
