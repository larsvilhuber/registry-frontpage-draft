abstract: "While commitment demand has been documented in various settings, recent evidence suggests that some of it might be due to mistakes. We propose to investigate the robustness of commitment demand in a field study involving meal choices on a food ordering platform. We elicit participants’ preferences over the range of meals presented on the platform. Preferences are elicited twice using three methods: ranking, monetary valuations, and binary choices. We propose to compare the consistency of expressed preferences across methods and the stability within a method, as well as to explore drivers of the variability observed. We will benchmark our results against expert forecasts and provide guidance on method selection."
