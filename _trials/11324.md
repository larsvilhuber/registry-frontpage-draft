abstract: "School attendance and learning in lower-income countries are hampered by both demand and supply constraints. On the demand side, health and nutrition may affect attendance, potentially compounded by competing demands on a childâ€™s time. On the supply side, low levels of teacher attendance may affect schooling decisions and learning. We cross-randomize teacher incentives with the randomized expansion of the national school feeding program to study the impacts of relaxing demand and supply constraints individually and jointly. We also exploit seasonal variation to further shed light on demand-side mechanisms and provide novel evidence on the role of school feeding programs as a social safety net for protecting children against shocks and stressors."
