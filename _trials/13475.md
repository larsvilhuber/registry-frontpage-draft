abstract: "Across low and middle-income countries (LMICs) there are “missing women”, meaning that there are fewer women alive today than there demographically should be (Sen, 1992). Substantial research attention has been paid to “missing” female babies and girls – that is female children that are never born (Nie, 2011) and girls that never reach adulthood due to systematic neglect (Garg & Morduch, 1998; Gupta, 2002; Oster, 2009, 2016). However, more recent research indicates that the largest number of “missing women” are of adult age and would live in sub-Saharan Africa (Anderson & Ray, 2010; Bongaarts & Guilmoto, 2015). Comparatively less research attention has been paid to excess female mortality in adulthood and to the question of why women die prematurely. Anderson & Ray (2010) show that the largest number of “missing women” can be attributed to HIV/AIDS, injuries, and cardiovascular diseases – which disproportionally affect women. There is currently no consensus on whether these deaths are due to biological factors or whether they are due to gender-based discrimination. Determining why women die prematurely is key for developing adequate policy solutions and reaching key international development targets related to women’s health, such as the Sustainable Development Goals. 

This study examines whether women face gender-based discrimination when they seek care and collects data in 250 primary care facilities in Naiorbi county Kenya. The proposed study has two main objectives. First, it uses male and female standardised patients (SPs) – healthy people pretending to be ill and visiting healthcare providers under-cover – to examine whether women with symptoms of coronary heart disease (i.e. chest pain) receive worse healthcare than men. Second, it provides evidence on how any potential gender-based discrimination might be remedied and tests the short-term effect of a provider training intervention.
