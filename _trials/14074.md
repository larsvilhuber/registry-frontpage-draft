abstract: "This study is designed to assess the effect of two alternative policy measures aimed at curbing the dissemination of false news on social media: fact-checking and priming users of social or reputational costs of sharing misinformation. The study will be based on a randomized experiment with actual users of X (formerly Twitter). 

The purpose of the study is threefold:
1) Estimate the effect of two policies that have been proposed in the public debate to limit the circulation of fake news, on social media: (1) making reputational or social costs of sharing false news more salient through a nudge and (2) offering fact checking of the content.

2) Using structural estimation, we will estimate parameters of the utility function of shares of news on social media that explain the motivation behind the decision to share news (true or false). In particular, we will estimate how individuals trade off the following 3 motives: partisan persuasion, partisan signaling, and reputation concerns.

3) We will use the results of structural estimation to evaluate the channels through which the policies affect the sharing of true and false news.
