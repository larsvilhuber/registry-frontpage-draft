abstract: "A key barrier to labor market integration for refugees – particularly refugees in urban, non-camp settings – is a lack of social and business networks. While a growing number of interventions focus on building refugees’ economic and human capital, we know little about what works to improve their social capital, which is critical for refugee self-reliance. This study is a randomized control trial testing whether an intervention aimed at expanding and diversifying networks can improve microenterprise success and social cohesion among urban refugees and vulnerable hosts in Uganda and Kenya. The intervention provides refugee and host entrepreneurs with business grants and randomly assigns them to small, fixed business groups – aimed at forging strong ties – or large, rotating business groups – aimed at forging weak ties – and varies the composition of the groups along nationality lines. The overall aim of connecting different entrepreneurs through business groups is to support self-employment, business formation, and social cohesion. Our key research questions are: (1) how can interventions support the development of business and social networks for refugees and nationals in urban markets of developing countries; (2) are these interventions effective at improving livelihood outcomes and social inclusion; and (3) what kinds of networks are more or less impactful at improving business and social outcomes?"
