abstract: "One in four university students experience mental health disorders (MHD). This is an age group in which the risk of MHD is particularly high, and care-seeking particularly low. I plan to evaluate, through a randomized control trial experiment run at the University of Amsterdam, whether an over-the-phone psychological counselling service has the potential to improve students’ mental health, decision making and, as a by-product, enhance their academic performance. In addition, this study will investigate the underlying mechanisms of why and for whom the intervention works in order to provide better tailored mental health services. "
