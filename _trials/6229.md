abstract: "Advice should (rationally) be followed by an advisee if accepting it leads to a higher expected payoff than ignoring it. Whether, when and why people deviate from this are important social science questions. We wish to explore the behavioral factors (i.e., those outside the standard rational economic paradigm) that may lie behind such deviations from rationality."
