abstract: "The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of a social contact and education intervention to improve attitudes to mental illness in first-year social work students (Universitat de Barcelona). This is a three-month cluster randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms: intervention  and control group. The students will be divided into eight classes which will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention group and control group. The intervention is a workshop led by an OBERTAMENT activist (a person with a mental illness trained in communication skills and empowerment by a social worker). We assess intended future behaviour toward people with mental illness (RIBS), personal and perceived stigma (DSS), and mental-health related attitudes (CAMI). Baseline comparability between groups will be assessed using  chi-square tests, Fisher's exact test or Student's t-test. Missing data will be imputed using multiple imputation with chained equations. Differences between groups will be assessed using multivariate lineal regression models. "
