abstract: "We study the impact that perspective-taking through online role-playing can have on promoting altruism and trust by improving empathy and reducing prejudice. For this purpose we will randomly assign Colombian citizens to an online experience called “In Someone Else’s Shoes” (En Otros Zapatos, https://enotroszapatos.iadb.org/). In this experience they are told they are a Venezuelan female migrant and they are presented with this person’s story. Immersion is achieved in several ways: participants not only read the character’s story, but they also receive e-mails, voice and text messages from family and friends from the imaginary character and they also have to make decisions as if they were the character. We will also assess the impacts of presenting information about the perils of the Venezuelan migrants’ experiences in Colombia. We will test the effectiveness of the program relative to a treatment arm that consists of watching a video of migrants which attempt to causing emotion."
