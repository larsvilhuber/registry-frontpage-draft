abstract: "This study will be replicating “Propensities to engage in and punish corrupt behavior: Experimental evidence from Australia, India, Indonesia and Singapore” (Cameron et al., 2009) in America. The original study found support for the claim that the level of corruption of a country given by corruption indices is correlated with the willingness to engage and punish corrupt behavior of the country's citizens. So, this study will see if American citizens are more willing to engage or punish corrupt behavior and compare that to the country's corruption indices. Corruption will be modeled through a one-shot, sequential corruption game based on bribery taken from Cameron et al. (2009) where there are three players: a firm, a public official, and a citizen. The firm offers a bribe to the public official where they can accept or reject the bribe. If the bribe is rejected the game is over. But if the bribe is accepted, the citizen loses money and they will have the opportunity to punish the firm and the public official  financially. We hypothesize that America will have a lower propensity to engage in corruption due to its good standing against corruption as shown in indices,"
