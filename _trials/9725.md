abstract: "In targeted antipoverty programs, the definition of deprivation determines who is in need, who receives program benefits, and, through them, program effects. Deprivation can be experienced in a wide range of dimensions, however, leading to tradeoffs in the determination of who is poor. We  pre-specify the analysis of a nationwide field experiment in which we estimate the effects of targeting unconditional cash transfers to alternative measures of deprivation. To do this, we partnered with leading humanitarian agencies in Lebanon to experimentally vary the poverty measure used to target an at-scale year-long structured cash assistance program for refugees. Targeting among similar populations with the same amount of resources, we will estimate the program effect resulting from each of the alternative poverty targets across a range of economic well-being indicators. We further pre-specify the protocol for qualitative data collection and quantitative data analysis aimed at understanding the mechanisms that lead to differences in targeting effects."
