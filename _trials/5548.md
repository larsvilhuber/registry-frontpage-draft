abstract: "There is growing recognition of the importance of soft skills in improving young people’s labor market outcomes. However, rigorous measurement of specific soft skills in the context of a large-scale field study is often challenging, and hence there is little evidence on the levels of some such skills among vulnerable youth populations, as well as potential gender gaps in such skills. Moreover, there is little causal evidence as to which skills or sets of skills are most malleable in late adolescence and early adulthood, and which may have the highest labor-market returns for such populations. This study will deploy novel measures of key soft skills with a sample of young male and female adults in urban and peri-urban Tanzania. Building on recent advances in psychology and behavioral economics, as well as BRAC’s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) curriculum, we will create training modules focusing on two different sets of soft skills. We will use an individual-level randomized controlled trial to estimate the causal impacts of these trainings on young men and women's skills and on their labor market outcomes. "
