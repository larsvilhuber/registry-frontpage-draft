abstract: "Most sub-Saharan African countries use a colonial language such as English or French as the medium of instruction. This language of instruction policy imposes great learning barriers to students who do not have fluency in the language. We study the impacts of learning in the mother tongue (Chichewa), compared to English in 32 primary schools in Malawi. We randomly recruit 854 students out of 4950 who just completed 4th and 5th grades for a 7-week-long summer learning camp, in which local, regular primary school teachers provided math and social studies lessons. In addition, we randomized the language of instruction: of the summer school participants, 419 students were taught in English and 435 were taught in Chichewa. Our research will provide important policy implications for the promotion of mother tongue education."
