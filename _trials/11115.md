abstract: "The objective of this study is to analyze the behavior and explore the effectiveness of individual and collective sequential search in a laboratory experiment. The design of our experiment is based on the work of Albrecht, Anderson, and Vroman (JET, 2010). Our aim is to evaluate the predictions of that model and identify factors, including behavioral, that were not accounted for. We are particularly interested in understanding the impact of committee size, voting rules, and offer distributions on search duration, strategies adopted by participants, and ultimately, their welfare."
