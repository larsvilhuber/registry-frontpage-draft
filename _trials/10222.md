abstract: "We conduct a world-wide survey experiment in 60 countries with more than 60’000 participants and implement a between-subject design to measure paternalistic preferences. We collect attitudes towards government interventions and randomly vary the nature of the intervention: either interventions that limit freedom (hard paternalism) or interventions that do not limit freedom (soft paternalism). Furthermore, we complement the general question on government interventions with questions on specific policies to learn about the determinants of policy attitudes. Finally, we measure respondents’ beliefs about the ability of individuals to make good decisions for themselves and confidence in the governments ability to make good decisions for its citizens, as well as the respondents’ perception of their own personal freedom.
