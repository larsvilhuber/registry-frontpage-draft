abstract: "I am studying the impact of different forms of payment, specifically the digital payment platform Venmo, on consumer willingness to pay (WTP). I will be conducting an online experiment via Amazon mTurk to measure how willingness to pay changes across form of payment, specifically comparing Venmo to debit and credit cards. In the online experiment, participants will be randomly assigned to a form of payment and participate in 10 BDM lotteries for 10 different low-cost items (like a bar of soap, can of soda, or a pen) to determine their willingness to pay for each item. After the BDM lotteries, if the participant won more than one lottery, one winning item will be randomly selected for the participant to purchase; they will provide payment information through a secure checkout and we will ship the item to them. In addition to comparing WTP across payment types, we will also examine how different aspects of Venmo, like the various privacy settings and the social media feeds, impact WTP. "
