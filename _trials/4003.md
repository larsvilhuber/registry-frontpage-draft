abstract: "The increasing availability of low-cost mobile phones and mobile Internet access in emerging markets has led to widespread use of social media platforms, making them an important source of news and place for social and political activity. This trend has brought many new users online including those with limited exposure to technology. Concurrently, we have also observed an increasing trend in the spread of misinformation on such platforms. The spread of misinformation can create and exacerbate polarization, while also affecting the beliefs and actions of users without a prior ideological leaning.  We carry out a household level survey which provides unique first-hand evidence on the trends in social media use, sharing of news, and spread of misinformation among low and middle-income users in Pakistan. Using a list of actual news stories circulated on social media we create a test to measure the extent to which users are likely to believe and share misinformation. We evaluate the effectiveness of two interventions for countering misinformation in a randomized control setting. Our first intervention educates users about common features of misinformation through a video, while our second intervention in addition to the video provides specific feedback to users about their own past behaviour in engaging with misinformation. We measure the effectiveness of our interventions on future behaviour of participants in believing and sharing misinformation."
