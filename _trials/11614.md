abstract: "This project is a complementary experimental study that replicates previous experiments in the entrepreneurial financing setting. The goal is to address any concerns about previous experiments' external validity and experimental power.

It aims to answer the following research questions:

a. Do U.S. early-stage investors discriminate against women-led startups and Asian-led startups?
If so, what's the mechanisms? Is this mainly driven by implicit discrimination? 
(Replicate “Discrimination in the Venture Capital Industry: Evidence from Field Experiments,” 2020 by Ye Zhang)

b. How do U.S. early-stage investors evaluate impact ventures versus profit-driven ventures? (replicate Zhang 2021)
(Replicate "Impact Investing and the Venture Capital Industry: Experimental Evidence," 2021 by Ye Zhang)

c. What other startup human and non-human characteristics also influence U.S. early-stage investors' investment evaluations and decisions? (Replicate “How Venture Capitalists and Startups Bet on Each Other: Evidence From an Experimental System,” 2020 by Ye Zhang and Mehran Ebrahimian.)
