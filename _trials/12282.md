abstract: "Crowdsourcing is increasingly utilized for the collection of agricultural information in remote and fragile contexts. Agricultural information crowdsourcing initiatives can influence decision making and behavior. Recent efforts use such initiatives to dynamically monitor shocks and inform early warning and anticipatory action. The relevance of such information depends on the ability to reach the target audience (in our case, the pastoralists) in a timely manner. This requires dissemination of the information. While there has been considerable effort to collect crowdsourced information, very little attention has been placed on its dissemination for decision making. Therefore, knowledge on the access, use, and effect of such information is inadequate. This knowledge gap makes it difficult to conclude whether and the extent to which agricultural information crowdsourcing initiatives are beneficial. This study, implemented within a pastoralist setting, attempts to fill this gap by conducting a cluster-randomized controlled trial (cluster RCT) to assess access and use of livestock information collected via the KAZNET initiative. The study further assesses the welfare effects of the KAZNET livestock information crowdsourcing initiative and probes the mechanisms through which such effects occur. The RCT randomizes 200 villages into one treatment arm and one control arm. The treatment arm is assigned to receive KAZNET livestock information via a mobile phone dashboard. The control arm is not signed up to receive KAZNET livestock information. Within each village, we target pastoralist groups/associations for the KAZNET livestock information diffusion."
