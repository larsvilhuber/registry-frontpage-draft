abstract: "We conduct a natural eld experiment to study gender discrimination against
prospective next-generation researchers (pre-PhD level students) in the economics
profession. We send emails to members of the professional association of German-
speaking economists in which we invite the members to participate in a survey.
The survey invitations are part of an actual research project of two non-ctitious
Master's-degree students at a Swiss university, one of whom is female and one is
male. We randomly vary between email recipients if the email is sent and signed
by the male or female student. We nd, on average across all email recipients, that
the overall response rate is higher if the email sender is female. However, we nd
strong evidence for same-sex discrimination. Female economists strongly discrim-
inate against the female email sender, while male economists discriminate against
the male email sender. Same-sex discrimination among women is prevalent among
tenured and non-tenured recipients. Same-sex discrimination among men is only
observed for tenured recipients. The latter result implies that the average overall
eect (favorable treatment of female sender) is driven by tenured male recipients.
Our results have implications for policies supporting female economists."
