abstract: "We investigate whether self-chosen goals are effective at increasing gym attendance. Members that buy a new contract at the health club we are cooperating with are randomly assigned to one of three groups. Groups 1 and 2 are not asked to state any exercising goals in terms of weekly visits to the gym. The difference between the two groups is that group 1 does not receive any emails, while the group 2 receives very general reminders about the opportunity to exercise at the club every month. The third group is asked to state an explicit exercising goal in terms of weekly attendance when they sign up at the gym. In addition, this group receives the same, very general reminder emails that are sent to group 2. However, in addition to the general content used in the emails to group 2, these emails also contain the individual exercising goals as stated when buying the contract. We will collect detailed attendance data during the intervention period, as well as during (at least) three subsequent months to investigate long run effects."
