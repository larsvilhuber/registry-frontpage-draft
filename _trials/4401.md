abstract: "When people receive information about controversial issues such as immigration policies, upward mobility, and racial discrimination, the information often evokes both what they currently believe and what they are motivated to believe. Motivated reasoning posits that people misupdate from information by treating these motivated beliefs as an extra signal. The main objective of this experiment is to test whether a "debiasing treatment" can attenuate motivated reasoning. This treatment tells people when they have erred and asks them their opinion on whether motivated reasoning played a role. Relating motivated reasoning to other biases and phenomenons, this experiment tests whether the debiasing treatment reduces polarization, makes people less overprecise, and has them form more accurate assessments of the veracity of news sources.
