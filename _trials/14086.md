abstract: "We study patterns of AI adoption in a dynamic setting, where subjects are allowed to learn about AI performance. We test predictions of a theoretical model of dynamic adoption under misspecified beliefs, which we call "anthropomorphic". The model predicts patterns of over- and under-adoption of AI: AI is used for tasks in which it may perform relatively worse than humans."
