abstract: "In this project, we investigate fairness preferences in the field. In particular, we analyze how fairness preferences are formed and whether they are influenced by real-life events. We analyze the admission process for medical studies, one of the most prestigious study fields in Germany. We also analyze whether making one's own outcome of the admission process salient leads to a divergence of preferences and beliefs, and whether providing balanced information about the process is a remedy against this potential divergence.
