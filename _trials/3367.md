abstract: "This project studies a randomized EdTech/AI intervention that helps parents strategize in a centralized school choice setting that rewards knowledge of admissions probabilities for different submitted portfolios. Many districts have implemented centralized assignment mechanisms that reward strategic play (see e.g. Agarwal and Somaini 2018). Prior studies indicate that many households lack the information on admissions probabilities necessary for optimal play (Kapor, Neilson, and Zimmerman 2018), and that this reduces overall welfare relative to alternative assignment mechanisms that only require households to report their own preferences truthfully. However, this work also suggests that a “best-case” personalized informational intervention in which households learn true admissions probabilities could lead to welfare outcomes that beat the strategy-proof assignment mechanisms. The first goal of this study is to see whether AI assistance that provides simulations of person-specific, application-specific assignment probabilities can approximate this best-case scenario, and to understand the distributional implications of such interventions when implemented at scale.

The second goal is to understand how households in school choice markets make dynamic tradeoffs between schools they like now and access to better schools in the future.  We address this question in the context of survey questions that ask students about their preferences over and understanding of this tradeoff, and an informational intervention that helps them understand how the tradeoff depends on submitted applications to the choice system.
