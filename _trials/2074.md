abstract: "
More than 46 million people in the United States live in poverty. The issue of poverty is particularly pervasive in the city of Rochester, NY. The Rochester-Monroe Anti-Poverty Initiative (RMAPI), in partnership with the New York Governor's State Anti-Poverty Task Force, is piloting a program to target poverty in the Rochester-Monroe region. Exhaustive community research has led RMAPI to pilot an adult mentor/navigator program that addresses the issues identified as pervasive in the city of Rochester: a knowledge gap about available services and how to navigate them, and a need for coordinated services.

In order to measure the pilot's success and make decisions about scaling the program up, RMAPI has asked the Wilson Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunities from the University of Notre Dame to run an evaluation of the pilot as a randomized controlled trial. This evaluation will test the hypothesis that providing a professional mentor/navigator program in a targeted area of concentrated poverty will increase economic mobility for program participants, resulting in improved self-sufficiency. Results from this study will inform policy decisions not only in the city of Rochester, but may be disseminated to policy makers in other regions to inform the design of future anti-poverty initiatives.
