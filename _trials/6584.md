abstract: "Gender quotas in politics are often introduced as measures to increase womenâ€™s representation in parliaments and cabinets, trigger societal change, and ultimately promote fairer gender norms. We study one of the first systems of gender quotas, implemented in Tanzania in 1985 as a number of reserved seats for women in parliament. We conduct an online survey to measure preferences for numerical and substantive representation of women in the national parliament and its national committees, and conduct four information experiments to study perceptions of fairness, meritocracy and patronage in relation to the gender quota in Tanzania. The analysis contributes to research on preferences for inequality and redistributive policies (quotas and affirmative action) in politics.
