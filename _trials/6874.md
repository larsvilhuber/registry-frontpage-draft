abstract: "Local governments in middle-income countries have promoted the installation of containers to increase the collection of materials with potential for recycling. However, the level of collected materials is still very low, and concerns on the cleanness of the neighborhood’s surroundings due to misuse of recycling containers have emerged.  The objective of this research is to evaluate the impact of a set of alternative policy instruments aimed at encouraging participation in recycling schemes by urban households. In particular, we are interested in studying the effect of the provision of a curbside collection system on the recycling of plastic and waste sorting by households once fixed containers are available. Special attention is given to the interactions between both types of infrastructure. Also, we explore whether appealing to personal norms has a reinforcement effect on the recycling of plastic and waste sorting. The study will be carried out in the city of Osorno, in southern Chile, with the support of the local Municipality, and with the collaboration of the leading recycling company in the city. We will collect information on recycling material two times per week for a set of containers previously installed in two similar sectors, over 18 months. Finally, we will conduct ex-ante and ex-post surveys to gather household-level data in the proximity of the infrastructure. This intervention will provide valuable insights regarding the effects of these instruments on the disposal of plastics in the urban residential setting."
