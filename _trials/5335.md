abstract: "An online randomized controlled trial on media usage was conducted in the greater Tokyo area in November and December 2016. As the main treatment, we randomly provided free subscriptions to view Japan Broadcasting Corporation's programs online. In particular, treated individuals could view the programs on web browsers and mobile phones. The services comprised live streaming and video on demand. The treatment thus increased the capacity for viewing the Japan Broadcasting Corporation's programs.
