abstract: "Our work studies sucker aversion, an aversion to being or being seen as a naïve cooperator. In our study, suckers are identified as people who use the possibility (no matter how miniscule) that an undeserving other (a country club) might receive a payoff as an excuse to forego donating to charity. We specifically investigate the relationship between sucker aversion types and a set of information treatments. To test our hypotheses, we implement a Qualtrics survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk with about 400 participants. "
