abstract: "This study will examine aid allocation decisions in a sample of policy makers from various governmental and non-governmental agencies in Kathmandu, Nepal, in the aftermath of the 2015 earthquake. Although much aid and relief material has arrived in Nepal after the earthquake, there is concern that aid materials may not be reaching the people who actually need it. This study will examine several factors which may influence decision making of policymakers in order to determine now real-life decision makers consider various forms of information. Although decisions regarding the allocation of aid are complex and require decision-makers to analyze a large amount of information regarding which populations are in need, and where previous aid has been provided, the availability of information does not guarantee its use in policy decisions. Indeed, many studies have identified a gap between the belief of social scientists that the information they produce should be used to inform policymaking and the real life behavior of individual policy-makers. Thus, this study will examine how a sample of real-world policy makers use informational input to inform their decision making process in the aftermath of a natural disaster. "
