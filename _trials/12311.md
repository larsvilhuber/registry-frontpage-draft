abstract: "Through a randomised, vignette-based survey experiment, we intend to establish a causal link between a belief in karma and gendered differences in the likelihood of seeking redressal for an individual’s digital financial services (DFS)-related issues. As a secondary goal, we also investigate a causal link between the prevalence of discriminatory gender norms (normative and empirical expectations of raising complaints and redressal supply-side gender discrimination) and the likelihood of seeking redressal through formal mechanisms. Vignette group 1 is a 2x2 design vignette that varies the gender of the protagonist and their belief in karma. All survey respondents are randomly assigned to one of the four vignettes. After being exposed to their respective vignette, respondents are asked to answer a common set of outcome measures regarding their perceptions of the protagonist’s likelihood of seeking redressal through formal and informal complaint mechanisms, preferred mode of informal redressal, and supply-side discrimination. We hypothesise that after observing the treatment vignettes in vignette group 1 wherein the community believes in karma,  respondents would rate the respondent the protagonist as less likely to seek redressal for their problem, as compared to those vignettes which do not mention that the community believes in karma."
