abstract: "Is financial aid in higher education an effective use of funds? Research on this question has been complicated both by selection bias and the high implicit tax rates imposed by an array of over-lapping need-based programs. We are conducting a randomized evaluation of private post-secondary aid and support services for low-income students applying to public colleges and universities. The program we studied, which primarily serves a Pell-eligible population, distributes $20 million in aid to over 3,000 students annually. Unlike Pell, however, award criteria included indicators of college readiness.  Outcomes of interest include continuation and completion rates, completion times, academic performance, and degrees obtained. Broadly, we are interested in the following two questions: 1) How does financial support affect the educational attainment of recipients? 2) How do support services affect the educational attainment of scholarship recipients? 

After the initial assessment of educational attainment outcomes, we are interested in following up on labor market outcomes, such as wages and credit."
