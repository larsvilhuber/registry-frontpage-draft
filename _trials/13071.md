abstract: "Free legal assistance is available to income-eligible tenants facing eviction in Eastern Virginia through a regional legal aid provider. This organization is contacted by a small fraction of eligible clients. They hypothesize that low service take-up is due to a lack of awareness about the availability of services. This project is conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess whether mailing letters to tenants facing eviction about their impending court date and about legal aid increases service inquiries and service take-up, and whether it affects court outcomes."
