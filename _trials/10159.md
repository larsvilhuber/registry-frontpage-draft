abstract: "This project will study whether we can reduce food waste in restaurants by giving people the possibility of donating food to a Food Bank.

The experiment we propose is as follows. 

The restaurant will offer a choice of two options:

1)	Order a meal which is the normal price and the normal portion.  
2)	Order a meal that is only 75% as large as the usual portion, with the other 25% of the ingredients going to a food charity (e.g., the Food Bank). Customers still pay the normal price of the meal as it was a regular size meal.

We think that many people know that they wonâ€™t finish a full meal and won't take it home.  We suspect that many of these people would be happy  to know they weren't wasting food and would donate.  All the donations would be done in terms of ingredients, not as food that has been already cooked.
