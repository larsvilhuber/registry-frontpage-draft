abstract: "We are investigating the study abroad interests of Chinese undergraduates at the broad level. We are targeting a broad range of universities in China at different places randomly. Specifically, we wish to find out the factors that influence students' decision making, what is the behind the study abroad motive, what do students expect in return for this sizable investment. We also plan to study from the perspective of education policy making, will excessive promotion of study abroad cause a brain drain effect in China? If so, what can policy makers, university officials do to mediate the action? In a series of questions asked in the survey, we anticipate implications can be drawn. "
