abstract: "In this experiment, we present participants with a lottery framed as revenue derived from the sale of maize production on an agricultural plot. We then offer participants the opportunity to purchase various forms of insurance against negative lottery outcomes. The insurance choice is presented under various conditions that alter the transparency of the contract and the participant's return from the lottery. We make real payouts to participants based on one such decision to incentivize accurate reporting. Participant willingness-to-pay for insurance constitutes the primary outcome data from this trial."
