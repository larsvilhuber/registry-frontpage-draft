abstract: "We will run an MTurk experiment to examine several basic biases that we think are present in annuity choice decisions. The study will use simple and abstract decision scenarios that consist of several "accounts" and several states that determine payoffs. The goal of this study will be to test for two biases. The first is the "insurance heuristic"--an aversion to moving currency to a state of the world in which payoffs are already high, even if the marginal utility from currency is also high in that state of the world. The second is status quo bias, which we conjecture to be stronger when the options are more complex."
