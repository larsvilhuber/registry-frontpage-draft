abstract: "The goal of the study is to understand drivers' risk-taking behavior and how they form their beliefs about the risk of accidents. Taxi-drivers in Liberia will be recruited to participate in a lab-in-the-field experiment. As they join the experiment, drivers will be randomly assigned to one of the following groups: control group, road safety training, business training. Before and after their training (or consecutively for the control group), drivers will complete surveys and complete games that will allow the research team to estimate their beliefs and behavioral measures.
