abstract: "This study examines whether in-class experiments help students learn important Economics lessons better than traditional methods. To address this question, we conduct an experiment in undergraduate Introductory Microeconomics and Macroeconomics classes. In each section of a class, we randomize two lessons out of four potential candidates into treatment or control. Treatment lessons are taught using an in-class experiment or similar active-learning activity that is designed to illustrate the topic. Control lessons are taught using traditional techniques. Our design follows the recommendations of Wozny et al. (2018) by randomizing across lessons within a given course, increasing the power of our statistical tests. For each of these four lessons, the instructors give a multiple choice quiz after they have finished teaching the topic.  We also ask several multiple choice questions on the course final exam related to each of these lessons. This allows us to measure both whether the experiments help students learn key lessons better than traditional techniques in both the short term and the long term. We also investigate whether the effect of these techniques varies by gender, topic area (micro vs. macro) and instructor type (adjunct, lecturer, or tenured/tenure track). The classes in our sample are taught mostly by instructors who are inexperienced in the use of experiments as a teaching tool, so our results should be generalizable to schools that have not commonly used this technique."
