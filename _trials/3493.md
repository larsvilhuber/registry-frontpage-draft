abstract: "This study aims to provide experimental evidence that caste identity concerns affect daily wage workers’ labor supply decisions in rural India. In an incentive compatible choice experiment, a worker hears about a number of potential one-day job offers, and indicates whether he is willing to take up each of the offers. The job offers involve working on different tasks—some of which are associated with specific castes—as well as working on these tasks for different amounts of time, with the total working time and offered wages held fixed. Using these variations, I test whether workers are more likely to turn down the job offers that conflict with their caste identity."
