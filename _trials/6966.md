abstract: "How do managers convey information to employees about their performance? Are they averse to giving bad news, or are they more likely to withhold good information? This project examines the biases that managers hold when providing feedback to their employees. Biased feedback communication can distort employees’ perceptions about their abilities, which may, in turn, alter their willingness to compete for promotion or roles with better career prospects. Using a series of controlled experiments, we examine biases in feedback provision, and how these interact with the employee’s gender. Understanding these biases and their impact on behavior is an important step to breaking down the barriers inhibiting women from taking up leadership roles. Our experimental design will allow us to examine the relationship between feedback provision and the impact that biased performance feedback may have on employees’ beliefs and behavior."
