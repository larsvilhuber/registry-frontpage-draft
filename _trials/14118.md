abstract: "Smallholder farmers in developing countries face multiple constraints to improve productivity: poor access to credit, labor, information, and capabilities. In such settings, alleviating any one constraint may not be enough, bundled interventions may be more effective in improving agricultural outcomes. Furthermore, the severity of these constraints often varies significantly across gender. We partner with a multi-national coffee buyer to provide and evaluate a bundle of services (Farmer Upgrading ‘Program’) that simultaneously relaxes resource and knowledge constraints faced by coffee farmers in the buyer’s supply chain in Rwanda. We experimentally test the effectiveness of improving access to labor, finance, and knowledge, both as stand-alone and in combination of interventions relaxing resource constraints. We will generate evidence on bundles of services which are likely to increase agricultural productivity and foster convergence between male and female smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa. "
