abstract: "An emerging body of empirical work emphasizes the demand for effective mitigation measures against severe seasonal ambient air pollution in developing cities. Yet, governments in developing countries often struggle to provide consistent and reliable air quality information. In such an environment, private alternatives to government services may improve citizens' access to air quality information. However, the efficacy of private alternatives may depend upon citizens' preferences for and beliefs about the accuracy of the information sources. We study how the source of environmental information affects citizens’ beliefs about the level of air quality and their protection measures against polluted air. In this field experiment, we vary the salience of information sources---the government vs. a private citizens group---of air pollution forecasts we provide in Lahore, Pakistan. We will measure the changes in people’s beliefs about air pollution levels and preferences for government services on air quality information through incentive-compatible elicitation games."
