abstract: "We conduct a Randomised Control Trial (RCT) with school going children (aged 10-14 years) from a sample of districts in Pakistanâ€™s Punjab. We aim to assess the impact of a low cost, easily scalable, touch-and-go psychological intervention aimed at improving well-being and, consequently, test scores. We implement this positive psychology intervention among 1000 school children across 30 schools. Our intervention is randomised at the school level. The treatment group receives the positive psychology intervention, while the control group engages in the meantime in non psychology-related activities. We will measure the impact of our intervention on improving child well-being and academic performance in the short run (immediately after the intervention), medium run (six-months after the intervention), and one-year mark. Our findings will contribute to understanding the production function of human capital and whether light touch psycho-social interventions can improve outcomes for children in low income settings. "
