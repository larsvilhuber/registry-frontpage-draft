abstract: "Expecting women and their partners in urban Africa face a wide variety of choices of where to deliver babies.  Many public and private delivery options exist, but reliable information about the quality or cost of facilities is lacking. Women do not always coordinate with their families to save enough money for delivery. Furthermore, labor often begins at an unplanned time or place, leaving women without appropriate transport, supplies, and necessary childcare for other children. These factors often lead to late arrival at whatever facility is closest and affordable or, in some cases, to home delivery. Preliminary research in Nairobi revealed that nearly half the time women do not end up delivering where they intended. The central idea behind our project is that behavioral barriers to deciding where to deliver represent a significant component of delays in reaching timely, high quality maternal and newborn health care. We will conduct a pilot study in Nairobi to test simple interventions addressing behavioral and structural barriers to arriving safely at a high quality delivery facility. We will relieve behavioral barriers by encouraging pre-commitments about where to deliver and structural barriers by providing cash transfers to help offset the costs of delivery (including transport). Our hypothesis is that encouraging expecting women to pre-commit to a delivery location will reduce delays in reaching the facility and increase the quality of the facility used. "
