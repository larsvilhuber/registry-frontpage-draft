abstract: "Seasonal commodity price fluctuations can potentially offer farmers inter-temporal arbitrage opportunities to increase their income.  However, smallholder farmers in most of sub-Saharan Africa often do not exploit these opportunities to the fullest extent possible. We administered a randomized control trial (RCT) among 1,739 smallholder farmers in Malawi to evaluate the impacts of storage and commitment constraints on farmersâ€™ legume storage decisions (soybeans and groundnuts). The treated groups received (i) an improved storage technology in the form of two hermetic (airtight) bags (T1: technology only); (ii) the same improved storage technology under the condition that farmers store collectively with their farmer club members in their village, (T2: village storage program) and (iii) the improved storage technology under the condition that farmers store collectively at a centralized association warehouse (T3: warehouse storage program). We analyzed the impacts of these treatments on the following outcomes: quantity stored, number of weeks stored before the largest sale, net sales quantity and net sales revenue. Our results showed that all three storage interventions helped farmers store more legumes at harvest, store longer, and increase revenue from legume sales compared to control households. Our results also showed that the village storage program was relatively more effective at incentivizing farmers to store legumes compared to the warehouse storage program. The finding suggests that providing improved storage technologies and encouraging farmers to store with others in their village may be more effective strategies for them to capture intra-seasonal arbitrage opportunities than promoting larger-scale warehouse receipt-type systems.
