abstract: "We will evaluate the effectiveness of direct cash payments as a supplement to rapid rehousing services for preventing homelessness and aiding the transition to longer-term housing stability. Working with two Bay Area providers of rapid rehousing, we will recruit between 400 and 450 families with children experiencing homelessness. All will receive housing search assistance, case management, and a short-term rental subsidy for up to 24 months. Half will be randomly selected to receive a monthly cash payment of \$1000 for 12 months after they complete 18 months in rapid rehousing. These payments will extend beyond the end of rapid rehousing services, easing the transition away from rental subsidies. Using administrative data, we will estimate the effect of this intervention on returns to homelessness, housing stability, housing and neighborhood quality, and rent burden in the 12 months after the payments end. To understand mechanisms, we will evaluate the effect of the cash payments on measures of employment, income, savings, health, and psychological well-being. "
