abstract: "We conduct two coin-toss experiments (Add-on Studies 1 and 2) with a representative target sample of 5,000 participants each, using Dynata’s online panel. Each participant is randomly assigned to a pair of entities and instructed to toss a coin twice. Participants are asked to report the results of their coin tosses to determine the entity that will receive a USD 5 reward (they can choose to lie). Our main aims are to examine (1) whether people would act dishonestly for one entity instead of another in each trade-off context (e.g., Will people act dishonesty to benefit themselves at the expense of the environment?) (hypotheses about specific trade-off contexts), (2) whether people’s dishonesty to benefit a given entity depends on trade-off context (e.g., Will people act dishonestly to benefit themselves more if it is at the expense of a stranger than if it is at the expense of a random stranger?) (hypotheses across trade-off contexts), and (3) whether people would act less dishonestly when given the option to toss a coin either in private or on a platform where they may be monitored (Add-on Study 2) than when instructed to toss a coin in private (Add-on Study 1)."
