abstract: "This follow-up survey experiment serves as a complementary study to the field letter experiment conducted in collaboration with the Financial Administration in Slovakia. The primary objective of the initial field experiment was to boost the collection of Capital Gain Tax on property by sending informative letters to potential evaders, emphasizing their obligations. Different versions of these letters, some accompanied by graphical leaflets, were employed. In this follow-up survey experiment, our focus is directed towards understanding the respondents’ perceptions and interpretations of the letters and leaflets. We aim to gauge their satisfaction with the provided information and delve into various clarification aspects. "
