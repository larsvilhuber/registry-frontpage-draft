abstract: "In the context of pawnbroker lending, we show that forcing people into commitment contracts with financial penalties for not paying on time decreases their (fee-including) financial cost by 9.5%, increases the likelihood of recovering their pawn by 25%, and increases the likelihood of repeat business by 55%. Using machine learning methods for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, we find that more than 90% clients would reduce their financing cost with the commitment contract, however only 10% choose it. Relying on personal promises instead of fees as commitment triples take-up but has no effects on outcomes."
