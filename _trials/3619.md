abstract: "Literacy rates in developing countries remain lagged behind their developed counterparts; a key barrier for human capital formation. In North West Nigeria, fewer than fifteen percent of children can read a complete sentence (Nigeria Education Data Survey, 2010). Adverse social norms, parental attitudes and lack of information about education greatly explain why half of children do not attend primary school. To help educational systems leapfrog and improve learning outcomes, this RCT provides an opportunity to test the effect of an educational entertainment and digital app intervention to inform policy makers and development partners about how such interventions may influence literacy rates of children and parental attitudes toward education.

This RCT is compounded by two interventions. The first is a social norms campaign that will consist of community screenings, the provision of information about the benefits of education, and post-screening discussions structured around the aspirational and social norms messages of the edu-tainment screenings. The second intervention is a mobile-based edu-tainment intervention that consists of educational games and digital books designed for early grade reading. Both interventions will involve teachers to strengthen links with school activities and community leaders to increase the take-up of both interventions. While the social norms campaign will aim to change parentsâ€™ attitudes toward primary education, as well as increase school enrolment and retention rates; the mobile intervention will serve as a treatment enforcer aimed at improving reading and writing (half of treatment participants in community screenings will receive a pre-loaded mobile phone with digital books and games for learning). Both interventions will take place in North West Nigeria in the states of Kano and Jigawa.
