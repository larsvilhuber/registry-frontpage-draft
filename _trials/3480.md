abstract: "The purpose of this study is to increase attendance among chronically absent students through monthly text messages and emails to parents of these children. The study will use existing messaging platforms in four school districts in the metro Atlanta area. The content of the text messages and emails vary slightly based on the age group of the students. Parents of children in grades K-8 will receive messages informing them about their child’s attendance and how it compares to their peers. The content for parents of high school students in grades 9-12 will contain information about their child’s attendance, how it compares to their peers, and how it relates to high school graduation. 
Researchers will work with the data provided by the school districts to identify students with chronic absenteeism and assign them to treatment and control groups. The treatment group will receive the text messages while the control group will not receive any messages. At the end of the school year, researchers will analyze the impact of the monthly messages (text and email) on the treated group’s attendance relative to the control group."
