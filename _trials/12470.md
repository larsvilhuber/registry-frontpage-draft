abstract: "This project investigates the role of over- and underconfidence in belief updating and recall of feedback. While previous research finds mixed results for how positive and negative feedback impacts belief updating and recall, the overall focus has been on how (asymmetric) belief updating affects individuals’ confidence. Instead, we ask how exogenously inducing high or low confidence impacts feedback processing. In addition, we study whether confidence and its impacts on belief updating have persistent effects on the recall of feedback."
