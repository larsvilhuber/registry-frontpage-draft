abstract: "The proposed study is a survey experiment, which will be carried out in several different countries. In each country, survey participants will be randomized into different information treatments. Individuals in the ‘Treatment 1’ group will receive truthful information on health-related aspects of the coronavirus outbreak. ‘Treatment 2’ will receive the same information as ‘Treatment 1’ and will additionally be informed about economic consequences of the outbreak. ‘Treatment 3’ will receive the same information as ‘Treatment 1’ and will additionally receive information on workers without paid sick leave. The ‘Control’ group will receive none of the above information. The goal of the study is to explore how different treatments affect (1) individual perceptions of the severity of the coronavirus outbreak and the adequacy of the policy response to the crisis, (2) individual valuations of different work arrangements, and (3) individual support for public policies.
