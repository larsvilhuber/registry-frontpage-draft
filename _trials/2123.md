abstract: "Lebanon, a nation of approximately 4 million citizens, is now sheltering more than 1 million registered Syrian refugees, approximately half of whom are Syrian children between the ages of 3 and 18. This study investigates the impact of Healing Classrooms Tutoring and low-cost targeted social-emotional interventions  for the school-aged Syrian refugee population in the Bekaa and Akkar regions of Lebanon.

In Fall 2016, we will randomize sites, defined as informal tent settlements and/or buildings serving 1-3 informal tent settlements, stratified by region: (1) no tutoring support/wait-list (K = 21); (2) Healing Classrooms Tutoring Basic (K = 33); and (3) Healing Classrooms Tutoring Mindfulness (K=33). In Spring 2017, half of sites will continue providing Healing Classrooms Tutoring Basic while half of sites will provide Healing Classrooms Tutoring Brain Games. 

In 2017-18, IRC will deliver programming to 57 program sites, stratified by region and prior year's treatment status. They will be randomized to two treatment arms: Healing Classrooms Tutoring basic (K =28) or Healing Classrooms Tutoring 5-component SEL curriculum (K =29)"
