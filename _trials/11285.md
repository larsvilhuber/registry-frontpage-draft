abstract: "In this project, we collect data on expected personal and household benefits to migration and on migration intentions among a sample of jobseekers in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We also integrate a survey experiment to understand how migration intentions may be shaped by a potential migrantâ€™s expected personal and household benefits of migrating. "
