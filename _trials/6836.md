abstract: "We utilize the trust game to investigate in an online experiment whether trustees (receivers) who send money back are rather motivated by positive feelings such as warm glow or by avoiding negative feelings such as guilt. In the trust game itself, distinguishing between altruism and guilt aversion is senseless as both higher levels of altruism and higher levels of guilt aversion motivate the receiver to return higher amounts. However, distinguishing between the two kinds of motivations is important when receivers can opt out from the trust game. Specifically, we have developed a behavioral game theoretic model that yields the following main result: If reciprocal behavior is motivated by guilt aversion (warm glow), then those who return higher amounts have a higher (lower) incentive to opt out. Distinguishing between warm glow and guilt aversion is hence important to understand if and why subjects who self-select or who are randomly assigned to situations where trust matters behave more or less trustworthy. A pilot with 200 subjects suggests that reciprocity seems to be motivated by positive emotions (warm glow) rather than by avoiding negative emotions (guilt)."
