abstract: "This field experiment employs a two-stage design to study the selection and treatment effects of recognition benchmarked against money. The context is a large online crowdsourcing platform where knowledge workers engage in coding challenges. The incentives consist in a fixed wage and a recognition (awards) treatment, both of which are dependent on completion but not on performance. "
