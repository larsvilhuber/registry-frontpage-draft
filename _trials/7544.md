abstract: "Emerging evidence suggests that work and movement restrictions, isolation, and fear of disease associated with the current pandemic are taking an emotional toll on wellbeing and work performance. I consider a strategy for improving wellbeing by broadening access to proven app-based mental health treatment. I hypothesize that use of a mental health app can improve emotional wellbeing and work productivity in the general population. I have designed a randomized controlled trial to test this hypothesis with the general American population."
