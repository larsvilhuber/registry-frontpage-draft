abstract: "Prepaid water and electricity meters offer a promising solution to lumpy and unpredictable bills by allowing customers to choose the timing and quantity of purchases. At the same time, prepayment circumvents debt accumulation, allowing utility companies to serve otherwise high-cost customers. Researchers will collaborate with the municipal utility in Cape Town, South Africa to evaluate customer responses and revenue recovery for prepaid versus credit electricity metering. The study generates new evidence on the impacts of prepaid meters on energy use and revenue recovery using a randomized phase-in of new prepaid customers.  Researchers will explore how prepaid meters change the customer experience and the municipalityâ€™s revenue recovery."
