abstract: "In this experimental study, we examine the role of worker reciprocity—the tendency to reward kindness and punish unkindness—as a driving factor behind firms' investment in general training that benefits not only themselves but also other firms in the industry. Specifically, the experiment is designed to disentangle the effects of intention-based reciprocity from those of distributional preferences in explaining this behavior. We employ a two-by-two design to investigate workers' responses to both intentional and randomly assigned training levels, assessing the impact of intention-based reciprocity. Simultaneously, the design varies to allow for either positive or negative reciprocation towards the employer through unobservable efforts.
