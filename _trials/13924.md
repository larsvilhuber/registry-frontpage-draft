abstract: "We conducted a laboratory experiment to study how deliberation affects interpersonal projection bias. Using a real-effort experiment, we demonstrated that people project their current tastes onto others when forecasting others' behavior, even when their tastes are exogenously manipulated and transparently different. The influence of deliberation on prediction depends on the state at the time of prediction. Additionally, deliberation from experience can be considered either noise or a help for rational prediction, warranting further study."
