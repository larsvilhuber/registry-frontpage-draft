abstract: "A foundational result in behavioral economics is that decision-makers treat losses differently than gains. Until now, this difference has largely been hypothesized to be driven by an underlying “loss aversion” value function (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979). We hypothesize that losses may also focus decision-makers more effectively than gains, causing them to expend more cognitive effort. "
