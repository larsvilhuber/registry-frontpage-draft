abstract: "We implement a survey experiment among tenants in Shelby County/Memphis, TN who applied for its Emergency Rental and Utilities Assistance program. The survey experiment measures attitudes toward landlords, beliefs about eviction, and interest in informal negotiation with landlords. It also studies whether providing truthful information about landlords can affect tenant beliefs and negotiation behavior. "
