abstract: "The attractiveness for doing business has been shown to correlate closely with economic growth, but little is known about the extent to which the attractiveness of locations causally impacts investment decisions of firms. We design a survey experiment using a high-quality sample of managers having leadership positions at German firms to identify the causal effect of the attractiveness of firm locations on investment decisions of top managers. We exogenously shift managers' assessments about the attractiveness of Germany as a business location by informing a randomly chosen subset of managers about positive or negative expert assessments. Those assessments were previously elicited in a large-scale expert survey on global business locations. We use the causal shift of manager perceptions as a first stage, and then measure the causal effect of this shift on investment decisions in a second stage. Our results will deliver important policy implications, helping to quantify the extent to which business locations impact firm decisions. "
