abstract: "Ghanaians in rural, poor and difficult to reach communities face major disparities when it comes to access to electricity: 27% of households lack access, five times higher than rates in urban areas. Ghana launched the Solar Lantern Promotion Program (SLPP) in 2013 to increase access to modern, affordable, and dependable energy services by replacing kerosene lanterns with solar lanterns. Consequently, expanding the SLPP’s subsidy model to meet the distribution goals for 2030 must begin with an evaluation of beneficiaries’ willingness to pay for solar lanterns. However, research on willingness to pay for solar lanterns, and the effects of sensitization and favorable payment options, remains limited. 

This project seeks to answer the following questions: 1. How much are Ghanaians in targeted communities willing to pay for solar lanterns? 2. How is willingness to pay affected by: a) financial and health sensitization and b) flexible payment ?The population of interest will be rural households in northern Ghana who are not connected to the national grid. The Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) bidding mechanism will be used to elicit WTP. To estimate the willingness to pay level of Ghanaians for solar lanterns, the mean and median WTP will be evaluated using descriptive statistics analysis. We will use multivariate regression to evaluate the impact of the interventions on households’ willingness to pay for solar lantern. "
