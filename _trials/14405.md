abstract: "The underrepresentation of women in politics is a serious concern throughout the world. Official data from the Inter-Parliamentary Union (an international organization of national parliaments of 179 countries) show that the global participation rate of women in national-level parliaments is 26.4%, and only 5 countries have 50% or more of seats in the lower house occupied by women. 

Brazil, one of the largest democracies in the world and the site of this project, is no exception. Currently, women occupy only 14.8% of the seats in the lower house of the Brazilian Congress. Moreover, 955 out of 5,565 municipalities did not elect a single woman to their local chamber in the last election, thus leaving over 10.2 million Brazilian women without political representation at the local level.

The goal of this project is to study the demand-side factors that affect voting for female candidates in Brazil. Most standard voting models assume that voters evaluate candidates along several dimensions when deciding for whom to vote. These dimensions often include the candidate’s Gender, their perceived Ability, and their Policy positions, (GAP).  Based on these three dimensions, we have developed a statistical model to decouple their effects on voting decisions. Importantly, our framework can separately identify the roles of preferences versus beliefs of individual voters in this multidimensional decision. A key empirical contribution of this work will be its ability to disentangle which dimensions matter the most for voters when choosing a candidate and how gender (both of the candidate and of the voter) plays a role in this choice. Campaigns to promote gender representation require a clear understanding of the roots of underrepresentation to be effective.

To estimate our model, we have designed a randomized control trial (RCT) that exploits Instagram’s capabilities to micro-target individual voters with messages in the form of ads. The use of the Instagram platform is an exciting feature of the project, as it has become commonly used by political parties for their own political campaigning. As we describe in more detail below, our experiment will consist of several gender-specific treatments that will vary in their level of informativeness. This distinction in informativeness across messages is key for not only isolating changes in salience and beliefs about a particular candidate’s dimension (e.g., gender, ability, and policy), but it will also allow us to recover any learning effects on the voter side without relying on survey-based methods. We will run our experiment in the weeks just prior to this year’s October elections in Brazil, at a geographical scale sufficiently large to detect effects on aggregate vote shares.
