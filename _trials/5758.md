abstract: "This study consists of a single randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to assess whether Russia’s ongoing constitutional reform is generating rally effects for Vladimir Putin (and secondarily governors) at the time when a national vote on the amendments was originally scheduled to be held (it has been postponed to an as-yet undefined future date). It is conducted as part of a nationally representative telephone survey of about 1600 adult residents of Russia in late April 2020."
