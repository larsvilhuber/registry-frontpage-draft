abstract: "This paper aims to examine the connections between climate change and social tension, and how they may affect individual climate policy acceptance and climate action. Specifically, we examine individual agreement with transport policy measures aimed at improving the sustainability of individualized passenger transport, and the collective action of lobbying for policy change, specifically writing an email to politicians expressing support or refusal for certain climate policies. To induce perceived social tension in a controlled manner in a large survey experiment including 3,000 participants. As loneliness, an emerging issue in Western societies can affect how people perceive social tension, we furthermore examine whether the effect of perceived social tension on policy agreement and lobbying for policy change is moderated by it."
