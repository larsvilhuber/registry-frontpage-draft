abstract: "Abstract The present document outlines an analysis we plan to conduct using data generated from Haushofer and Shapiro's (2013) evaluation of the GiveDirectly unconditional cash transfers program taking place from 2011-2013. In particular, we will exploit random variation in the degree to which the program shifted the relative wealth of women versus men in the villages observed as part of the study. We will use this measures as a proxy variable to causally identify shifts in the relative economics status of women in a community on a number of outcomes, holding constant changes in the relative status of women within each household. We also propose several dimensions of heterogeneity that we suspect will be the primary driver of the effects. We propose to evaluate outcomes including the proportion of household consumption allocated to certain categories; differences in educational attainment, educational aspirations, hours worked, and measures of nutrition and health between female and male children; participation of adult females in the labor market and entrepreneurial activities; joint and individual ownership of savings and assets; women's empowerment; and fertility decisions.
