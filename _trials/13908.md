abstract: "Rates of developmental delay remain high among young children in many low- and middle-income countries. One effective way to promote early childhood development in these settings is through programs in which trainers visit caregivers in the home and teach them activities and skills to stimulate their child’s development. However, such programs have typically been costly and difficult to expand across wide areas or large populations. This study, conducted in rural China, seeks to determine if delivering the trainings partially through a specially designed digital app can increase the scalability of a parenting training program without compromising its effectiveness.

What does the study involve?
The study will be undertaken in 80 villages in three rural counties in a province in central China. Participants are children aged between 6 and 24 months at the time of the survey, as well as their caregivers. Caregivers in 40 villages will receive trainings for one year, with the first two months of trainings occurring in person, and the next ten months occurring over the app (with in-person visits every two months to check in). Caregivers in the other 40 villages will not receive any trainings and will serve as the control group. The primary outcome will be early childhood development. Secondary outcomes will include caregiver mental health, caregivers’ usage and attitudes toward digital programs, caregivers’ attitudes and feelings about parenting, and the amount of time and resources that caregivers put into stimulating their child’s development. 

This research will generate rigorous evidence on the impact of government-administered ECD programs on child psychosocial stimulation. The potential benefits of this study are improved cognitive and non-cognitive skills of children. If successful, the intervention will also offer broader insights that can inform future programs and policies to promote early childhood development at scale in rural China."
