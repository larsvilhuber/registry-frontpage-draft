abstract: "The aim of the experiment is to test the effectiveness of reputation mechanisms to promote cooperation in one-shot, anonymous interactions.
 In a sequential prisoner dilemma, we vary whether past behavior of the second mover is disclosed to the first mover. We also vary whether the disclosure is exogenous or endogenous (i.e. a choice by the second mover)."
