abstract: "Road accidents kill 1.3 million people each year, most in the developing world.  We test the efficacy of evocative messages, delivered on stickers placed inside Kenyan matatus, or minibuses, in reducing road accidents.  We randomize the intervention – which nudges passengers to complain to their drivers directly – across 12,000 vehicles.  We use insurance claims data and vehicle speeds to assess the impact of the interventions.  We also evaluate a complementary radio campaign aired during randomly selected weeks over a 5 month period.
