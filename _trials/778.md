abstract: "Physical pain is a common but largely overlooked aspect of the lives of the poor.  Not only does pain directly reduce life quality and happiness, it may also hamper cognitive function and, consequently, decision-making, productivity, and earnings. Workers with chronic pain may work fewer days, take longer breaks, and make less-considered choices regarding inputs; all outcomes that would reduce output and lead to greater impoverishment or impede the productivity and profitability of microenterprises and firms. We will take the first steps in understanding the broader causal impact of physical pain on the cognitive and economic lives of the poor via a randomized controlled trial (RCT). 450 low-income women in Chennai, India, will be assigned to one of three treatment arms: 600 mg of over-the-counter pain medication, a placebo pill, or no medication. The research will quantify the causal impact of reduced pain on previously unstudied outcomes essential to escaping poverty including cognitive function, productivity, and earnings."
