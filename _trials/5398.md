abstract: "We propose to examine whether the exposure of young men to military conscription can change their sexist attitudes and behaviors. To address potential endogeneity concerns we exploit the conscription draft in Argentina. We combine administrative data from the draft with data from a purposely-designed survey on sexist attitudes and behaviors."
