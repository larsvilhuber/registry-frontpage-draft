abstract: "Mental health problems and psychological distress are prevalent among displaced populations, and most adult Syrian refugees in urban areas of Jordan have symptoms of depression (Miguel et al., 2021). Yet mental health care-seeking in this setting is low. This project will investigate whether stigma may be a barrier to mental health care-seeking, by using a list experiment to estimate rates of discrimination against mental health care-seekers. The estimates of the list experiment will be compared both to directly elicited 2nd order beliefs and to the respondentâ€™s own directly elicited beliefs from a prior survey administered multiple months earlier. Heterogeneity analysis will be conducted comparing respondents who score above or below median on a short mental health questionnaire, and testing for differences by respondent gender. "
