abstract: "This small-scale pilot evaluates the roll out of Your Choice, an intervention designed by the London Violence Reduction Unit and the Association of London Directors of Children's Services, and developed in partnership with the Children and Adolescent Mental Health Service. Your Choice targets 11-17 year-olds entitled to public support for being at medium to high risk of harm or engagement in crime and violent behaviour. It aims to reduce violent and anti-social behaviour among them, by delivering an intensive schedule of meetings (three contacts per week for 12 weeks) with the youth workers coaching them, and by introducing elements of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) in their interactions. To that end, it provides specialist training in a range of CBT techniques to youth workers and clinical supervision of coaches through their delivery of the programme to the young people. This project will provide qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the pilot phase of the intervention, where the latter will use a randomized control trial methodology to assess the very short run impacts of the intervention on emotional and behavioural outcomes for young people."
