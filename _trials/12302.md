abstract: "Evidence shows that teachers interact differently with boys and girls, grade them differently and provide different feedback and career advice. These gendered teaching practices have signicant effects on boys' and girls' school achievement and educational choices, especially in scientic subjects where strong gender stereotypes prevail. However, little is known about the behavioral roots of such gendered practices. We rst develop a theoretical model to rationalize teachers' potential gendered behaviour. We then empirically test those mechanisms using an
online experiment with secondary education teachers from several subjects. Teachers are asked to evaluate ctitious school transcripts for which we randomly change the information displayed, namely the student's gender (to measure the extent of their gendered practices). Then, they are invited to play a set of gender-blind and gender-revealed dictator games (to measure gender identity) and to take an implicit  association test (to measure gender implicit biases). We outline the study design, the variables of interest, the empirical approach and the hypotheses to be tested."
