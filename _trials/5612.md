abstract: "We randomly assign economic undergraduate students to three treatment arms: control, information that highlights the personal benefits of social distancing, and information that highlights the externalities (i.e., benefits to others) by socially distancing. Using a pooled-cross sectional analysis, with anonymous survey data before and after receipt of the intervention, we test whether highlighting benefits increased social distancing, and whether information on personal benefits was more or less effective than information on externalities.
