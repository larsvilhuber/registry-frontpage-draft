abstract: "The growth of digital marketing platforms is changing the food system and presents an opportunity to address the problem of access to the output market among rural farmers. However, digital transformation is accompanied by a growing digital divide due to limited digital literacy and tools, which may hinder rural farmers from exploring opportunities in the digital market. We launch a digital literacy intervention and assess the relationship between digital literacy and market access. We also explore how digital literacy can spur the demand for digital marketing platforms in rural areas. We assess the impact of the digital literacy intervention using a Randomised Controlled Trial by clustering at the community level and focusing on 3513 farming households in Nigeria. We then test how basic digital skills and access to digital marketing support via local marketing agents can improve farmers' access to the output market. "
