abstract: "Many frontline workers make adjudicative decisions about individual citizens’ access to public benefits and services. The proposed study examines a subtle way whereby formal decision rules and regulations inform and shape decision-making. Drawing on the notion of choice architecture in behavioral economics, the study theorizes that formal decision rules and regulations define a particular default decision outcome, and that the frontline workers use that “default” as a heuristic when processing the available information on which to base their decision-making. Using data from a survey experiment design among 2,000 Danish citizens, we show how manipulation of the default decision outcome relates to decision-making about a citizen’s access to a public service.
