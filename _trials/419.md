abstract: "This pilot program will investigate factors behind low uptake of voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) in South Africa. We will conduct a randomized controlled field experiment in Gauteng. We will hand-deliver postcards with social marketing messages and/or vouchers to compensate for the opportunity costs associated with VMMC. By randomizing which households receive a particular message, voucher, or combination thereof and comparing uptake across these groups, we will be able to measure the relative effectiveness of each message and cash transfer in increasing uptake of VMMC."
