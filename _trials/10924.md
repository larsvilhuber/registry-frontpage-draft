abstract: "We study the effects of the Canadian Career Development Foundation (CCDF) program In Motion and Momentum Plus (IM&M+). The program
targets individuals who may have experienced repeated setbacks with respect to traditional learning and/or work and provides activities aiming to improve their pre-employability skills. We propose an analysis of the effectiveness of the program through a randomized control trial (RCT) looking at several outcomes, such as, pre-employability skills, education, employment, earnings, and others. We combine online surveys with government administrative data and perform a cost-benefit analysis. To evaluate the results of the RCT, we present a straightforward
econometric framework that accounts for multiple hypothesis testing."
