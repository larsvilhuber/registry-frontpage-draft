abstract: "The goal of this study is to understand how to help marginalized women in conflict-affected countries move from poverty and isolation to self-sufficiency and empowerment. More specifically, we want to test two hypotheses. (1) Whether providing knowledge, skills, and resources can increase women’s self-confidence and create sustainable change in their lives and those of their families and communities. (2) Whether the above intervention is more effective if we also help the women’s husbands or fathers reflect on women-centered issues, such as women’s health and socio-economic empowerment."
