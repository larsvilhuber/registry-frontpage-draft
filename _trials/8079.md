abstract: "Animal farming for the purpose of meat and dairy production, especially in the most prevalent intensive way, has significant environmental, health and ethical consequences, which are increasingly debated in politics and public. Apart from the fundamental question of eating animals, an increasing number of meat eaters questions under which conditions farming animals are reared.
Survey results show that farm animal welfare is important to a majority of consumers (BMEL 2021). These preferences are, however, not reflected in the market yet. From an economics perspective, animal welfare is a public good (Grethe 2017), leading to potential free-riding behavior and negative externalities for those agents who care about animals’ well-being (Harvey and Hubbard 2013; Lusk and Norwood 2011). Moreover, animal welfare is a credence attribute for consumers (Darby and Karni 1973) that cannot be verified after purchase or even after consumption. The resulting information asymmetry contributes to a failure of the market for animal welfare (Lusk et al. 2007). Even those consumers who are interested in contributing to the public good cannot do so because they lack information on the animal welfare conditions underlying the products. Labeling is an option to provide (additional) information to consumers (Teisl and Roe 1998), transferring improvements towards the social optimum to consumers. Improvements need to be accompanied by a higher willingness to pay (WTP) for better animal welfare conditions. 
The German government plans to introduce a state animal welfare label ("Tierwohlkennzeichen") for fresh meat products for which farmers can voluntarily apply if they rear their farm animals under better animal welfare conditions than the ones defined by legal minimum standard (BMEL 2020). The label is supposed to consist of three levels and 13 criteria that have to be fulfilled for each level are already defined. Three research questions arise from this political and public discourse.

Research on labeling certain aspects of husbandry conditions and on fictitious animal welfare labels finds a positive WTP for labeled meat products in choice and contingent valuation experiments (e.g., Carlsson et al. 2020; Yang and Renwick 2019; Clark et al. 2017; Gracia and de-Magistris 2016; Janssen et al. 2016; van Loo et al. 2014; Koistinen et al. 2013). Most of the studies, however, test a fictional label or husbandry criteria that researchers picked themselves as opposed to an actually planned state label with its specifics. The first research question is thus: Are consumers willing to pay for a German state animal welfare label with all its complexities compared to no label?

In addition, only fresh meat is planned to be labeled, although processed meat products, such as sausages or bacon, account for half of the average meat consumption per person in Germany (DFV 2020). Hence, the second research question is: Does the WTP for the label differ depending on product type, i. e. whether it is provided for fresh or processed meat?

On top of the labeling, policy makers discuss how to finance the transformation in the farming sector towards higher animal welfare standards. The most favored option so far has been to introduce an additional consumption tax for meat products, a so called animal welfare tax (“Tierwohlabgabe”; Kompetenznetzwerk Nutztierhaltung 2020). The tax is supposed to be collected on every kilogram of meat sold (0.40 EUR/kg) independent from the type of meat and animal welfare conditions under which the meat has been produced. Earnings from the tax are planned to be redistributed to farmers who implement higher animal welfare standards. As a result, every meat buyer would contribute at least a little towards animal welfare and every consumer knows that others are contributing, too. The potential free-riding behavior resulting from animal welfare’s public good character might thereby be influenced. To our knowledge, the interaction between an informational and a tax instrument in the context of animal welfare has not been researched yet. These considerations lead to the third research question: Does the introduction of an additional animal welfare consumption tax change the WTP for the state animal welfare label?"
