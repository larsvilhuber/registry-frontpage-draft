abstract: "We conduct a national audit field experiment to quantify sexual orientation discrimination in access to mortgages. We focus on mortgage loan originators (MLOs), who help prospective borrowers get the right mortgage, working with the borrower from application and approval through the closing process (it can be a lending company, mortgage broker or loan officer). Discrimination by MLOs could lead to reduced access to mortgage loans and/or delays, lower loan amounts, or worse terms.
This research examines how mortgage loan originators (MLOs) respond to on-average identical emails inquiring about mortgage loans from different-gender or same-gender married couples. We ask two research questions: Do mortgage loan originators (MLOs) discriminate against credit-worthy individuals based on their sexual orientation? And What mechanisms drive potential differences in response rates to same and different-sex couples by MLOs?
