abstract: "This study employs a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in order to improve our understanding of how a pandemic crisis can shape both national identity and the political consequences of national identity. It is conducted as part of a nationally representative telephone survey of 2000 adult residents of Ukraine in mid-April 2000, early in the COVID-19 outbreak. The study has three dimensions. First, it primes randomly assigned individuals on the pandemic crisis generally (including its economic, personal, and policy dimensions) and assesses whether this priming is associated with a change in what respondents say is the most important criterion for being a Ukrainian. Second, it treats another set of randomly selected respondents with a frame that explicitly contextualizes the virus threat in national terms, allowing us to investigate whether and how this national framing is associated with a change in what respondents say is the most important criterion for being a Ukrainian. Third, we investigate the political consequences of framing the pandemic crisis in national terms, assessing whether priming people on the national threat posed by the virus produces an increase in political support (in the form of job approval ratings) for Ukraineâ€™s leadership relative to priming on the virus alone."
