abstract: "We evaluate the impact of an in-school math tutoring program in a charter middle school in Indiana. The population served by this school is low-income, with 97% receiving free or reduced-price lunch. Students are randomly assigned to receive either 1) No Tutoring, 2) Tutoring two times per week in a two-student group, or 3) Tutoring three times per week in a three-student group. The tutoring cost is the same ($40 per week per student) in both tutoring treatment arms. Our primary hypothesis is that tutoring of either type will improve end-of-year math assessment scores relative to the control condition. "
