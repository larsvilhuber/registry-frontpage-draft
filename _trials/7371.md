abstract: "As communication has increasingly moved online, so have political conversations. In India, where the expansion of mobile internet access has been accompanied by the rise of social media, the relationship between social media and electoral outcomes is of particular interest. Yet little is known about the causal impact of social media on voters. Using an online field experiment, I will evaluate the impact of political groups on WhatsApp in the context of statewide election in Tamil Nadu, India. These groups are organized by political parties. Group members receive curated posts directly from party members, but are also able to post their own content to the groups and interact with each other. I will offer subjects an invitation link to a political WhatsApp group for their voting constituency, randomizing which of the two major political parties the assigned group is affiliated with. Conditional on clicking the hyperlink, I will further randomize subjects into one of three conditions: (1) a real group organized by the assigned party; (2) a broadcast-only group that mirrors the real group but where only official party content is forwarded but group members cannot post themselves; (3) a control, where upon clicking the link participants are redirected to a final survey page. Approximately 3-4 weeks later, I will resurvey participants, measuring political attitudes and beliefs. Conditions (1) and (3) provide an estimate of the treatment effect of the groups, while condition (2) allows me to parse the impact of the social interaction between group members relative to the official party messaging."
