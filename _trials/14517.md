abstract: "We conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Switzerland to study the social and economic consequences of legalizing access to cannabis for recreational use. We are interested in how legal access to cannabis affects usersâ€™ social and economic well-being, involvement in criminal activities, and drug use patterns. We also evaluate the effects of a self-regulation program to prevent excessive cannabis consumption."
