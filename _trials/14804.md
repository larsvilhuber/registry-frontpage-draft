abstract: "Despite high rates of mental health challenges such as depression and anxiety and the availability of effective treatment options, most university students do not seek professional help. This project examines the factors that shape the demand for mental health services among students, as well as the barriers that prevent them from seeking support. We conduct a representative survey at a large university in Mexico to establish baseline information on student mental health. Preliminary results indicate that nearly one-third of students report moderate or severe symptoms of depression and anxiety, yet most do not seek or receive adequate support, with only 40% of students in distress accessing professional help. Additionally, while students tend to believe that poor mental health correlates with lower grades, our data shows no evidence to support this. Our findings aim to inform interventions to reduce the mental health treatment gap in the university student population."
