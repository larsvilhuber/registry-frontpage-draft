abstract: "This study aims to better understand how women make labor adjustments in terms of family organization and well-being. To study this, we build on a previous field experiment among female teachers with children in Switzerland where we randomly informed women about the future long-term financial consequences of having a reduced workload. The goal of this survey wave is to collect qualitative data to understand changes in family logistics and satisfaction, approximately 18 months after the original intervention. More information about the original study design can be found here: https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/10399."
