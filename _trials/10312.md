abstract: "The research team is partnering with the Goodwill Excel Center, a network of tuition-free charter high schools for adults, to evaluate a new intervention for students with prior involvement with the criminal justice system.  The GEI Recidivism intervention provides comprehensive recidivism reduction services to students through in-class and one-on-one mentoring. Each term, all Excel Center students will be screened for prior involvement with the criminal justice system, defined as either having a guilty, deferred or diverted charge in the state of IN or having a previous jail booking in Marion County. Those found to have a prior charge or booking will be randomly assigned to either a treatment or control group. Those in the treatment group will be offered coaching from a justice-involved coach and be eventually enrolled in a justice-involved senior seminar when they become academically eligible. All of these services are in addition to standard support provided by the Excel Center. The control group will receive business as usual support from the Excel Center and take the regular senior seminar. Approximately 800 students will be randomized between treatment and control, across 15 school terms (3 years) in 4 school Excel Center locations. The research team will assess the impact of the recidivism intervention on Excel Center persistence and completion, recidivism, post-secondary success, earnings, and employment.
