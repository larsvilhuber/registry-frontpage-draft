abstract: "Blanket fertilizer recommendations are often used in developing countries to encourage farmers to use particular blends of fertilizer. The response to these recommendations has been poor among smallholder farmers. Using a randomized control trial, we explore whether targeted extension advice leads farmers to align fertilizer usage to the recommended levels and whether this impacts productivity. We also consider whether coupling the targeted information with agricultural insurance to protect fertilizer investments in the event of crop failure enhances adoption rates. Results show that targeted recommendations closed the gap between the amount of fertilizer used and the recommended amounts and that this in turn led to increased productivity. We found no differential effect of the targeted recommendation when coupled with agricultural insurance suggesting that the risk of crop failure is not a binding constraint to fertilizer adoption in this context, or that farmers do not consider agricultural insurance a useful risk-mitigating mechanism."
