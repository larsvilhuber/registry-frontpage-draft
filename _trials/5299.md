abstract: "We conduct our field experiment within primary school classrooms where a pair of deskmates forms the smallest possible designated peer group. We randomize the seats to ensure that every student has a randomized deskmate. We further measure the non-cognitive peer difference between a pair of deskmates, and we record their mid-term and final grades."
