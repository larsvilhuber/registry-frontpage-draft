abstract: "In partnership with one of the worldâ€™s largest garment manufacturers with production based in Bengaluru, India, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial to study the drivers and consequences of internal migration of women in rural India. We will randomly select locations for 10 large rural tailor training centers among 20 candidate village clusters (taluks) representing roughly 1220 villages in rural Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Once the rural tailor training facilities are established in each of the 10 randomly chosen taluks, women in nearby villages will be offered free vocational skill training in stitching. Training will occur in roughly 6-7 batches of 30 workers per center per year and trainees will be offered guaranteed employment at the partner firm in Bengaluru upon the completion of 3 months of training. Mobilization and recruitment for the training batches is mandated by the government skilling subsidy scheme to be targeted towards households with working-age females that are below the poverty line (BPL) and, when possible, represent marginalized ethnicities (scheduled castes and tribes). 
We have sampled 240 villages from the 1220 villages within a 20km radius of the 20 candidate taluks, and 12 households from each of the 240 sampled villages, of which 9 in each village are targeted households most eligible for the program and 3 are non-targeted households. Sample weights allow us to recover representative measures at the village economy level, as well as for subsamples of targeted and non-targeted households. A baseline survey of these 2880 households representing roughly 2912 eligible women is currently under way. Follow up surveys will track work and welfare outcomes of these women every 6 months and household consumption, investment, and economic activities every 12 months for a period of 3 years after the baseline survey."
