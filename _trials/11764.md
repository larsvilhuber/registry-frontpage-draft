abstract: "This study will generate new insights into the gender gap in expert opinions (men’s greater willingness to give their opinions) by shedding light on the “demand side” of the market for expertise. Specifically, it will test whether male and female experts have a different influence on the opinions of members of the public. 
Previous studies have found a gender gap in willingness to give opinions among members of the general public (asked to give opinions on the answers to general knowledge questions, Coffman, 2020) and among groups of academic experts (asked to give opinions on topical economic policy questions, Sievertsen and Smith, 2022). This arises because men are more confident (more certain) about their opinions. 
This gender gap in confidence in opinions may be innate or result from individuals’ strategic behaviour (Benabou, 2015). These are both “supply-side explanations”. On the demand-side, men may be more confident in their opinions because those opinions are more positively received (eg because of a stereotype of male expertise). A recent study found that people were more likely to seek a second medical opinion when the first opinion was given by a female rather than a male doctor (De Vaan and Stuart, 2022).
This study will test this idea formally by comparing the influence of male and female experts on the opinions formed by members of the public on a set of topical economic policy issues. "
