abstract: "
Introduction:
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) account for 74% of all deaths globally and physical inactivity is among the leading factors contributing to this global burden of disease (WHO, 2023; Ezzati et al 2006). In the UK, over 25% of adults fall below recommended activity levels, intensifying NCD prevalence and straining healthcare. Traditional approaches have focused on medical care delivery to people with an established disease. Instead, emerging research in the fields of behavioural economics is exploring new strategies to avoid the development of NCDs by encouraging individuals to adopt and maintain healthy lifestyles, including regular physical activity (PA). Various studies have shown that reminders, personalized goal-setting, and social reinforcement can boost PA, but it is hard to determine the relative effects of these interventions against each other.

Mega studies, which are randomised experiments testing multiple interventions offer the possibility to test simultaneously the impact of alternative interventions on the same outcomes in a defined population. This study introduces a mega study testing five interventions, aiming to foster regular PA among inactive individuals. Focused on a single population and outcome measure, our objective is actionable insights for evidence-based strategies to cultivate sustainable PA habits, significantly contributing to shaping public health initiatives.

Objectives:
Glean insights into nudging PA behaviour change within Vitality UK's member population, identifying effective strategies for lasting changes in PA behaviours and habits.

Methods:
A mega study involving 60,000 Vitality members compares five four-week digital programs encouraging exercise. Inclusion criteria encompass Vitality health insurance membership, opting into the rewards program, and prior engagement with a baseline incentive program. The study includes one control (simple reminder) and four treatment groups, testing distinct nudges (personalized reminder, loss aversion, authority, and resolution/fresh start). Utilizing a comprehensive dataset, including objective and biometrically verified data distinguishes it from traditional survey-based studies.

Results:
Ongoing analysis will include the effect of each nudge on PA levels compared to baseline. Subgroup analyses based on demographics and baseline PA levels will be undertaken.

Discussion:
Analysing the mega study's nuanced findings will assess intervention effectiveness, implications for intrinsic motivation, and behaviour change sustainability. Broader considerations for public health policies and interventions in combating the global burden of disease associated with physical inactivity will be explored.
