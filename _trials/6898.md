abstract: "This randomized controlled trial will analyze the effectiveness of a package of productive inclusion measures to support livelihoods among households participating in the cash transfer component of the Chad Safety Nets Project. The objective of the study is to (i) evaluate the
impact of productive accompanying measures on cash transfer beneficaries; (ii) and test whether the intervention generates local spill-overs.

The study is a spin-off of a ongoing multi-country RCT embedded in the Sahel Adaptive Social Protection Program (https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/2544). It will complement evidence from other countries by analyzing the effectiveness of a multi-faceted support package (including facilitation of savings groups, micro-entrepreneurship training, a lump-sum cash grant and coaching), as well as by documenting local spill-overs."
