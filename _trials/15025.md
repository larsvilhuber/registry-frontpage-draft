abstract: "This project investigates gender bias in small business microfinance lending through a framed experiment conducted in Egypt. Loan officers evaluate previously approved loans with randomized applicant names. By comparing whether the same portfolios are rejected more frequently with names suggesting different genders, the study aims to identify the existence of bias. Additionally, the project explores the origins of this bias, examining whether it is inclusionary or exclusionary errors. It also investigates whether the amount of bias varies based on the incentive structure that loan officers face. The project seeks to determine how such bias might be mitigated. For example, it tests whether sensitivity training, AI-assisted decision-making, or higher incentives and penalties for incorrect decisions have a positive impact or not.
