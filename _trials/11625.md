abstract: "The purpose of the study is to measure U.S. citizensâ€™ attitudes and political behavior after Supreme Court decisions. Using survey experiments, we will provide causal evidence on whether arguments presented in judicial opinions change public opinion on various issues and the acceptance of the decisions and legitimacy of the court.
