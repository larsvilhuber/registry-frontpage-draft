abstract: "Are inert consumers aware of their future inertia? To answer this we run a field experiment that offers two million readers of a European newspaper auto-renewing or auto-canceling contracts. We find consumers are inert yet anticipate and account for their inertia: offering auto-renewing contracts lowers subscriptions by 24% and reduces subscribers by 10% over two years; most of the inert readers preempt inertia. Consumers' inertia impact on market outcomes depends on consumersâ€™ overall awareness of it, which is often ignored by the literature, firms, and policy makers. In our context, consumer sophistication limits the firm from exploiting their behavioral limitations."
