abstract: "To date, there is scarce evidence about how providers respond to insurance schemes in low- and middle-income countries. We design an experimental audit study in Ghana to answer two questions: (1) to what extent do providers in public primary health centres treat differently patients who are insured in the national health insurance scheme, compared to those who are not? (2) is there evidence of fraudulent behaviour? Unbeknownst to the consulting providers, we send two pairs of standardized patients to pass as patients in 120 health centres. Within a pair, the two SPs are matched on gender and trained to present the same clinical condition to the same facilities. For each facility visited by a pair of SP, we randomly choose which one presents their national health insurance card and which one does not. We look at the effect of insurance cover on cost, quality and efficiency outcomes. Subject to being able to link the SP visit to claims data, we will also look at the prevalence of a range of fraudulent behaviours."
