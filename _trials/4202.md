abstract: "This study employs a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the economic impacts of deworming goats in India. The primary research question is: if cost effective healthcare practices like deworming have a positive impact on goat health, to what extent do we see an improvement in economic outcomes for goat keepers? We explore this research question in the context of predominantly tribal goat owners in Munger, Bihar (India), for whom livestock is the primary source of income. Subsequently, we hope to analyse if research-based evidence can incentivize higher adoption of the deworming pills in the treated households as well as in their social networks."
