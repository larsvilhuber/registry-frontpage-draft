abstract: "Given the current technologies, misinformation spreads around the globe at a speed faster than ever before. Once misinformation starts to propagate, it is difficult to counteract. Numerous psychological experiments have shown that displacing misinformation is challenging even in controlled lab settings (Lewandowsky et al., 2012). In this project, we instead aim to ``inoculate'' people against misinformation through teaching them how to identify and avoid sharing misinformation. In collaboration with the non-profit organization First Draft News, we developed a text message based course to inoculate people against misinformation and test its effects on sharing behavior through a survey-based field experiment in Kenya.
