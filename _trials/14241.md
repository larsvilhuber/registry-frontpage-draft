abstract: "In previous decades of rising economic inequality, the developed world saw various local, regional, and even national governments enact living wage policies to increase wages for those at the bottom of the income ladder. More recently, other government programs are testing universal basic income (UBI) payment to fight poverty. Both a living wage and UBI will require public support for plausible implementation, and both are forms of redistribution that donâ€™t rely on means tested welfare benefits. Political and economic literature suggests the framing and numeric anchoring of a policy can influence public preferences, and even a policy proposal frame can shape individual preferences for adjacent policies. This raises the question of how a living wage frame, and a higher minimum wage monetary anchor, affects support for the wage floor and other forms of redistribution, such as UBI. We posit a wage floor frame and anchor, the name and a proposed hourly wage respectively, can influence public attitudes. Furthermore, we hypothesize that a large monetary increase in the wage floor will reduce support for other economic redistribution policies, including UBI.  A randomized choice experiment will test these theories by assigning American respondents to different informational treatments.  Additionally, we will use Quadratic Voting to measure the intensity of preferences. Our experimental design allows us to estimate the causal effects of framing and anchoring on public attitudes toward the wage floor, as well as the spillover effects on public support for UBI and other redistributive policies.
