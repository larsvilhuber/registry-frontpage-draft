abstract: "We suggest and examine a behavioral approach to increase seasonal influenza vaccine uptake based on the behavioral phenomenon known as the attraction effect. Using the seasonal nature of the flu, we present participants in a hypothetical survey with two options to receive the shot: early in the season, which is recommended and hence ``attractive'', or later. Three additional layers along which the early shot outperforms the late one are to be examined. We will compare intentions to get vaccinated when facing these options to those of a control who will be invited to get the shot regardless of timing."
