abstract: "We use the 2021 referendum in Taiwan as the background to see how people will update their voting decision after receiving the new information. We randomly assign the information articles about the referendum to the subjects, which can be supporting, opposing, or neutral to the propositions voted. We want to examine whether the "first vote" can change how people update beliefs and political decisions."
