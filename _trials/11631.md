abstract: "Agriculture is a risky proposition. One of the risks faced by agricultural producers is the risk that sale negotiations do not result in a trade (negotiation failure risk). The current shift in agricultural markets away from auction settings to more privately negotiated contracting exacerbates this risk. Yet, relatively little is known about how this risk may impact market outcomes. Moreover, Expected Utility Theory fails to explain why buyers have been found to have higher earnings than sellers, and why men have higher earnings than women, in privately negotiated experimental market studies. This study augments a Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) lottery survey to include negotiation failure risk in order to explore whether the broader CPT framework may help explain these prior experimental findings, and how potential loss in the context of negotiation failure may impact outcomes. Study participants were presented with a series of lotteries framed in a private negotiation context to measure factors that likely influence their decisions in this bargaining environment, including levels of risk and loss aversion. Half of the participants also took part in a market experiment prior to the lottery survey in order to determine whether prior market experience affects the values of these CPT characteristics. Findings indicate that CPT does indeed help explain differences in negotiating behavior and outcomes during private negotiations between buyers and sellers, and between men and women. Specifically, sellers and women have higher levels of loss aversion than buyers and men, respectively. Further, individuals with high levels of loss aversion have lower market earnings, potentially explaining several anomalies found in previous studies. Moreover, we find that individual decisions under risk are context-dependent, suggesting opportunities for agricultural producers (who generally self-identify as sellers), and especially women, to improve bargaining outcomes."
