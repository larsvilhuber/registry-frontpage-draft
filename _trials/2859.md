abstract: "From a traditional rational choice perspective, coalitions are inherently unstable if the collective decision involves some kind of distributional conflict. While traditional explanations for the stability of coalitions refer to institutions, more recent theoretical developments argue that behavioral traits like actors' prosociality and rationality have important effects. The aim of this project is to provide a first empirical test of this theoretical claim. In laboratory experiments, we first gather information on subjects' prosociality and rationality. Then subjects are matched into three-person groups based on their revealed behavior in the previous part of the experiment and then play a coalition formation game in continuous time."
