abstract: "Understanding moral behavior in different market contexts and the effect of such behavior on giving. We consider the dynamics of moral decision making. Individuals may change their moral stands over a sequence of choices. Specifically, they have a choice between two technologies when conducting a real-effort task, with one giving a higher personal return, but a smaller social payoff (reduces a donation pool). Following the real effort task, subjects can donate under varying information and competition conditions. We are interested in learning to what extent these conditions affect (i) the initial choice of the technology, and (ii) the subsequent donation decisions.
We add to the literature on mora behavior in markets. We provide a more realistic experimental environment that is inspired by charitable giving, e.g. via foundations, that often follows market activities that generate private incomes (fortunes), but may have had negative externalities. By varying the observability of individual actions as well as by varying the competitiveness in the initial money-earning stage, we are able to identify the underlying motivational mechanisms that govern moral/immoral behavior.
