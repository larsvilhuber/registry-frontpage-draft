abstract: "This study assesses how people's food choices differ under cognitive load, time pressure, and different type of information (subjective vs objective). We provide either objective (nutrition facts) or subjective information (future weight-gain and weight-loss pictures) when subjects are making food choices. Subjects go through 12 food choices rounds; in each round they are asked to choose between a normal product and its diet version.
