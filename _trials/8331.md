abstract: "We survey 1,000-1,500 adult citizens, the universe of first-level subnational legislators, and the universe of national legislators in Brazil, Colombia, Italy, and Pakistan to study their views about corruption. Using vignettes, we probe the trade-offs they think politicians should and would make between efficiency and corruption and between equity and corruption. We also solicit views about how corrupt politicians are believed to be. Sending the same survey to citizens and elected legislators allows us to explore how their views differ.
The survey also has two experimental components. The first, present for both for citizens and legislators, studies the willingness to waste money and/or engage in a trivial lie in order to obtain an ego-rent (in this case, a certificate reporting a substantial donation on behalf of the respondent to a charity of his or her choice). The second, only present in the legislator survey, studies how likely legislators are to change their views on corruption and to pledge their support for anti-corruption policies after they have been informed about citizensâ€™ views on the topic.
