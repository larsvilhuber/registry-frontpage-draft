abstract: "	Many begin their work lives with a part-time job while in school. These jobs may play a critical role in shaping preferences over work and helping youth navigate the school-to-work transition. However, little is known regarding the job features that appeal to student workers. We partner with a large state university to recruit its students for real jobs. We randomize over 47,000 students to receive emails which vary information about wages, required work hours per week, and schedule flexibility. To measure studentsâ€™ responses to this information, we track their real job applications and their pre-application job interest using their activity on the recruitment website. We pair this with a survey regarding their preferences over jobs. Responses to survey vignettes indicate that students' reservation wages are significantly lower for jobs which offer more flexibility. Moreover, reservation wages are significantly lower for employers which laid off a fewer fraction of students during the Covid-19 pandemic. Lastly, they are significantly lower for employers which prioritized students' financial needs over their productivity in choosing who to retain during pandemic-induced mass layoffs."
