abstract: "This study examines the impact of within-class differentiation on the learning outcomes of Flemish students in eighth and ninth grade. In particular, using a computer-based learning environment, we evaluate the impact of two differentiation practices on the effectiveness of a financial education programme. First, differentiating instructions to the particular needs of students is examined for which high-ability students follow a more challenging learning path and low-ability students a basic path with additional instructions. Second, we examine whether providing students with elaborated feedback on own performances improves their learning outcomes. In order to establish the results on the effects of both practices, we conducted a large-scale randomised control trial involving 32 schools and 1,177 students. "
