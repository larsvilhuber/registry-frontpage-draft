abstract: "This study will contribute to our understanding of how Internet-of Things (IoT)-based technologies that enable automated electricity demand management can drive the clean energy transition in low and middle-income countries through an analysis of household energy demand. Randomizing both access to the IoT technology and the timing of automated appliance switch-off events across a large sample of residential smart meter users in India, we will study the factors that affect technology adoption and usage behavior. Leveraging real-time data on how households respond to automated control of selected appliances, we will shed light on the scope for flexibility in their electricity demand. Finally, we will use the experimental variation in electricity supply generated by the IoT algorithm to develop precise time-varying measures of the welfare cost of supply interruptions. "
