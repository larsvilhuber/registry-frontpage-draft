abstract: "Stigma surrounding safety net programs may inhibit take-up among eligibles (Moffitt 1983; Currie 2006) and impose utility costs on individuals already receiving benefits (Kleven & Kopczuk; Anders & Rafkin 2022). In this project, we conduct a survey experiment to investigate the nature of stigma associated with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP or food stamps). We collect respondents’ attitudes about SNAP and perceived judgement of SNAP status among different social groups. We compare individuals’ perceptions about social judgments to the full distribution of respondents’ attitudes to see if perceptions are accurate, particularly for low-income respondents who may be eligible for SNAP. In addition, we test interventions that either reframe SNAP benefits as a tool for economic mobility or inform respondents that one household’s participation decision will not affect whether others can receive benefits. We will measure the effect of the interventions on indices of survey responses describing the degree of stigma perceived by potential recipients and stigmatizing attitudes held by the general population. We will also measure the effect of the intervention on a relevant action: filling out a SNAP eligibility screener. Our study will contribute to the literature on stigma and take-up of safety net programs, focusing on the application decision margin for a highly stigmatized program."
