abstract: "We study whether and how people’s willingness to redistribute is affected by the desire to reward recipients’ previous virtuous behavior, namely the sacrifice of own interest for the community’s sake. We explore the role of recipients’ cooperative levels in making them “deserving” redistribution. An additional objective of the analysis is to study the correlation between own cooperative behavior and redistribution levels."
