abstract: "Exclusive breastfeeding is a cost-effective and key protective measure against diarrhoea and pneumonia, which are leading causes of morbidity and mortality among children under the age of 5 years. We will use behaviourally designed audio stories to evaluate message framing and messenger effects on mothers’ knowledge, attitudes and intention towards exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months.
