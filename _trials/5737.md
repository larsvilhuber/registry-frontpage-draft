abstract: "A growing body of empirical work shows that social recognition of individuals' behavior can meaningfully influence individuals’ choices. This paper studies whether social recognition is a socially efficient lever for influencing individuals’ choices, relative to standard financial incentives. Because social recognition generates utility from esteem to some but disutility from shame to others, it can be either positive-sum, zero-sum, or negative-sum. This depends on whether the social recognition utility function is convex, linear, or concave, respectively. We develop a new revealed preferences methodology that allows us to investigate this question, as well as to structurally estimate leading models of social signaling and their equilibrium implications. We deploy the methods in an online experiment using three different subject pools: (i) participants on Prolific, (ii) UC Berkeley undergraduates recruited from the school’s Xlab, and (iii) Boston University undergraduates who are enrolled in the same economics course."
