abstract: "The choice of whether to screen is important and prevalent in many situations, such as hiring workers or purchasing insurance. It is also implicit in many policy choices. If a policy encourages uniform behavior, different types of people behave similarly, making it impossible to infer the person's type from their behavior. Choosing whether to screen can be difficult because it requires trading off immediate costs with delayed benefits. We propose that individuals may screen too little because they fail to consider the effects of inference. To test this hypothesis, we conduct an online experiment that simulates a hiring scenario with an initial trial task. Participants make two decisions: selecting a trial task and then choosing which candidate to hire. We hypothesize that the majority of participants will opt for the suboptimal task that does not reveal the candidates' quality. This will lead to suboptimal hires and lower payoffs because these participants will not know which candidate is better. We further hypothesize that this mistake is driven largely by the failure to anticipate inference and test this using a treatment that provides inference automatically. Lastly, we test whether planning ahead reduces the mistake and whether participants value it enough. This result would show that planning is a useful intervention, but people may not take it up themselves."
