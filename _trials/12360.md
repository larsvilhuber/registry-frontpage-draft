abstract: "We assess whether an intervention combining mobile technology and behavioral sciences that reaches out to pregnant women and their partners with timely information, nudges and support strategies, contributes to improve pregnancy, birth outcomes, and childrearing behaviors. Smartphones provide fast, comprehensive and sustainable access to women, and can be easily linked to institutional level data that can help personalize information. Research from behavioral economics suggests that information presented in the right way and at the right time can help reorient parental decisions towards children's fundamental development. 

We give pregnant women and their partners access to a chatbot (via WhatsApp) where they can search for information on pregnancy, birth and positive parenting and where they receive messages that nudge them towards adopting healthy habits, managing emotional health, improving parental competencies, and relying on support networks. The intervention starts at gestation week 12 and ends 24 weeks after birth. 

We evaluate the program using a randomized design (N=1500). We recruit participants from local primary care clinics, both public and private, and randomize them to receive the full treatment (full access to the chatbot and messages) or to receive partial treatment (access to infographs on fetal development by gestation week and to a chatbot with limited information (a listing of local resources and useful telephone numbers).

The program can allow policymakers to intervene much earlier, preemptively, and on a larger scale. We expect it to lead to improved and more equitable pregnancy, birth, and child development outcomes."
