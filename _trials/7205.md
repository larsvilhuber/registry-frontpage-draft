abstract: "Small- and Micro-Entreprises (SMEs), which make up the vast majority of businesses in developing countries, typically do not hire many workers, and if they do, they often hire workers from kinship or other social networks of the entrepreneur. These patterns can both exclude workers who are not part of such networks from access to jobs, as well as preventing businesses from hiring the most skilled and productive workers. 

We propose a lab experiment with 300 SME entrepreneurs in Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania, to cleanly answer two questions related to this topic. First, is a worker more (or less) productive when working for a socially/kinship related boss? This will answer the question whether there is an efficiency-based rationale for entrepreneurs to hire socially connected workers. Furthermore, if so, what are the mechanisms that induce workers to be more (or less) productive in such circumstances? Second, turning to the entrepreneurs themselves, we will test whether SME owners face social pressure to hire kin or other socially connected persons.
