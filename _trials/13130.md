abstract: "In a unique experimental setting in digital credit for micro and small enterprises (MSEs), we will randomize eligible digital credit applicants into treatment and control groups (stratified by gender), where the former will receive digital credit while the control group will not get digital credit for at least four months.  In addition, previous studies have also documented that MSEs face multiple constraints, including limited financial knowledge and skills, and addressing only a single credit constraint may not be enough to improve their performance. Therefore, we introduce a second treatment where we combine financial literacy training with digital credit access to explore whether providing financial literacy training could amplify the impacts of digital credit. We will investigate the impacts of digital credit on the welfare of borrowers. To guide the design of our interventions, we will leverage administrative data on existing borrowers of digital credit. The findings are expected to provide insight into policy formulation, product development and modification, customer protection, and default reduction mechanisms in Ethiopia, where digital credit is a new phenomenon, and beyond.
