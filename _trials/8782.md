abstract: "Among bachelor’s degree attaining students, only 58 percent complete within four years. Meanwhile, 26 percent complete in five years and 16 percent complete in 6 or more years. While most students experience substantial labor market returns from attending and completing college, little is known about the heterogeneity in these returns by how much time students take to complete their degree. Understanding this heterogeneity is important especially given the large opportunity costs associated with spending extra time enrolled in college. This study will fill this gap in the literature by studying the relationship between time to degree and labor market outcomes with a résumé audit study that randomly assigns the time to bachelor’s degree indicated on fictitious résumés that are sent to real job postings. A focus of the experiment will be assessing the interaction of the signals of time to degree and college quality. Graduating from a higher quality college could mitigate or exacerbate any time to degree penalties.
