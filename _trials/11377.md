abstract: "Entertainment-education (EE) narratives are powerful persuasion tools that still need to be fully understood and leveraged for public policy. Minimum Diet Diversity (MDD) refers to the concept that children between 6 and 24 months old should be fed a minimum of 4 of 7 food groups along with breastmilk everyday. It may appear complex, technical, and requires people to think in-depth about food choices, in contrast to how people usually think about food, which is often reactionary, emotional, and based on previous practices. To address this problem, the Centre for Social & Behaviour Change, Ashoka University developed EE resources for health messaging to use the power of stories that engage peopleâ€™s interest and increase their recall of information and ideas. 

Through this experiment, we aim to understand the effectiveness of episodic narrative style videos and standalone song adaptation videos developed by CSBC in increasing knowledge, attitudes and intention (KAI) to change feeding practices for young children compared to KAI for existing MDD collaterals used by the government.
