abstract: "We examine whether the gender-variant preferences for competition identified in the literature apply in decision-making for others (DMfO). Specifically, we will conduct a laboratory experiment in which subjects make decisions regarding willingness to compete on behalf of themselves and on behalf of others.  Our willingness to compete measure follows closely the measure used in Neiderle and Vesterlund (2007). 
Subjects will be assigned (by session) to either make decisions on behalf of themselves first (control) or on behalf of a randomly-assigned subject in the same session first (treatment).  It warrants mention that when making decisions on behalf of another subject, the decision maker will know the gender of the person on whose behalf they are making the decision.  All subjects will make decisions both on behalf of themselves and others; the only difference between treatment and control groups is the order in which they make those decisions.  The study includes a second experimental intervention. Specifically, half of the subjects will be randomly-assigned to the "skin in the game" condition.  These subjects will receive 10 percent of the earnings of subject on whose behalf they make the decision if the payment task is a DMfO task.  The other half of the subjects will make un-incentivized DMfO decisions.  Thus, the study is a 2 X 2 designed: DMfO first or DMfO second versus skin-in-the-game condition or no skin-in-the-game condition.  

This investigation of willingness to compete in DMfO is motivated by two policy-relevant factors. First, a popular explanation for gender differences in various academic and labor-market settings is a lack of mentorship for women. DMfO research can help understand the nature of mentor’s decisions. Second, sponsorship (giving mentors a stake in mentee’s outcomes) has been proposed as a policy to help close gender gaps. In an experiment similar to Niederle and Vesterlund, Baldiga & Coffman (2018) find that sponsorship only serves to increase the
competitiveness of the worst performing men, thereby increasing the gender gap in willingness to compete. In the Baldiga & Coffman experiment, though, sponsors did not make decisions on behalf of subjects, nor did they indicate in any way what they thought subjects should do; as such, the effect of DMfO, an important dimension of real-world mentorship/sponsorship relationships, has not been studied in this context."
