abstract: "This study evaluates the impact of the LnL (Living & Learning) Program, a residential college program launched in March 2023 by Seoul National University (SNU). The purpose of the LnL program is to enable students from various majors and backgrounds to cohabit in a dormitory for a year, immersing themselves in diverse experiences. Out of the freshmen who applied for the LnL program, 235 were randomly chosen to live together for one year. In collaboration with the SNU, we will evaluate the impact of the LnL program on academic and non-academic outcomes using information obtained from surveys and students' records."
