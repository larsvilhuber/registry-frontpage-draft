abstract: "Many paternalistic decisions are made by groups. For example, political parties and government bodies pass laws that restrict the choice sets of citizens, parents restrict the choices of their children and board of directors make decisions that affect the choices of the firm's employees. A small strand of literature has studied why, when and how individuals act paternalistically, but there is no evidence on the paternalistic behavior of groups. However, it is widely acknowledged that groups often behave differently than individuals. Motivated by these considerations, the objective of this study is to investigate paternalism among groups and to study if there are differences in acting paternalistically between individuals and groups. We design a controlled laboratory experiment to study our research questions. "
