abstract: "I study whether Malawians' responses to HIV risks are "fatalistic", meaning that they respond to increased risks by having more risky sex rather than less. I randomly provide information about the true risk of HIV transmission, which is lower than people think it is, to a sample of sexually-active adults in the Zomba district of southern Malawi. This is an area where previous ethnographic and correlational research has documented behavior that appears fatalistic. I then measure how people change their sexual behavior in response to the information treatment, looking for evidence of a U-shaped relationship between risk beliefs and risky sex."
