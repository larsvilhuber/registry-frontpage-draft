abstract: "Our project focuses on the gendered preferences in forms of political action. Given the consistent differences in the types of actions in which women participate in comparation to men, and the still significant gender gap in party related activities, we want to understand the characteristics that make one type of action more or less attractive for women. This document pre-registers the research design for a survey experiment we will conduct in July 2023 in an online panel to a sample of the Spanish population. We discuss the recruitment of participants, the main hypotheses we seek to test with the conjoint experiment, and the analysis we plan to conduct for testing the hypotheses . All changes to the strategy discussed in this document will be made transparent in the publications presenting the findings."
