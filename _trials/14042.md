abstract: "Domestic violence and forced arranged marriages in Uzbekistan remain taboo topics due to conservative national traditions and institutional landscape. Out of shame, societal stigma or fear, local women usually conceal incidents of domestic violence or their forced marriages. As a consequence, there is only limited data and a lack of statistics on this issue. We decided to tackle this problem concerning sensitive questions by conducting two lists of experiments among the female students of Tashkent University. Each experiment consists of two questions to estimate personal experience and attitudes on topics of domestic violence and forced marriage. The list experiment allows us to evaluate the underreporting rates on questions for both topics by comparing the frequency of item choices between the control and treatment groups and from answers to the direct questions in the control group. The design ensures the anonymization of the participants to protect the respondents"
