abstract: "We designed a field experiment to measure how housing price expectations affect real estate transactions in the United States. Our motivation stems from the fact that home price expectations play a prominent role in many accounts of the housing boom that occurred during the mid-2000s. We will launch a large-scale high-stakes information experiment with 60,000 households who have recently listed their houses for sale."
