abstract: "The use of Large Language Models (LLM) could have a profound impact on the labor market. The first part of this research project (AEARCTR-0013355) illustrates that the quality of cover letters improves as job seekers can use LLMs (such as ChatGPT) when writing their cover letter â€“ as evaluated by recruiters who were blind to the treatment arms. However, the second part of the research project focuses on recruiters, to understand their perceptions of the use of LLMs in cover letters and job applications more generally. This is done through an online lab experiment, with recruiters from Prolific."
