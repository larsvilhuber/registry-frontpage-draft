abstract: "In this project, we study the role of a human as opposed to an algorithmic mediator in compliance decisions of the users. We work in partnership with one of the largest mental health apps in India. The app enables matching between users in need of mental health support and therapists who are able to provide it. When users register in the app they are offered to undergo a psychological assessment that would improve the suggested therapist match. In this experiment, we vary if the prompt to undergo an assessment comes from a human mediator or from the system. A priori it is not clear if making the involvement of algorithm salient would increase or decrease the take up of the assessment in the context of mental health. Given the shortage of psychologists and high demand for mental health support, technologies such as mental health mobile apps are a powerful force in delivering mental health support to those in need. The results of our study are therefore of high applied importance and through a better match with a therapist can improve the welfare of many.
