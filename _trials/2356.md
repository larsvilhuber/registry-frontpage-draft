abstract: "Early childhood is widely recognized as a critical phase of human development, and interventions targeted at this stage have a farther reaching impact than those targeted later in life.  The aim of this project is to evaluate impact of pre-schooling and home visits by teachers on childrenâ€™s cognitive, language, social and emotional development and school readiness in remote rural communities  Bangladesh."
