abstract: "Currently, twenty-six states bar some individuals from voting, simply on the basis of their past felony convictions. On April 7, 2021, the State of Washington enacted law HB 1078, which fully restored voting rights to Washingtonians with past convictions upon release from prison. Despite this recent change in law, uncertainty for many potential beneficiaries about eligibility, paired with the fact that voting illegally in Washington can carry a punishment of up to 5 years of imprisonment and/or a $10,000 fine, may cause many individuals with prior felonies to not embrace their newly obtained opportunity to vote. Accordingly, voter turnout among this population can likely be bolstered by targeted information campaigns. This project aims to measure how outreach using social media impacts voter registration and turnout, among a population likely already treated with traditional mailers and other voter outreach efforts."
