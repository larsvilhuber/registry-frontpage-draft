abstract: "Education tells us that providing students with timely and constructive feedback is key to their learning. Behavioural science tells us that feedback that is personalised and aligns with students’ motivational styles, is more engaging and more likely to be acted on. In this research, we will apply these principles by sending ‘personalised’ progress emails to students throughout a semester, to ‘nudge’ them towards better quiz engagement and performance. The emails will be worded using loss vs gain framing (how much they have lost vs gained) to appeal to different motivational styles, and impact will be measured using learning analytics and quiz grades.
