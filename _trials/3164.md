abstract: "Decision makers tend to focus on those aspects of the choice context that stand out or are salient. This idea has been modeled recently in a number of papers, introducing the concept of salience into economics and seeking to explain the impact of limited attention on economic choice. It remains an open question whether it is the numerical values themselves or the assigned decision values that attract attention and guide behavior. We test for this distinction in a laboratory experiment.
