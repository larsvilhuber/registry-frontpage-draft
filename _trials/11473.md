abstract: "We evaluate the impact of modifying the traditional design of crop insurance contracts on smallholder farmers' preference for crop insurance and uptake rates. The study addresses the low take-up of crop insurance among smallholders in developing countries. It aims to assess the effects of two modifications: (i) offering insurance after the harvest of the preceding season instead of the beginning of the insured season, and (ii) allowing farmers to make premium payments flexibly  in multiple transactions over an extended period. The RCT involves a sample of 1,740 farmers from four counties in Kenya, who are part of the Kenya Climate Smart Agricultural Program (KCSAP). Farmers' preferences and willingness to pay for insurance are measured using the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) mechanism, in addition with data on time preferences, risk preferences, liquidity access, and socio-economic factors. The analysis will compare the willingness to pay for insurance, uptake rates, and preferred  insured amounts between the treatment groups. The findings will contribute to understanding the impact of  contract modifications on crop insurance uptake , shedding light on strategies to improve the resilience of smallholder farmers to income shocks as well as ex-ante effects on adverse selection.
