abstract: "We run a survey of Turkish households in which randomized treatments provide different types of information about the first and second moments of inflation, in a high inflation environment. First, while factors commonly cited in the literature—such as education, income, gender, or age—do not significantly explain the cross-sectional variation in aggregate inflation expectations, the city of residence emerges as a significant determinant, reflecting spatial heterogeneity in the cost of living. Second, our information treatments, based on publicly available data, successfully generate significant exogenous variation in inflation expectations, even in a setting of very high inflation. Third, we analyze the causal impact of these changes in inflation expectations on households’ consumption and saving plans. We find that higher inflation expectations reduce expected spending, reflecting households' stagflationary outlook: a 10 percentage point increase in inflation expectations corresponds to a roughly 3.5 percentage point decline in total and nondurable expected spending, along with a 3 percentage point decrease in the likelihood of durable goods purchases. This provides empirical evidence that the expected income channel dominates the intertemporal substitution channel."
