abstract: "In this experiment we investigate to what extent differences in preferences for earnings over the life cycle explain preferences for different career paths. We implement a survey experiment in a representative sample of adults that asks respondents to indicate their preferences for one of two career paths. Respondents will be randomly selected into a labeled or an unlabeled treatment group: In the first case, respondents will know the annual income over the life cycle for each career path; in the second case, respondents will additionally be aware that one career requires vocational education, while the other requires university education. This experimental setup allows us to analyse to what extent factors other than income contribute to explaining preferences over career- and education choices."
