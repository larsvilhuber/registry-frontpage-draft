abstract: "In Chile, significant challenges are faced in the mental health and well-being of children. One in every five children has a mental health disorder, and 70% have experienced violence at home. Additionally, the country leads in marijuana and cocaine use among youth in Latin America. To address these issues, we propose a scalable socio-emotional intervention that aims to improve the socio-emotional well-being of children in vulnerable contexts. The intervention design involves to enhance socio-emotional skills, to align them with children's tastes and preferences through the creation of cultural, sports, and scientific communities. This study aims to measure the causal effect on socio-emotional skills and psychosocial problems of children aged 9-10 years old. The evaluation will test if the programme improvements lead to an increase in socio-emotional outcomes usign a cluster randomised control trial."
