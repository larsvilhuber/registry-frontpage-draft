abstract: "We conduct a survey experiment in Spain during the third week of the lock-down. This week was around the peak (information of 30/03/20) of the Covid-19 pandemic in Spain. Different regions are still on different trajectories as the onset happened at different points in time, resulting in heterogeneity across regions. We provide two information treatments to participants and collect various outcomes regarding public health and public finance. "
