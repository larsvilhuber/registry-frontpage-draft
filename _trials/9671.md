abstract: "Emerging research suggests potential success of tutoring lessons to help students mitigate learning losses accumulated during the COVID-19-related school closures. 
In this project, we investigate whether informing about income losses that can be attributed to decreased schooling and skill development can affect planned participation in tutoring lessons and the willingness-to-pay for tutoring in Germany. For that purpose, we implement two parallel survey experiments in a sample of adolescent children aged between 14 and 17 years and their parents. The randomly selected treatment group is informed about the losses in lifetime income due to the equivalent of one year fewer schooling. By comparing responses between the uninformed control group and the treatment group, we evaluate whether our information affects intended registration/participation in tutoring lessons, willingness-to-pay for tutoring, and information acquisition by both, parents and adolescents. We pose the same questions to both parents and their children separately.
