abstract: "We will conduct a randomized controlled trial of management trial in the automotive sector targeting tier 2 and tier 3, mostly local suppliers. Our training features the Kaizen approach, which is a Japan-pioneered production management approach, and the training will be provided in two phases. We will analyze its impacts on adopted management practices, business performance, and corporate cohesion. Corporate cohesion has been one of the major social problems in this formally segregated country. We will test whether the improved production management that requires the cooperation of managers and workers will improve corporate cohesion. We will conduct a baseline survey in 2022, followed by the provision of the training, and will conduct follow-up surveys in 2023 and 2024."
