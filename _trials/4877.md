abstract: "Unitary and collective household models assume efficient allocation of resources within the household. A body of literature indicates, however, that the preferences of the household may be pareto-inefficient. Inefficiencies are potentially associated with substantial losses to individual and household welfare in particular when public goods are underprovided or when household members have different consumption preferences. Using data from 400 households, we test the inefficiency hypothesis using a novel revealed preference approach. We elicit the willingness of women and men to pay to receive a small and instant cash transfer in private instead of in front of their partners. Using follow-up survey data collected a week after the experiment, we analyze the spending patterns of those who receive money in private vs. in front of their partners."
