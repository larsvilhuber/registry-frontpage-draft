abstract: "This paper studies the effects of managerial attention on physical activity in a field experiment. In our experiment, the agents can continuously and repeatedly choose their own work effort, which has direct effects on a health-related outcome. To increase efforts and outcomes, the principal provides managerial attention depending on treatments. We systematically vary between groups if and how agents get managerial attention. Thus, we compare groups who won’t receive managerial attention at all with a group where managerial attention occurs randomly and two groups where managerial attention directly depends on participants performance. Managerial attention will be provided e.g., in the form of short videos, messages, or voice notes at a max. of 3 days a week. Therefore, there are multiple occasions a week where managerial attention is provided external or earned by performance. 

We run the experiment within an ongoing, 365-day long study with about 600 participants who all aim at improving their physical activity. All those subjects have been positively health screened, are using a smartphone app (ActiVAtE Behavior) to transmit their steps (main performance measure) in a timely manner and have provided extensive individual survey data including socio-demographics, body measures, health goals, motivation, etc.. Furthermore, we have gathered their economic preferences (e.g. competitiveness, social preferences, risk preferences, cheating) using survey-based, incentivized experimental games (e.g. Ultimatum Game, Public Goods Games, Holt-Laury-Lottery, Dictator Game, Coin Toss Game). Besides, we use an incentivized belief elicitation about their previous relative performance. Most of the participants are also equipped with a fitness tracker (medisana ViFit Run) to collect data without carrying their smartphones. The consent forms and data protection concept have been approved by the University of Vechta’s data protection officer. Since participants have been recruited via television and radio within a region with about 1 million inhabitants and there was never an in-person individual or group meeting, people usually do not know each other.
