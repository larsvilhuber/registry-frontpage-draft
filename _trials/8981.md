abstract: "Framing effects of losses and gains are trailed in an online field experiment on donations and charitable behaviour. By partnering up with a conservation NGO, we exploit the recent extinction and the recent rediscovery of a previously thought extinct specie (Both Galapagos tortoises) to test the effects of a loss and a gain frame."
