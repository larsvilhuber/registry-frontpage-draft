abstract: "Abstract

Productivity growth in firms remains a pressing policy issue worldwide. Inspired by the Randomised Control Trial (RCT henceforth) conducted by Adem et al.(2023, AEARCTR-0007125) for the distilling industry in the UK, we complement this research by focusing on a different sector and country, the textile sector in Spain. Moreover, we contribute to the previous literature by appraising how the degree of detail and the frequency of feedback information affect the adoption of digital innovation.

At the heart of our research is the exploration of the effects of information gaps on technology adoption and overall business performance. To this end, we inform a comprehensive set of textile firms in Spain. The research relied on a database provided by BTOMAIL, a company specialized in compiling and supplying email address lists segmented by product category and geographical area. BTOMAIL ensures the validity and updating of its data, complying with the privacy standards established by the GDPR. Then, we randomly select a group of these firms to provide them with more detailed feedback on their website improvements. The purpose of such an experiment is to estimate how the detail of feedback about online efficacy metrics influence the broader adoption of digital technologies. To conduct the study, we employ the following treatment arms:


Treatment Arm 1 (Benchmarked Information Provision): Firms in this group receive direct information regarding their website's performance. This information offers insights from various metrics, including website speed, search engine efficiency, and user engagement. 


Treatment Arm 2 (Benchmarked Information Provision + Link to more detailed information): Firms in this treatment arm receive not only the benchmarked information provided in Treatment Arm 1 but also a supplementary link that allows them to access to more detailed information. In particular, this link directs them to a platform offering in-depth analyses of their website's performance and recommendations for improving efficiency and optimising the reach of their website. 


Treatment Arm 3 (Benchmarked Information Provision + Link with more detailed information + Bimonthly Feedback): Firms in this treatment arm receive the services of Treatment Arm 2 and are also informed that their website performance will be monitored bimonthly. Under this treatment, firms are presented with a comprehensive report every other month, providing further insights into the long-term efficiency and reach of their websites.

We have opted not to include a control group devoid of any information. This decision is motivated by the RCT conducted by Adem et al. (2023) in the UK, which demonstrated that providing benchmark information to UK firms did not significantly affect subsequent firms’ decisions compared to the non-informed group at the conventional levels. 

The information provided is compiled using a sophisticated toolkit that benchmarks individual firm data against industry standards. This toolkit draws insights from technology usage data sourced from built with, website speed information from batch speed, and search engine performance metrics from Moz.

The principal objective of this research is to estimate the effect of providing feedback on the web performance of Spanish textile firms on subsequent decisions to improve it.

Although preliminary findings within the distilling sector in the UK indicated that the provision of benchmark information had negligible effects, it is interesting to examine whether the textile sector in Spain— with its distinct regional characteristics, industry-specific nuances, and exposure to various treatment arms—responds similarly or exhibits different patterns of reaction.
