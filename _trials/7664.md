abstract: "We estimate perceptions of taxes and support for redistribution for a representative urban population in Mexico. Furthermore, we analyze whether people adjust the degree of preferred redistribution when information is provided on scenarios in which high-income people pay more taxes. To do this, we create four treatment groups and a control within a sample of 3,060 participants. Each group received information about a scenario in which the highest income group in the country will pay 60%, 50%, 40% or 20% of their income in taxes."
