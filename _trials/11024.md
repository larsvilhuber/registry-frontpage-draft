abstract: "We plan to collect experimental data among NYC job seekers 12 months after enactment of Local Law 2022/59 to assess the impact of manipulated pay range sizes in hypothetical job advertisements on pay expectations and intended asks. We seek to determine if there is a differential impact of pay range size by gender, racial/ethnic group membership, and income level/type.
