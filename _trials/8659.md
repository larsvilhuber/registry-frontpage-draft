abstract: "Low awareness of technology is a big concern in low income countries, especially for smallholder farmers who constitutes nearly 70 percent of their population. Advancement in information and communication technologies and digital farmer services open new avenues to connect millions of smallholders with low cost. At the same time, an increased role of women in farming due to male out-migration is widely reported in India, and hence it is important to understand methods to improve the awareness, education and ability of female farmers. It is unclear whether the digital revolution in Indian agriculture further deepen the gender gap or provide an opportunity for women farmers to get access to information on new technologies and services.  In this project we designed an experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of institutionalized advisory services, particularly to women farmers and the adoption of technologies when the advisories are developed for the landscape where smallholder farmers cultivate their crops.
