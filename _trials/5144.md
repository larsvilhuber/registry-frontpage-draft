abstract: "The low completion rates for Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) has long been a controversial topic. While some see the low rates of completion as a sign of inefficiency, others argue that completion rate is a misleading index as MOOCs give students the freedom to learn what they want without finishing the course. However, the latter argument only makes sense if students do achieve their personalized learning goals on MOOCs. This project aims to answer two sets of questions: first, does self-control play a role in explaining the low completion rates for MOOCs? If the answer is yes, it means the low rates of completion is indeed a problem. Then the next question is can we design some interventions to raise the rate of completion? In particular, we plan to design personalized commitment devices based on students' present biases. One design choice we need to make is whether to inform them that their answers to the time preference elicitation questions will be used to calculate the optimal commitment devices for them. If they know in advance that the elicited present bias will affect the commitment contracts they later get, then they have incentives to game the system. However, whether they will be truth-telling or not when answering the time preferences questions is an empirical question and we plan to test that before we implement the interventions. The basic idea is to randomly select half of the subjects to inform them the personalized interventions in the future before they answer the questions and leave the other half uninformed. Then we can test whether their elicited time preferences/present biases are drawn from the same distribution or not. If we cannot reject the null hypothesis, then we can conclude that it is safe to inform the subjects in advance that the commitment devices they will get is contingent on their elicited time preferences.
