abstract: "This study investigates whether and, if so, to what extent relative wealth placement, i. e. an individual’s relative position in the wealth distribution, impact individuals’ risk-taking behavior. We first develop a stylized model where concerns about relative wealth enter utility and derive several hypotheses how placement in the wealth distribution affects risk-taking. Generally, we hypothesize that concerns about relative wealth placement specifically increase (decrease) risk-taking among the individuals placed at the bottom (top) of the wealth distribution. In addition, we derive reasonable conditions under which placement at the bottom (top) of the wealth distribution leads to more (less) risk-taking than being placed in the middle of the distribution, c.p. Further, we conduct an experimental study to disentangle relative wealth changes from absolute wealth changes."
