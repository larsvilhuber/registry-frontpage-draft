abstract: "The Equal Pay Law mandates that firms pay the same wage to workers employed in the same occupation. In this experiment, we aim to investigate the impact of an Equal Pay Policy on hiring discrimination at varying levels of competition in the labour market. We've designed a online experiment where we'll use the concept of a reservation wage to emulate the Hotelling model (Hotelling, 1929), thereby introducing competition into the hiring market. The experiment is designed to answer three questions: 1) How does an equal pay policy influence employers' wage decisions for different groups? 2) How does an equal pay policy affect employers' hiring decisions for different groups? 3)	Does competition in the labour market influence the impact of the equal pay policy?
