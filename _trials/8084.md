abstract: "Mass Vaccinations are crucial to fight global pandemics. The question, however, remains how to optimally encourage vaccinations amid high levels of vaccine hesitancy and resistance. We conduct a randomized control trial with teachers across Pakistan and study vaccination uptake using actual vaccination certifications and study our treatments impact on both on teachers and its intergenerational transmission of norms regulating vaccine take-up and trust in students. Specifically, we horse race cash payments, lottery cash prizes, messages from celebrity and role models to encourage vaccinations and investigate their impact on vaccine take-up and hesitancy. Linking survey responses to actual vaccinations via certificates allow us to obtain study both stated preference and revealed preference behavior regarding vaccine take-up.
