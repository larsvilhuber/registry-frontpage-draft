abstract: "The retention of qualified health workers is a key challenge in developing countries. This trial evaluates the effect of monetary and non-monetary incentives provided to midwives employed by the Nigerian Subsidy Reinvestment and Empowerment Programme (SURE-P), on their length of service, performance, behaviour and wellbeing. It also investigates the effect of these incentives on maternal and child health and healthcare use. Finally, the trial investigates the behavioural channels through which the provision of incentives affects the outcomes of interest.
