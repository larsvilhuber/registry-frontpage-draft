abstract: "The prevalence of obesity in the U.S. has more than doubled since 1980.  In part to address this rise, as well as to promote healthy eating more generally, the U.S. passed a nationwide menu label law as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.  Starting December 1, 2016, all chain restaurants in the U.S. will be required to list calorie counts next to each menu item.  This study tests how providing such calorie count information affects restaurant patrons’ food choices.  A randomized experiment will be conducted, with some restaurant patrons receiving menus with calorie counts, while others will receive the same menus but without calorie counts.  Patrons’ choices of appetizers, drinks, entrees, and desserts will be recorded.  The project tests whether providing calorie information leads to fewer calories ordered, and whether such decreases are particularly common in the dessert category.  Differences in the effect by gender and other characteristics will be examined.  The results of this study will be informative about the effects of the nationwide menu label law that takes effect in May 2018."
