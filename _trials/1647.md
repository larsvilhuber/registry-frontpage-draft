abstract: "While commercialization of agriculture has the potential to benefit small-scale producers, the transition to cash cropping does not always improve welfare. Shifts in intra-household allocation arising from this transition may be one explanation. While women often participate in cash crop production, in this context it is almost exclusively men who are responsible for sales and profit allocation. In this study we undertake two interventions to increase women’s participation in cash crop production and management and their access to profits. Can increasing women’s economic empowerment in this way change outcomes at the household level? Random assignment of households into treatment and control groups will allow for a rigorous estimation of the interventions’ impacts. Outcomes of interest include women’s bargaining power within the home, crop management and production, fulfillment of production contracts, the intra-household allocation of profits, household food security, and child welfare."
