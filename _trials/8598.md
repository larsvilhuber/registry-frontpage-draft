abstract: "There has been a rise in incidence of malnutrition in India between 2018 and 2019 (Vir & Suri, 2020). The pandemic has made matters worse, putting those already vulnerable at most risk. The main objective of this project is to understand whether raising awareness among mothers (the primary caregiver) can help improve the health and wellbeing of both the mothers as well as their young children. Moreover, since mothers are primarily responsible for child care, we also plan to see if improving mental health and wellbeing of mothers have an added effect."
