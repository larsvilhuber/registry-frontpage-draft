abstract: "Currently, twenty-six states bar individuals from voting, simply on the basis of convictions in their past. On August 5, 2020, Governor Kim Reynolds of Iowa issued Executive Order 7 which fully restored voting rights to Iowans with past convictions once the terms of incarceration, probation, parole, or special sentence were completed. Despite this recent change in law, uncertainty for many potential beneficiaries about eligibility, paired with the fact that voting illegally in Iowa can carry a punishment of up to 5 years of imprisonment, may cause many individuals with prior felonies to not embrace their newly obtained opportunity to vote. Accordingly, voter turnout among this population can likely be bolstered by targeted information campaigns. This paper aims to measure the impact of such an outreach effort. Specifically, we seek to measure how outreach using traditional mailers---a commonly used but expensive method for voter outreach---compares with outreach using social media and mixed social media/opt-in SMS campaigns."
