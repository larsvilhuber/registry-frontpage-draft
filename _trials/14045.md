abstract: "Air pollution is a serious problem in many regions of the developing world as it adversely affects the health, education and human capital of the population, especially children. Mitigating strategies can potentially alleviate some of the most severe effects of high air pollution. By conducting an RCT in Delhi's KV schools, this study assesses the potential role of technological and behavioral strategies in mitigating the adverse effects of high air pollution exposure on the health and educational outcomes of students. In particular, we evaluate the effectiveness of air purifiers in classrooms and an educational campaign during the period of peak air pollution. This work is important for building human capital in low- and middle-income countries faced with high pollution levels, which is essential for their human and economic development. "
