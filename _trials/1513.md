abstract: "This paper analyzes the impact of Honduran conditional cash transfers on turnout and incumbent vote share in presidential elections, using two randomized experiments. Before the 2001 presidential elections, the PRAF-II experiment randomly assigned households in 40 of 70 municipalities to receive small conditional cash transfers, only intended to cover the costs of complying with education and health conditions (Galiani and McEwan, 2013; IFPRI, 2000). Then, in late 2011, the Bono 10,000 experiment randomly assigned 816 villages to three treatment arms. Of these, 150 of these were randomly selected for the treatment group, and another 150 were randomly selected for the control group. The former received the treatment immediately after the baseline was completed, and the latter received it immediately after the evaluationâ€™s endline survey was completed (but 5 months before the 2013 elections, a choice that turned out to be useful for our research). The remaining 516 villages were not monitored by the evaluation team, and received transfers according to standard procedures. We refer to the three groups as CCT1, CCT2, and CCT3. CCT1 received the largest cumulative transfers (by design, substantially larger than PRAF-II). CCT2 and CCT3 received the same cumulative amounts, but much less than CCT1. However, CCT2 received its payments closer to the election than CCT3. Thus, the two experiments provide variation in both the cumulative amount and the timing of payment sequences. However, both experiments were objectively targeted at poor geographic areas with more than 10% of Honduran voters, and both policies were both administered by the same government agency."
