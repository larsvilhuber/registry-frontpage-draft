abstract: "Singaporeâ€™s total fertility rate stands at 1.25, well below the population replacement level. One of the reasons for the low rate is a relatively high average age at childbearing. This study attempts to understand the factors behind timing of parenthood after marriage, including the attitudes and motivations of Singaporean women towards childbearing, as well as the constraints and issues they face.
