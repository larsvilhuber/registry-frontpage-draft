abstract: "This study will evaluate whether changes to the integrated voice response (IVR) system and messages that callers to the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline hear can decrease the proportion of callers who abandon their calls (i.e., hang up) before being connected to a person at a local call center. The intervention involves changing the message script and voice recording that callers hear during the initial IVR (before a call is routed) and the script, voice recording, and waiting music that callers hear while waiting to be connected to a counselor. Callers will be assigned to either the control or treatment condition based on a randomization of the last 4 digits of 10-digit phone numbers. During the approximately 3-week study period, calls with the 5000 randomly selected 4-digit sequences will be assigned to the control version of the IVR and queue message, and the other 5000 will be assigned to the treatment version. All phone callers to the line during the study period will be included in the evaluation. We will compare outcomes for incoming callers who are randomly allocated to hear either the current version or the intervention version. The primary outcome of interest is the likelihood that a caller stays on the line and is connected to a crisis counselor. Secondary outcomes include whether a caller remains on the line until being routed, call duration (time until abandon or connection), use of the 988 text option from the same phone number, whether a caller connects to a counselor via text or phone, repeat call to 988 within 24 hours, and selection of IVR menu items.
