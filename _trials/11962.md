abstract: "In the field of applied research, ensuring data quality has emerged as a significant concern, as evidenced by a substantial body of literature. Over the past two decades, there have been notable advancements in data collection procedures. This includes a transition from traditional paper-based data collection to tablet-based CAPI methods, as well as improvements in telephonic data collection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite several innovations on the technology side of the data collection process, field enumerator-level initiatives are quite few. Guidelines from most think-tanks and research labs focus on survey training and survey manuals. Some researchers recommend conducting tests at the end of the survey training, to enhance awareness of field enumerators. 

The field experiment is mounted on a household survey that will be collected as part of a baseline survey of a school milk program in Gujarat, India. The state has historically experienced higher incidence of stunting and malnutrition among children and continues to do so. Therefore, the program seeks to provide liquid milk in government schools in order to improve child nutrition status. The experiment is therefore an attempt to generate causal evidence on how to improve the quality of anthropometric and other sensitive data at the individual and household level. In addition to standard household modules (including roster, assets, income, etc.), the study survey captures information on child anthropometry, child consumption, mother's well-being and her activity status. 

The experiment consists of three treatment arms that randomly allocates 60 field enumerators using block-design across 120 villages: (i) enumerators in the control group villages receive a standard survey training with no tests (C), (ii) enumerators in the first treatment group solve three tests at the end of each day of the training and receive non-agentic feedbacks (T1), and (iii) enumerators in the second treatment group solve an identical tests as T1 but in addition they receive agentic feedbacks with an option for resubmission based on feedbacks (T2). The field experiment can examine the effect of frequent testing during survey trainings (T1 versus C) and variations in feedbacks on quality of survey data (T1 versus T2 and T2 versus C). 

The experimental design facilitates the estimation of the test effect and agentic feedback on the quality of survey data. Quality of survey data is assessed from high-frequency checks that are completed on each day of the field work. The potential channel for generic testing includes awareness while agentic feedbacks may trigger mechanisms such as motivation, self-confidence, and self-responsibility.
