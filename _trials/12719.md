abstract: "Humanitarian organizations are facing a challenge: the number of refugees is constantly increasing, however funds are not growing as quickly. Hence they need to focus on proven and effective interventions to help refugees regain their self-reliance. There are two main interventions that help refugees regain self-reliance: (1) the Graduation Approach, and (2) Limited-duration unconditional cash transfers. The Graduation Approach is a 2-year program which consists of trainings, savings groups, and a cash transfer (some programs have additional components). While other studies have documented high effectiveness - including several years later (Banerjee et al., 2015; 2022) - the Graduation Approach is very costly, logistically challenging, and time-intensive. Hence it is less scalable compared with unconditional cash transfers, which are becoming more widely adopted among humanitarian organizations. Nevertheless, there are no studies comparing the (cost-)effectiveness of the two interventions in a humanitarian context. Hence the evidence base for NGOs to allocate their funding, is very limited."
