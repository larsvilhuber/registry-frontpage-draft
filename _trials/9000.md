abstract: "Industrial platform, promoting cooperation between suppliers of manufactures, is attracting entrepreneurs’ active engagements. Meanwhile, trillions of dollars are invested in sustainable businesses each year. However, we still lack a complete understanding of how entrepreneurs make their decisions on the choice of industrial platforms in accordance with their social preferences. The literature mainly resorts to industrial platforms’ sustainability strategies, but entrepreneurs, as industrial platforms’ users, are neglected. We investigate users’ social preferences on industrial platforms, including their trade-off strategies, beliefs on industrial platforms’ profitability of high ESG，and ambiguity perceptions on ESG factors of industrial platforms, in an incentivized lab experiment. We employed a discrete choice experiment to obtain subjects’ willingness to pay on ESG and other determinators of industrial platform selection and designed methods to evaluate their perception of the level of ambiguity formally. We found that when it comes to high ESG industrial platforms, subjects are likely to forgo 3.062% annual profit, expected higher profitability, and perceived lower ambiguity. This suggests that the unincentivized survey of ESG-related expected profitability could be systematically biased. Our results contribute to understanding the true motives of industrial platform selection combined with ESG factors."
