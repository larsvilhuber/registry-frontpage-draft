abstract: "Our study investigates whether females in single-sex environments are more inclined to take on leadership roles in group activities. To achieve this, we conduct a laboratory experiment that recruited high school students from single-sex and mixed-sex schools and randomly assigning them to either single-sex or mixed-sex groups. We measure their willingness to lead and self-confidence while controlling for risk preference. Through this experiment, we aim to examine the interaction term between single-sex schools and single-sex groups."
