abstract: "We investigate the effects of the Covid-19 pandemics on several topics related to the spread of populism attitudes over the Italian public opinion. Among these, trust in the institutions, the relationship with the European Union and solidarity among European states, opinions on science and the role of experts, physicians, scientists, the importance of democracy. The research is based on an experimental design, which involves an online survey to be conducted on 4 groups of respondents – which will be exposed to different stimulus related to the initiatives adopted by European institutions and political leaders and the reactions of politicians and scientists to the spread of the pandemics – and a control group that will be not exposed to such stimulus.
