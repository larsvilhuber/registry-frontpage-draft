abstract: "Kinesio tape is a drug-free and an elastic therapeutic tape used for treating various musculoskeletal problems such as injury, pain, and dysfunction and a variety of other disorders[9]. The kinesiotaping was found to be effective in stimulation of large and small intestinal peristaltism and treated constipation in a case report[10]. Kinesio taping aplications were created by a Japanese chiropractor, Dr Kenso Kase, in the 1970s. Although the exact mechanisms of the effects of are not yet clear, some investigators claimed that Kinesio taping has multiple functions. The inventor stated that the tape should be applied from origin to insertion to inhibit msucle function[10, 11]. The vomiting is chracterised by the retrograd peristaltism(movement) of gastrointestinal smooth muscle function. So the hypothesis of our study is based on the inhibition of retrograd peristaltism of gastrointestinal system by applying the kinesiotape from origin(from top to bottom where the stomach is placed on the abdominal region) to insertion(alongside the gastric curvature) so as to decrease the vomiting and maybe nause which is predominately induced by the central nervous system

To investigate the effect of Kinesio taping on nausea and vomiting in women with emesis gravidarum."
