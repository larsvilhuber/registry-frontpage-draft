abstract: "This study, conducted by the Government of the Madagascar’s Ministry of Social Protection and the Promotion of Women with the support of the World Bank’s Africa Gender Innovation Lab (GIL), will evaluate the impact of a multi-year cash-for-work program in Madagascar. This impact evaluation (IE) will assess the impact of the Cash for Work (Argent Contre Travail – ACT) program on communities’ productive assets through water-and soil management, terracing, reforestation etc. In addition, it assesses the impact of cash transfer on agricultural productivity, livelihoods and welfare of the household."
