abstract: "A first pilot study finds that when the choice menu of a service provider includes a single-use subscription, it is frequently preferred over a costlier, long-term alternative. Once single-use is replaced by an extended option for the same price, fewer subjects favor it. We conjecture that single-use in the former choice set appeals to a rather rational evaluation, while in the latter comparison the alternatives are decoded along the same category - referred to pigeonholing - with the consequence that other salient comparative criteria come to the fore and fade rational evaluation into the background. A two-dimensional framework present in most behavioral models fails to explain this type of preference reversal. Based on the conception of transaction utility (Thaler, 1985) we propose a generalization of salience theory (Bordalo, Gennaioli, and Shleifer, 2012) able to capture the effect of pigeonholing."
