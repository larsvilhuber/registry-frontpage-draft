abstract: "A (somewhat counterintuitive) finding in a recently published article from Bahel et al. (2022) is that communication may lead to less cooperation in the Golden Balls Game in populations that value honesty more. In this study we test this finding empirically with the help of controlled laboratory experiments. In addition, we investigate to what extent behaviour in the Golden Balls Game is correlated with various personality traits at the individual level."
