abstract: "Intimate partner violence (IPV) prevention programming worldwide has traditionally centered on providing victim assistance, greater awareness of legal rights, and changing social norms, relying solely on women’s participation and action, while men have largely been excluded from prevention efforts.

'Hablemos entre Patas' (HEP) is a men-focused IPV prevention intervention delivered by trained male hosts to a group of 50 men via WhatsApp, an instant messaging application. Over 30 days, each host facilitates discussion on masculine norms and shares daily behavioral and skill-building challenges to improve relationship dynamics, reduce violence, and change men’s attitudes towards violence against women.

HEP is designed to impact the following outcomes: 1) men's understanding of consensual sex and communication with female partners about sex; 2) men's emotional regulation and communication skills to control violent behaviors, communicate and resolve conflict; and 3) men's knowledge and skills to communicate on finances and shared household management and reduced conflict over finances. Through discrete (virtual) interactions in groups with other men, HEP offers men a community of like-minded men who are also seeking to improve their relationships. The group offers space and social support for men to challenge each other to change attitudes, confront patriarchal norms, and ultimately change their behavior.

The main analyses of the experiment take place at the couple level; therefore, only partnered men are eligible to participate. We will conduct phone surveys (baseline and endline) to men participants and their female partners. IPV and other IPV-related outcomes will be measure from female partners' reponses."
