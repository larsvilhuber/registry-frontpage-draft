abstract: "In this project, we tend to investigate the impact of service robot on employee's labor supply, customers' satisfaction, as well as firm performance. We conduct the RCT in a hotel in Shanghai, China. We randomly select roughly 50% of the rooms in this hotel, and then we intall a voice robot in the room. This voice robot can finish many tasks which the customers used to rely on the help from hotel staffs. We already started to collect relevant data before the installment of the voice robot. We will also plan to collect data after the installment of the voice robot. Using the detailed data we collect, we can then investigate the impact of the voice robot on different outcome variables. "
