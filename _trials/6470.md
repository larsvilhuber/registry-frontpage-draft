abstract: "This research seeks to assess the impact of customer feedback on firm performance and understand the mechanism of that impact. Both academic researchers as well as industry practitioners recognize that the voice of the customer is a powerful tool which businesses can wield in order to enhance their performance. However, very little is known about the business impact of listening to customers. We conduct a randomized controlled field experiment in Rwanda in order to study the impact of customer feedback on a sample of small entrepreneurs. We hypothesize that customer feedback could operate through two broad mechanisms â€“ (1) just the act of seeking feedback could change the utility of the customer, or (2) the feedback causes firms to improve the products and services they offer, which in-turn changes the utility the customer derives from the firm. Our study aims at teasing apart these two effects, with clear implications for firm policy."
