abstract: "We study the effects of complexity and market centralization in a land trading game. The game involves groups of 18 participants in villages in Masaka, Uganda. Participants are endowed with game currency and a set of artificial land plots on a "map", and trade plots among themselves to earn returns. They earn returns if they improve the efficiency of the land allocation in the game, which can be achieved by sorting higher "ability" players to better plots and/or by consolidating fragmented plots into contiguous blocks.

Our treatment variations are
1. Map complexity: some maps are "simple" because there are many possible payoff-equivalent first-best allocations of plots. Some maps are "complex" because there are only a few. Complexity is varied by minimally altering maps to add non-trading plots. These decrease the number of possible ways to arrange contiguous blocks of plots into the map.

2. Trade centralization: trade is either "decentralized," with participants trading free-form among themselves within the village, or "centralized," taking place with all participants present in the same location at the same time. 

We will study the effects of these treatments on trading efficiency, measured by the share of possible gains from trade achieved in the game, and the distribution of those gains, measured by the log-utility Atkinson index of final payoffs."
