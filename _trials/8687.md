abstract: "The purpose of this research project is to identify how the provision of agricultural market information affects farmersâ€™ household income and psychological indicators (i.e., trust in outsiders). For this purpose, we conduct the experiment in Arsi zone, Ethiopia, targeting 16 Gores (villages), 559 households. 
In our experiment, we provide the market information of major crops (i.e., wheat, barley, and fava beans) to the households selected as the treatment group through Facebook. We have the two treatment groups which receive the information and the one control group. We randomly selected 10 Gores in total as the treatment groups: 5 Gores for each treatment group.
