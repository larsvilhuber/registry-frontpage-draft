abstract: "We use a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to assess whether either a simplified less intensive financial treatment or a tailored just-in-time financial treatment can perform better than traditional financial literacy education in overcoming financial inclusion barriers for a sample of young women in Bangladesh. The simplified less intensive financial treatment will entail participants self-recording daily income and expenditure using a financial diary. Financial diaries are believed to assist households to manage daily expenses, cut unnecessary expenditure and save for unforeseen expenses. The tailored just-in-time financial treatment will involve participants receiving individualized financial counselling, which will involve provision of advice on matters such as opening a bank account, obtaining credit and debt refinancing, tailored to the participantsâ€™ need.
