abstract: "The spread of obesity in developed nations over the past decades has disproportionally affected lower socioeconomic groups as they face a larger risk of overweight and obesity (McLaren, 2007). Among the factors suggested to cause this socioeconomic gradient in obesity are higher levels of stress and a lack of tools to cope with stressful situations among low socioeconomic groups (Moore and Cunningham, 2012). Eating more or eating foods high in fat and sugar might provide comfort in stressful times. Making healthy decisions may also be more difficult when the mind is occupied with handling stressful situations.

This study focuses on two main research questions:
(1) How does acute stress affect food choices in the context of immediate and planned consumption?
(2) How does in utero exposure to maternal stress affect the child’s future preferences for obesogenic and non-obesogenic foods?

To study these research questions we propose to conduct a lab experiment with approximately 200 low income mothers. Experimental sessions will be pre-assigned to a stress treatment group or to a control group. In the stress treatment, subjects will be asked to complete a 10 minute block of short incentivised decision tasks which is designed to mimic stressors often experienced by low-socioeconomic mothers: making decisions with consequences for others subject to financial and time constraints as well as distractions.

Following the stress or control task, subjects will be asked to use a fixed budget to purchase food items in a “virtual supermarket”, a computer-based tool similar to online supermarkets. For this food shopping task, sessions will be further pre-assigned to one of two food shopping environment treatments: a simple or a complex choice environment.

During a five minute break and during a questionnaire on demographics, participants are furthermore offered a choice of snacks involving high- and low-calorie snack foods. The nutritional content of the chosen food shopping basket and the quantity of snacks consumed will be used to determine the impact of acute stress on immediate and planned food consumption choices.

In addition to the randomly assigned acute stress and shopping environment treatments, our study will aim to capture chronic stress during pregnancy using a questionnaire on specific stressors and their perceived stressfulness. This measure will be used to estimate the impact of chronic stress during pregnancy on questionnaire-based measures of children’s food preferences.

We previously conducted a study with a similar design in Italy (AEARCTR-0003089)."
