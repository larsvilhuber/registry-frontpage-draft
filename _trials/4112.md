abstract: "Agriculture remains central for the livelihood of a large portion of the population in developing countries, employing nearly 60% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa and 750 million people in South Asia alone (World Bank, 2018). With increasing land fragmentation over time, increased agriculture productivity remains central to alleviating poverty. This project will run a randomized control trial to understand how the availability of formal rental markets for mechanization affects agricultural productivity, labor market outcomes and incomes for farmers, and on service prices and times to completion for local service providers.
