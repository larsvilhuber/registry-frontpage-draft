abstract: "This study investigates the impact of "consequence graphs" on decisions about insurance plans.  Participants in our experiments are presented with menus of health insurance options and randomized into different information treatments.  In the baseline treatment, participants see "feature-based" information about options, which describe contract features such as premiums, deductibles, and copays.  In our primary experimental treatment, participants either or in addition see a "consequence graph", which is a visual representation of the distribution of total financial consequences the individual could expect to have with a give plan.  In some of our trials there is a third experimentally assigned treatment condition which combines feature-based information with an expected-spending projection (i.e., projected average) but not the full distribution from the consequence graph.  For some of the menus there are dominant options and our primary outcome metric is the share choosing the dominant option under different information displays.  In some menus there is no dominant option and we instead investigate simply whether the information treatments lead to different distributions of choices.  "
