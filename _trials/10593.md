abstract: "This paper investigates the relative efficiency of traditional leaders when informally taxing citizens in low-income states and whether this comes at the expense of relatively poor households. I design a field experiment to measure whether citizens engage in costly actions to avoid contributing their labor to a public good. I randomize communities across different methods to select contributors to compare the status quo of chiefs selecting contributors to two alternatives: random lotteries and progressive selection based on household surveys. I use the random selection arm as a benchmark and estimate whether selection by chiefs or progressive selecting are relatively efficient by generating more or less costly behavior from citizens. I also study the heterogenous effects of these treatment arms by household wealth. This allows me to asses if chiefs appear regressive by mostly burdening poor households and whether this can be corrected by a simple policy instrument."
