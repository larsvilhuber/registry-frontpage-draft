abstract: "We have previously demonstrated that parent-training sessions conducted by government health workers, as part of their existing duties, in primary health care clinics in rural Bangladesh leads to large benefits to the level of stimulation in the home and to the development of disadvantaged young children. However, in previous studies, the research team trained and supervised the government workers. For the intervention to be implemented at scale, we need a feasible and effective model for the training and supervision of clinic health staff using the government supervisors and trainers.  In this feasibility study,  we evaluated the effectiveness of utilising government supervisors to train and supervise clinic staff to implement the intervention. We evaluated this approach using two measures: observed quality of parent-training sessions and the parenting practices of participating mothers. A key issue when integrating early childhood development programmes into existing services is that staff may be overburdened. Hence, we also measured burn-out among clinic staff.

The study was conducted in sixteen unions in rural Bangladesh. Eight unions (24 clinics) were randomly assigned to an intervention group and eight unions (24 clinics) to a control group. In intervention clinics, twenty-four mothers of children aged 6-36 months, living within a thirty minute walk from the clinic were invited to participate in fortnightly play sessions, delivered by government health staff in the clinic, in groups of four mother/child dyads. The effect of the play sessions was evaluated on the level of stimulation in the home by maternal report. The evaluation sample consisted of 384 mother/child dyads (192 intervention and 192 control). Burn out of health staff was also assessed in both intervention and control clinics. We also measured the quality of the parenting sessions in intervention clinics through observation."
