abstract: "Public health strategies to deal with pandemics, including Covid-19, are primarily guided by the principle of saving more lives. Public opposition towards the recommendations and directives of health authorities suggests that a sizeable fraction of the population may not subscribe to the same principle. Using a randomized controlled experiment, we examine whether providing information about the ethical considerations that guide public health strategies affects the individual preferences for saving more lives, and the likelihood of social agreement on this principle."
