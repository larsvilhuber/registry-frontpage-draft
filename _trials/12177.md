abstract: "We describe the analysis plan for an online intervention designed to examine the effects of exposure to historical narratives representing the views of different demographics on the political polarization of white Americans. Our protocol will also enable an exploratory analysis of the effects of these narratives on the political attitudes of African Americans. The study is a follow-up that builds on two previous rounds of data collection (AEARCTR-0009108 & AEARCTR-0011305), asking similar questions from a different set of participants recruited through a different platform (Dynata).
