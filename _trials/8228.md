abstract: "Many people, especially in Sub Saharan Africa, lack access to safe drinking water. Drinking water from unprotected sources causes diarrhoea and other waterborne diseases, which are a threat in the developing world. Improving access to safe drinking water is part of SDG6. Many NGOs and governments are involved in providing access, which facilitates clean water use, but research has pointed out that this does not always lead to improved drinking water quality at point of use. There are several reasons for this. One reason might be that beneficiaries don't take the water from the tap stand as they find it too expensive, while water from a stream or a lake is for free. The beneficiaries might also lack trust in the organisation realising the infrastructure or to the individuals exploiting the tap stand. Another reason could be that beneficiaries use the water from the tap stand, but as they trust this water too much, they pay less attention to hygiene and good sanitation practices after receiving the intervention. For instance if clean water and good sanitation practices are substitutes, then providing access to safe drinking water might worsen the situation. Drinking water might be carried or stored in dirty containers or mixed with water from other sources. Water from tap stands might also take longer to collect, if the tap stand is further away from the house than the existing water source. 
This study investigates the impact of the provision of communal tap stands on point of use drinking water quality in Western Uganda (Kitagwenda District). In the area the inhabitants use mostly lake water, water from shallow wells or hand dug wells for their water provision. The intervention involves the construction of two extensions of an existing water pipeline, finished by the end of November 2021. Collective tap stands will provide access to safe drinking water to around 2400 people (around 500 households). Enumerators (students from a local university) will visit a total of 361 households. They will let several household members take a survey and collect drinking water samples POU (at the household level) before and after intervention in treatment and control villages. These samples will be analysed on a number of characteristics (E.coli, total coliforms and turbidity), but our main focus is E.coli. 
Data collection will take place twice, once in September-October 2021 (before installation) and once in January-February 2022 (when treatment villages received the intervention and control villages did not yet)."
