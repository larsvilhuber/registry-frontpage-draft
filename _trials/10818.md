abstract: "Primary education enrollment rates in developing countries have increased significantly over the past few decades, but secondary school completion rates still lag far behind. This study presents the findings of a randomized controlled trial I conducted in Benin investigating the effects of providing parents with information about their role in their child’s education through weekly phone calls. Including 2,094 8th-grade
students in 20 secondary schools, the intervention led to a substantial 6 percent increase in grade completion. This stems from a statistically significant 0.11 standard deviation increase in year-end GPA, driven by STEM subjects. The intervention benefits academically weaker students, elevating their likelihood of progression by 33 percent. Educational improvements are due to heightened parental awareness regarding their child’s academic performance, augmented parental involvement at school and home, and reductions in household child chores. These results offer a promising and extremely cost-effective strategy to improve educational outcomes."
