abstract: "The introductory economics courses serve as a gateway to many students in the university experience, most of whom may have never considered having economics declared as a major. This experience is especially true for students from underrepresented backgrounds. This research adds to the current literature by directly investigating the effectiveness of light-touch nudge intervention on the increase in the number of students who declare economics as a major or minor. In addition, we contribute by investigating how the nudge emails affect the socioeconomic and racial diversity of undergraduate Economics. Finally, we investigate the impact of students receiving an email nudging those who performed well in the introductory level economics courses to become Economics majors. We will randomly select students who perform well with an A or B grade in the introductory economics courses to be part of a treatment and control group of students who receive the email nudge from the economics department. The introductory economics courses are ECON 2100 – Global Economy, ECON 2105 – Principles of Macroeconomics, and ECON 2106 – Principles of Microeconomics. "
