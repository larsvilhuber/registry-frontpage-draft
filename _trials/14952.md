abstract: "Artificial intelligence, in particular Large Language Models (LLMs), are commonly considered being a path-breaking innovation. While possible applications and rising research questions are manifold, one straightforward question of very general interest is whether LLMs can support humans in fulfilling job-related tasks, hereby improving the quality and quantity of the output. In this study, we will focus on the impact of LLM and LLM training on teachers in adult education. To this end, we design an experimental study in which we ask participants to complete four tasks typical for teaching preparation and communication with course participants. We vary both access to an assisting LLM as well as being trained in the use of LLMs before completing the tasks. This will provide insights about whether and to what extend adult education teachers can profit from the use of LLMs or being trained in their use to improve the quality of teaching material and/or increase the efficiency in teaching preparation.
