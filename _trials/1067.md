abstract: "This study evaluates a community intervention to facilitate depression treatment and provide economic assistance to women in peri-urban communities near Bangalore.  Participants in the intervention receive depression treatment and placement and employment opportunities. We randomize these components in a “two-by-two” design, which will allow us to assess the impact of depression treatment and economic assistance both separately and jointly. We will measure impacts on mental health, time use, risk and time preferences, and child investment over four and eight months.
