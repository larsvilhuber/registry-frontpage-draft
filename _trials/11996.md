abstract: "We study the perception of tail risks in a large sample of representative households. This study extends a previous RCT registered under the ID AEARCTR-0009917 (results available at https://www.johannes-beutel.com). In this new RCT we are particularly interested in the role of related memories, and the role of seemingly unrelated personal experiences for tail probabilities and magnitudes. Most of this wave is framed in terms of stock market crashes. "
