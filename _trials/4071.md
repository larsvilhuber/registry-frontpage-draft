abstract: "This study uses an experimental approach to examine two research questions related to mosquito awareness campaigns. 

(1) How much does a one-on-one awareness campaign increase the knowledge about the proliferation of mosquitos, mosquito transferable diseases and prevention possibilities and how much does it not only changes the knowledge but also induces behavioral changes. 
(2) To what extent can additional text message reminders about the content of the awareness campaign augment the knowledge-levels and increase behavioral changes towards the prevention of mosquito proliferation. 

The study was developed in partnership with IRESO e.V., Rotary Rio de Janeiro and Redes da Mare.
