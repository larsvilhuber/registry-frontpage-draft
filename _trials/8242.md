abstract: "The South African Department of Basic Education has tested interventions such as scripted lesson plans, teacher training and coaching to improve reading proficiency in learners taught in African home languages by teachers in under resourced schools. The EGRS I was an RCT implemented between 2015 and 2017 which tested three interventions: Treatment 1: Training, scripted lessons, graded readers, Treatment 2: Reading Coaches, scripted lessons, graded readers, Treatment 3: Parental involvement Programme. The EGRS I impact evaluation showed that the coaching treatment resulted in statistically significant improvements in African Home Language reading proficiency. A 2019 sustainability assessment of the EGRS I,  indicated that reading proficiency gains were sustained after learners were no longer taught by supported teachers. In response to these encouraging findings, the Reading Support Programme was implemented to test whether a similar intervention can be implemented on a larger scale. The RSP involved all Foundation Phase teachers for two years (The EGRS I targeted one grade’s teachers per annum and provided one year’s support), and delivered the intervention in both Setswana Home Language as well as English First Additional Language (The EGRS I only provided support in Setswana Home Language). Similar to the EGRS, the RSP was designed to test if there were any reading proficiency gains in schools that benefitted from teacher training and scripted lessons, and there was a differential gain in those schools that also benefitted from literacy coaching support and those that benefitted from a leadership development intervention targeted at School Management Team members.  

This 2021 impact evaluation will investigate 1) The impact of EGRS interventions on a cohort of learners tracked for six years from the beginning of Grade 1 (on interventions that ended in either Grade 2 or Grade 3). 2) The impact of RSP interventions (and Classroom Library Program) on a cohort of learners tracked for two years from Grade 1. 3) The impact of RSP interventions (and Classroom Library Program) on learners in Grade 4 in 2021. 4) The impact of both EGRS and RSP on a cohort of learners tracked for two years from Grade 1.

This is a continuation of the Early Grade Reading Study in South Africa, 2016, RCT ID AEARCTR-0001749.
