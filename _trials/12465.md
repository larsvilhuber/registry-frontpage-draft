abstract: "This study implements a randomized correspondence study to estimate the callback rate and wage differential for remote work by sex, race, education, experience, and geography. To identify causal estimates of the returns (positive or negative) to remote workers, I create fictitious worker profiles on an online job board where the demographics, qualifications, and preferences for remote work of each worker are randomly selected. I plan to test whether job seekers who prefer working from home receive fewer interviews and are paid less on average. In addition, I am interested in how the returns to working from home varies by worker and firm characteristics, particularly whether remote work creates job opportunities for women and for workers in less populated areas."
