abstract: "We examine the flagship crop insurance scheme offered by the Indian government: Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY). We embed experimental variation into efforts to enroll farmers in this program, allowing us to shed light on the consequences of this agricultural insurance, the diffusion of information about the program within villages, and the relationship between informal risk sharing and formal insurance take-up."
