abstract: "The RCT tests whether subjective well-being depends on the comparison group people implicitly refer to when they answer questions on satisfaction in different life domains (job, health, household income, leisure and life overall). The RCT prompts some respondents to compare themselves with people of the same gender, education, gender and education, and leaves the reference group of others unconstrained. The RCT is part of the wave 5 of Understanding society Innovation Panel (IP5).  The randomization was obtained using random draws from an uniform distribution and was balanced by mode protocol, incentive and the wave 5 web invite experiment of the Understanding Society Innovation Panel. The planned sample size is around 580 individuals per treatment arm."
