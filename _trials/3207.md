abstract: "Many developing countries struggle with building foundation math skills. We plan to conduct a two-year randomized evaluation of a promising math curriculum for primary school called JUMP Math in grades 1 and 3 in Santiago, Chile. The curriculum combines learning and teaching materials with teacher training and a specific pedagogy for teaching math in primary school. Specifically, it includes three main components: (a) it breaks down long learning units into shorter, more manageable, units that students can understand; (b) it ensures that students master a given unit before moving on to the next one; and (c) it provides students with feedback through ongoing formative assessment.
