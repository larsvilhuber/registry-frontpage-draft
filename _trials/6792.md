abstract: "The registered study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) implemented to assess the impact of a participatory agricultural extension program that aims to promote sustainable farming in rural China. We conduct this RCT in 135 villages, which are mainly grain farming villages in the North China Plain. Using detailed panel data, we explore if the program improves rural smallholdersâ€™ agricultural and environmental outcomes."
