abstract: "Together with Pratham, one of the largest NGOs in India, we evaluated whether a mothers’ literacy program could encourage parental involvement and subsequently improve children’s learning outcomes. Mothers of children aged 5-8 years-old were assigned to one of the following three treatment groups or a comparison group, which received no additional services.

1. Mothers’ Literacy Classes (ML) were held for two hours every day.
2. Child’s Home Activities and Materials Packet (CHAMP) was intended to help illiterate mothers interact with their children to enrich the learning environment at home. Children were given workbooks with a specific activity assigned for each day and mothers were instructed on how to facilitate their child's use the workbooks.
3. A combination of ML and CHAMP. 

Both mothers and their children were tested at the start of the intervention and again one year later (after the intervention) on basic literacy and numeracy. A household survey collected data on demographics, asset ownership, schooling status of children in the household, mother perceptions of education, mother empowerment, as well as mother and child time use.
