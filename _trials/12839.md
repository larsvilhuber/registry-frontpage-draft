abstract: "This pre-registration outlines the collection of new data and the formulation of additional hypotheses for our intervention study of the Lions Quest Skills for Growing (LQ SfG) program in elementary schools in Bangladesh. While the previous pre-registration (AEARCTR-0003129) and data collection aimed at describing our analysis of the short-term effects of the intervention on students’ socio-emotional development, this pre-registration considers effects of the intervention on teachers’ teaching style and their beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors with respect to teaching. 

In the initial study, using an RCT in a sample of more than 3,000 children attending 135 schools, we assess the direct effectiveness of the LQ SfG program. LQ SfG is a school-based social and emotional learning (SEL) program that was taught in grades 2 to 5 of 69 randomly assigned elementary schools in Bangladesh during the academic year 2019 with specific lessons on, e.g., self-discipline, impulse-control, goal-setting, working cooperatively, empathy, perspective-taking, and self-confidence. The program is characterized by interactive and diverse teaching with example stories, open discussions, role plays, and group work. 

Besides assessing LQ SfG’s  effect on children’s socio-emotional skills such as self-control or prosociality, we also measure elementary school children’s educational performance by official school exam results in six subjects and by achievement test scores in Bengali and math. 

Collected data on children’s skills and behaviors as well as first evidence from preliminary teacher surveys directly following the intervention suggest that teachers and an enhanced teaching style may play a role in explaining positive treatment effects on school exams and achievement test scores. The initial surveys covered only information on teachers’ socio demographics (age, gender, education, and experience), their absences, their attitudes towards teaching in a brief, rather ad-hoc manner and, for LQ teachers, their identification with the program and possible implementation problems they came across. To follow up on this, we will collect from our 135 sample schools and from teachers who taught at these schools during the intervention period a) refined matching data to link teachers to students (we currently only know whether students and teachers attended the same school in 2019 but not whether a specific teacher taught a specific student), b) measures of teaching style, beliefs, attitudes, behaviors, and personality, c) general information on schooling during the past Covid-19 pandemic years, and d) if feasible, pre-treatment and further post-treatment school exam results. 

With these additional data, we plan to investigate the role of teachers and whether teaching style is related to both the intervention and children’s educational attainment. By improved knowledge of the matching of teachers to the students they taught, we can use individual-level teacher data instead of aggregates at school level which we are restricted to with our current data base.

The new data collection will start mid-January/beginning of February 2024.
