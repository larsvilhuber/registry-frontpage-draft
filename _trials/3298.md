abstract: "We conduct a randomized controlled experiment in which randomly selected female workers in Bangladeshi garment factories will be given access to free menstrual health classes and free disposable menstrual pads to manage their period. Recent studies indicate that no more than 40 percent of garment workers in Bangladesh regularly use hygienic menstrual pads to manage their menstruation. We want to study the effects of this intervention on workerâ€™s well-being, health, and productivity, and whether such an intervention would yield a positive return if financed by the factories. We furthermore want to shed light on how common health taboos, such as those still surrounding menstrual health in many countries, affect the effectiveness of health interventions in providing health information, behaviour change and health technology adoption."
