abstract: "In this research, we study causal impacts of interventions which provide information on oral health, especially how to prevent periodontal disease. By conducting online surveys and providing information on prevention and treatment of periodontal disease to randomly selected individuals, we aim to study whether and how people change their perception/behavior on oral health.The third survey asks respondents the same set of questions plus new questions to see whether the intervention persist or not."
