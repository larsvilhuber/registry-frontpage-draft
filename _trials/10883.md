abstract: "The experiment will be conducted with a leading travel company and tour operator in Germany. The firm sells its products online but also through a large number of mostly independently owned travel agencies. These travel agencies work together with several tour operators and the respective tour operators pay the agencies through commissions typically set once a year. Common commission payments are defined as percentages of sales.

We study whether there is a difference between giving top-up payments (made for bookings to specific target destination) to the agency owner or the team of agents (through travel vouchers)."
