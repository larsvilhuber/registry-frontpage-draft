abstract: "Continuing education beyond the compulsory years of schooling is one of the most important choices
an adolescent has to make; higher education is associated with a host of social and economic benefits both
for the person and its community. Today, there is ample evidence that educational aspirations are an
important determinant of said choice. We implement a multilevel, networked experiment in 45 Mexican
high schools, and provide evidence of the malleability of educational aspirations, and the interdependence
of students’ choices and the effect of our intervention with peer networks. Moreover, we find that a video-
intervention, which combines role-models and information about returns to education, is successful in
updating students’ beliefs and consequently educational aspirations."
