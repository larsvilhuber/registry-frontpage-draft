abstract: "In this study, we work with one of the fastest-growing microfinance institutions in Pakistan to conduct a field experiment where we offer a relatively large amount of financing to microenterprise owners who have graduated from small-scale borrowing and expressed an interest in financing a fixed asset for their business. We use a shared-ownership contract to finance the purchase of the asset. "
