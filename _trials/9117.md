abstract: "The project examines the impact of information on prospects in working life - in terms of opportunities for professional reorientation. Randomly drawn individuals receive information and an access link to the Federal Employment Agency's online exploration tool New Plan - Inspirieren. New Plan - Inspirieren is designed to actively support people in their search for career reorientation opportunities. To this end, information on alternative occupations, such as earning potential, employment opportunities and job availability, is provided in a clear and individually tailored manner."
