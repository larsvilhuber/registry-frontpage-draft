abstract: "In recent decades, labor markets in OECD countries have experienced profound changes driven by digitalization, globalization and demographic shifts. Despite the widespread acknowledgment that training plays a vital role in supporting workers through these transformations, we have limited knowledge on the demand for training and reskilling among jobseekers. This project gathers new survey data and runs a discrete choice experiment to quantify the demand for training and reskilling among Italian jobseekers. Through simulations, we will also compare the effect of alternative policies on participation  in training and reskilling. By identifying and understanding the barriers faced by our participants, we aim to propose effective measures tailored to their needs and to provide valuable insights into the design of policies that can foster the successful reallocation of workers into high-growth sectors.
We collect our survey on two different samples. The first sample is recruited through a survey company, which sent out our invitation to their registered users in order to have a sample representative of Italian unemployed. The second sample consists of jobseekers registered to job-centres in the metropolitan city of Milan."
