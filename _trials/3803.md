abstract: "Collaboration plays an important role in innovative progress. Working together would likely result in better ideas which bring about greater innovation performance. Which factors would promote collaboration? In this project we focus on the role of social identity  (Chen at al., 2009, 2011) as a main factor to induce collaboration among immigrants. Following are the research questions:

1.	Are individuals are more likely to collaborate with others from their own or related ethnics?
2.	Are individuals from minority ethnics likely to work on their own or try to collaborate with those from other majority?
3.	Will groups consist of individuals from mixed ethnicities?"
