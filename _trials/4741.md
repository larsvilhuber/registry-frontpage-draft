abstract: "Our research project focuses on individual preferences for cooperation. It addresses the questions where differences in cooperative behavior stem from and whether and how preferences for cooperation can be influenced. We analyze how the particular style and content of social interaction between teachers and children shape cooperative attitudes on a day-to-day basis within the context of primary education using a randomized controlled trial. In our treatment, coaches providing afternoon childcare at our partner schools engage children in a broad variety of group games and activities explicitly featuring the experience of well-functioning cooperation for a period of eight to nine weeks. The project aims at measuring short- and long-run effects of the treatment and investigating underlying mechanisms."
