abstract: "Most rural areas in Sub-Saharan Africa have underperforming schools and tend to also be energy poor. As a result, solar lanterns have recently been promoted across the region to improve both lighting in homes and educational outcomes. We undertake a randomized controlled trial in Zimba District, Zambia, to evaluate whether solar lanterns help children study more effectively and improve academic performance. We find no evidence that receipt of a solar lantern improved performance on important national examinations (even though an ex post statistical power analysis demonstrates that our research design should detect economically significant impacts, if present). We also do not observe impacts on self-reported study habits. Several features of Zimba District that are likely to exist in other developing regions appear to drive our results. First, flashlights have become the dominant lighting source in rural Zambia rather than traditional options like kerosene lamps or candles. In such environments, solar lights may hold only limited appeal for prospective users. Second, our survey data suggests that other major barriers to educational attainment likely render improved energy access (whether through solar lanterns or otherwise) a relatively unimportant educational input.
