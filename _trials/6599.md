abstract: "Experiments are often replicated in discrimination research. These replication studies are a necessary means of checking and confirming effects. With this motivation we want to replicate a study by Butler and Broockman (2011) on discrimination against blacks in the light of the approaching US election campaign.
Butler and Broockmann (2011) investigated the effect of the first and last name of a person who makes a request to “his" or "her" MP. The representatives of the US citizens are known as so-called 'State Legislators'. The 'State Legislators' are current members of the Lower Chamber (State Assembly, House of Representatives etc.) or the Upper Chamber (Senate) of a US state. Following the experimental design of Butler and Broockman (2011), inquiries were made to these 'State Legislators'. The inquiries were sent by two different people with fictitious first and last names, which, according to the US census, are very likely to be “black” or “white”. The request was for information on how to register to vote. With the help of these name signals, politicians can be put in the position of responding to inquiries from different US citizens. If the request is answered, this is an indication of responsiveness. The time it takes to receive a response can also be examined.
Study design
We want to use the same design during the US election campaign. To do this, we use an experimental survey to investigate whether the race of the inquirer has an influence on whether and how quickly the addressees respond to inquiries from these two inquirers. By varying the inquirer, we achieve an experimental character, just as Butler and Broockman (2011) and many other studies from political science have presented: While the name 'Matthew Mueller' can be connected with a white, the name 'Deshawn Jackson 'more likely to be associated with a black. We want to use these names and ask about the prevalence of police violence in each constituency.
