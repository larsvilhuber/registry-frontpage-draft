abstract: "We intend to conduct a large in-person survey in rural India to understand the determinants of vaccine hesitancy amongst a primarily unvaccinated sample. Our study will be conducted in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, with an exclusive focus on data collection from rural areas. Our survey will empirically estimate demand for the vaccine, the determinants of this demand or the lack thereof, and hurdles due to supply-side issues. We will also collect information about knowledge related to COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines, adherence to COVID-19 protective measures, media consumption and demographics to serve as covariates in our analysis. In addition to the survey, we also intend to test behaviourally informed communications interventions that we hypothesise could improve vaccine agency amongst our sample. Our sample size will be about 6000 respondents and roughly representative of the rural population of each state."
