abstract: "This project investigates the transition from female secondary school students in Tanzania to the labor market, with a special focus on the issue of sexual harassment in the workplace and during the job search process. We utilize an experimental approach to assess the impact of work training programs on job seekers in Tanzania. This aims to address the challenges of poor job quality, workplace conditions, and the skills gap that hinder poverty reduction and productivity growth. By enrolling around 400 secondary school graduates and employing a combination of lab experiments and field evidence, the research seeks to understand the psychological mechanisms behind job search and career choices, and the effect of interventions on job satisfaction, gender equality, and poverty."
