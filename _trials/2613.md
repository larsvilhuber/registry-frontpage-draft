abstract: "The U.S is overall a rich country, yet since high-income individuals hold such a great percentage of the wealth, there is still a great deal of poverty and unemployment. Because of this inequality, recent literature in economics has explored how generous individuals are, as this information could be important to understanding how to better distribute the countryâ€™s wealth. We propose an experiment that manipulates people's perceptions of how their peers have generated income - either by fortuitous circumstances or from effortful work - in order to observe the impact that this socioeconomic judgement has on donation behavior. We implement a Qualtrics survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk in which participants engage in either a simple luck-based or labor-based task and then are given the opportunity to donate some of their earnings to individuals in a so-described "lower income bracket." We aim to establish how generous individuals are based on their knowledge of others' wages and then see how this decision changes when information about the task that they performed is made known. "
