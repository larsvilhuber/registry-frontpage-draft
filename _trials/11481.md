abstract: "We study the effect of improvements in urban drainage infrastructure for flood prevention on affected households with a survey in Barishal, Bangladesh. Specifically, our project analyzes the socio-economic and behavioral effects of drainage improvements on affected households. Improvements in drainage systems are a key component for flood control and climate change adaptation in many urban settings around the globe. We will use a spatial regression discontinuity design with the distance to the boundaries of the area benefiting from the project as a running variable. We will complement this analysis with a grid-cell level analysis on the likelihood and length of experiencing a flooding event during the rainy season using satellite imagery as an objective measure of risk exposure."
