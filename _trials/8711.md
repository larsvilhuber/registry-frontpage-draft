abstract: "This study will distribute videos of health care professionals encouraging Covid-19 vaccination to a large sample of Facebook users, and will test the most effective ways to maximize diffusion of this vaccine-related content to increase vaccination rates. The study sample will be U.S. states where vaccination rates remained low in fall 2021. The experimental design is an RCT with 4 groups, randomized at the county level: 1) a control group which receives no intervention, 2) a treatment group in which Facebook users receive ads which include videos of health care professionals telling them to get vaccinated, 3) a treatment group in which Facebook users receive ads which include videos of health care professionals encouraging them to help their friends to get vaccinated, and 4) a treatment group in which Facebook users receive ads which include videos of health care professionals encouraging them to get their most influential friends to help their friends get vaccinated. In treatments 3 and 4, participants will have the option to sign up to be a "vaccine ambassador," in which case they will get notifications when the study team posts new vaccine-related content, and will receive reminders about encouraging their friends to be vaccinated. The study team is building a website to host the videos of health care professionals which answer common questions about Covid-19 vaccination. The investigators will measure engagement with vaccine-related content in each treatment group, as well as assess effects on vaccination rates. Other outcomes which may be considered include Covid-19 case and symptoms prevalence, Covid-19 hospitalization or mortality, and outcomes related to movement, travel, and closures."
