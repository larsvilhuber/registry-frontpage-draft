abstract: "In response to the myriad challenges students are facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many universities have modified their academic policies to provide more flexibility for students. During the 2020-2021 academic year, the University of Michigan (UM) adopted a policy that gives students the option to convert letter grades to “Pass” or “No Record Covid” and also to drop courses late in the term without it appearing on their official transcript. This policy should reduce the risk associated with poor course performance and permit students to attempt more challenging courses without fear that it will adversely affect their grades. 

We will use this setting to better understand the role that grading systems play in students’ course selection, major choice, and other academic behaviors. Using a survey of UM undergraduates, we will solicit information about students’ beliefs about grades and knowledge of the new and old grading policy. In an experimental intervention embedded within the survey, some students will receive additional information highlighting how the grading policy reduces the risk of taking more difficult and more varied courses. We will combine survey responses with administrative student records to see whether making salient the insurance aspect of the policy changes students’ attitudes towards coursetaking, intended academic behavior, and realized academic decisions.
