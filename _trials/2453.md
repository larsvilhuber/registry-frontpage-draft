abstract: "We present experimental evidence on the added value of performance management training and tools for school principals and supervisors, over and above information on student achievement. We randomly assigned 100 public primary schools in the province of Salta, Argentina to: (a) a control group, in which we administered standardized tests in math and Spanish at baseline and two follow-ups and made the results available to the schools through user-friendly reports; or (b) a treatment group, in which we did the same and also provided principals with training on how to develop a school improvement plan, a web-based dashboard to track progress on that plan, and two workshops to support their work."
