abstract: "The study explores the political careers of backbenchers in UK Parliament, seeking to understand why some progress and others do not. The survey experiment looks in particular at the extent of knowledge each politician has about his/her peers, in the aim of testing the hypothesis that Parliament is (in some sense) actually an information-weak environment."
