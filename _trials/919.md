abstract: "In the context of low and middle-income countries, health finance reforms have been receiving more attentions in recent times. Health insurance can address many of the health financing issues specially for the poor because a well designed and managed health insurance scheme can effectively deal with loss of efficiency and lack of equity associated with absence of such risk-pooling schemes. In this study, we attempt to understand the impacts of introducing a health security scheme that aims to insure low-skilled workers of a large semi-formal employer in Bangladesh. The scheme offers to cover for health care costs that can run up to twice as much the median monthly household income for the targeted beneficiar-ies. The scheme is mandatory for all the workers (including the low level manag-ers) with a nominal monthly premium collected from the workers with an equal contribution from the employer. The scheme will be introduced to randomly se-lected sub-centers, which employ the workers in groups of about 20 to 25. The random introduction will allow us to identify the impacts of the health insurance scheme on health seeking behavior, total and out-of-pocket expenditure and some labor market outcomes (such as workersâ€™ absenteeism and productivity) as well as school attendance of the children who are also covered under the scheme. The evaluation will involve comparing before and after treatment information as well as cross-sectional analysis. Separate qualitative analyses will be carried out to inform both the researchers and implementation partners to come up with better and more innovative designs of the scheme in future."
