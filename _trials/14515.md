abstract: "We are collaborating with a restaurant chain in Germany. This company offers a diverse range of beverage and food products across its numerous restaurants throughout the country. A significant challenge faced by the company is employee theft, specifically waiters accepting payment from customers without properly recording the transaction in the cashier system. In our field experiment, we will implement a randomized peer-monitoring measure within these restaurants. Specifically, in the treated restaurants, the group of individuals involved in processing a particular order is expanded. If these products are not properly recorded in the cashier system, it will now involve other colleagues, preventing the waiter from concealing the transaction. Additionally, we will conduct an employee survey to collect data aimed at identifying the underlying behavioral mechanisms."
