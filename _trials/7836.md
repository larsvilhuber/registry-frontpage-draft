abstract: "Learning to forecast experiments aim to find evidence on whether subjects can learn a rational expectations equilibrium. Experimental results often report substantial swings in prices due to adaptive learning processes or trend extrapolation strategies. We aim to explore whether Theory of Mind - in our case, the degree to which participants correctly assess information and signals in markets - helps to explain deviations from rational expectations equilibrium and the existence of price swings. We hypothesize that groups consisting of subjects who score high in a Theory of Mind test get closer to the rational expectations equilibrium showing lower price swings than groups consisting of subjects who score low. In line with Corgnet et al. (2018), we assume that high Theory of Mind subjects better assess the precision of signals in the markets and thus are better at making forecasts. To test our research question, we compare the price deviation from the fundamental value and the coordination of price forecasts in markets with different Theory of Mind levels, elicited via the eye gaze test (Baron-Cohen et al. 1997)
