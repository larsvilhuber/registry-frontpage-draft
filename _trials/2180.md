title: "Charitable giving trials linked to ESSExLab recruiting and omnibus: i. Crowding out (does one contribution/appeal come at the expense of another?) ii. Do people commit more before a win (conditionally on winning) or after a win? iii. Does the opportunity to donate boost reported happiness (and vice/versa). Associated instrument: Beliefs and attitudes towards starting salaries. [Registered later (but before 30 July implementation): Further trials via the Prolific platform (30 July, 1 August 2017)]"

abstract: "This is a field experiment in the context of a recruitment drive for the ESSExLab (University of Essex, Colchester). A sample of local participants, drawn from a marketing database, are being paid to join the ESSExLab database as participants, and again to take the Omnibus survey. A sample of already-registered ESSExLab participants (henceforth "Student subjects", although a small share of these are university staff and local residents) are also being paid to take the Omnibus, and again to take an Employability survey. Within these contexts we are running experiments into charitable giving following our previous research, and related research by other authors.

- "Substitution Among Charitable Contributions: An Experimental Study.‚Äù (Reinstein)

The employability study contains another embedded experiment about gender-differences in perceptions of starting salaries.


Further details are given within the hidden section.

The motivation for the substitution experiment and the broad design are also presented in

"Full_proposal_adapting_LOI_SPI_Reinstein_et_al with timeline.pdf", our 2013 grant application, and again in our BA grant application
