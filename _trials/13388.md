abstract: "Notions of rest and self-care – be it meditation, napping, or a walk in nature – have become increasingly popular, and recent economic research suggests these activities can improve not only mental well-being but also performance overall. Nevertheless, uptake and engagement of these kinds of activities remain low – especially in stressful labor market situations. In the context of online labor markets, we explore workers’ beliefs on and decisions to invest in rest. We document the productivity effects of mandated rest periods during a strenuous work task. Furthermore, we look at who chooses to invest in rest when given the option and ask whether “break-skippers” and “break-takers” are maximizing their earnings."
