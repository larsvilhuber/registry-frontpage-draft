abstract: "We implement a randomized controlled trial (RCT) experiment in a rural County of Hunan Province, China. Our RCT consists of two treatments. First, we give an online learning resource to a randomly selected 60 schools (112 classes) out of pool of about 100 schools. Second, we also randomly select half of the first treatment group schools and half of the control schools to receive our second treatment: a performance award (a certificate issued by local Education Bureau to be openly displayed in the classroom). The performance award is given to students achieving the highest exam marks in math and Chinese and also those making the greatest improvement in exam marks. So our RCT intends to see what are the separate and also combined effects of online learning (e-learning) and performance award. We will also consider various individual heterogenous effects. In particular, we want to see if there are significant differences in the treatment effects for those left-behind and non-left-behind children.      "
