abstract: "This research project explores the impact of Catholic Relief Services peace-building activities in Northern Ghana with a particular emphasis on their Youth Ambassador Program.  We ask: what was the effect of CRS 2016 Peacebuilding activities on social cohesion, youth participation, and violence reduction?  Secondly we explore trust and social cohesion across various social division: ethnicity, youth/elder, gender, and farmer/herder groups.  We employ surveys and experimental games as well as interviews and focus group with stakeholders in 21 program-affected communities and 21 matched pair locations.  We note that this study was not conducted as an RCT and that we are building control communities post hoc.  Due to some intervention activities - like radio broadcast - it is possible that control communities may have been exposed to some aspects of the treatment.
