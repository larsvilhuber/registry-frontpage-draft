abstract: "Rural entrepreneurs in India commonly suffer from access gaps that prevent linkage to larger metropolitan area opportunities. These access gaps exist despite the recent proliferation of mobile internet infrastructure. Bridging these gaps therefore requires tools that go beyond the simple availability of resources, and are affordable/self-sustaining. To this end, our objective is to demonstrate how current internet-based social technologies can be used to build a social knowledge management framework. We posit that this framework will enhance the knowledge capability of rural entrepreneurs, which in turn will positively affect entrepreneurial competency and performance. Our intervention is targeted towards artisans in Birbhum, West Bengal, and will involve enhancing digital literacy along several axes with hands on training as well as asynchronous material shared via Whatsapp-based communities. In a pre-intervention pilot study, we are able to successfully form active Whatsapp communities with a group of artisans and onboard them to use a digital storefront (ncore.co.in). Using survey instruments on this pilot sample, we first develop reliable scales for measuring the key constructs. Next, we see that knowledge capability strongly correlates with entrepreneurial competency, which in turn correlates with performance. This suggests that any intervention targeted at enhancing capabilities can have positive trickle down effects. Our intervention is now being deployed in the field as a 50-week stepped-wedge RCT for impact assessment. As “social intermediaries”, we aim to facilitate re-tooling and community building, both of which can be self-sustaining and have the potential to bring concrete socio-economic benefits even after the intervention. In general, our findings can have large scale policy implications for bottom of pyramid (BOP) entrepreneurs by identifying mechanisms through which digital knowledge management tools can lead to greater entrepreneurial success in emerging markets."
