abstract: "The purpose of this project is to investigate if communication by a group leader can increase contributions to a public good by the other group members if the communicated information is unverifiable and incentives between the leader and members are misaligned. This is to experimentally approximate the environment of informational autocracy (Guriev and Treisman, 2019, 2020) while abstracting from the existence of motivated beliefs and identity."
