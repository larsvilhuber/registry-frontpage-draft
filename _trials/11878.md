abstract: "This study elicits consumers' WTP for microalgae-based food products. The elicitation format varies between subjects whether WTP is elicited via the BDM mechanism or Discrete choice (Yes/No) questions. No incentives are provided and subjects are aware that elicitation is hypothetical. We also vary between-subjects the type of food product (milk vs. beer)."
