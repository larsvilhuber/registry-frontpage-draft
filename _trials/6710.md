abstract: "How are public attitudes towards trade shaped by rhetoric and messaging, both in favor and against increased trade with other countries? Rodriguez Chatruc, Stein, and Vlaicu (2020) found that Latin Americans were very sensitive to negative information regarding potential job losses associated to trade. Positive framings highlighting trade benefits in terms of lower prices and access to a wider variety of goods and services, in contrast, had basically no impact. This project will study how peopleâ€™s attitudes and beliefs change in response to framings that highlight potential employment losses (in import competing sectors) and to framings that highlight employment gains (in export-oriented sectors). To this end, we will conduct a large-scale survey experiment in eighteen Latin American countries. "
