abstract: "Public health authorities in high-income countries encourage excessive testing as a strategy to break the chain of COVID-19 infections and to identify high risk areas. This strategy is usually unfeasible in many Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) countries, such as Pakistan. In this study, we design and test the effectiveness of different awareness campaign strategies aiming at encouraging preventive behavior during a pandemic where ground mobilization is limited. The awareness campaign is designed and implemented in close cooperation with two implementing partners, Acted Pakistan and the National Rural Support Programme (NRSP). The target population are beneficiaries of the two NGOs across the three provinces of Pakistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Sindh. As of early November 2020, contacts of NGO beneficiaries and community representatives (incl. community leaders) were collected in 1526 (sampled in two waves: 1147+379) villages. Out of these, 1016 (764+252) villages were randomized to receive the awareness campaign. The remaining 510 (383+127) villages serve as control group (with no intervention). The awareness campaign is conducted via two modalities: via phone calls only 762 (573+189) villages or phone calls and remote mobilization of local task forces 254 (191+63) villages. Additionally, individuals in the treatment villages were randomized to receive five different awareness messages via phone calls. The survey is conducted remotely, over the phone. Outcomes at baseline were captured for beneficiaries and community representatives (incl. community leaders). We plan to follow the same individuals over five bi-monthly short surveys capturing key main outcomes. The endline survey is planned for December 2020. The main aim of the study is to test the effectiveness of the awareness campaign on knowledge, perceptions, behavior (labor supply and adherence to preventive measures) as well as health status. In addition, we capture information on intervention delivery (implementation and take-up). The awareness campaign is being launched in the last week of September 2020 and continues until the enplane data collection in December. While the baseline data for randomization is fixed, we do collect additional refresher contacts in the same villages and also plan to collect a new sample of additional villages to which the study will be extended. Thus, once baseline outcomes and characteristics are retrieved, these contacts will also become part of the eligible pool for the research study. "
