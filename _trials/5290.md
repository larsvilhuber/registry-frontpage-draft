abstract: "Low income households in agrarian developing economies continue to face considerable agricultural and livelihood risks which have serious negative impacts on household welfare. Incomplete insurance markets present an external constraint to risk management and are well studied in the literature. A growing literature has focused on internal constraints to development such as how time inconsistent preferences or aspiration failures can negatively affect saving and investment behavior. Here I propose that internal constraints may also hinder risk management. Specifically, I propose that concerns over fairness that arise in a context of wealth inequality may hinder the development of efficient informal risk management networks and influence the demand for formal insurance products. To test this theory, I utilize a framed field experiment conducted among smallholder farmers in northern Ghana to investigate the role of wealth inequality and fairness on participation in formal and informal risk sharing tools.
