abstract: "This project explores the direct and network effects of communication messages on tax compliance and paperless billing sign-up. We conduct a randomized communication campaign in a large municipality of Argentina where neighbors are required to pay a monthly fee on their real estate, locally known as Tasa por Servicios Generales (TSG), which accounts for most of the local own revenues in Argentine municipalities. The municipality where the experiment takes place has recently enabled a paperless billing option for taxpayers to receive their monthly bill by e-mail in lieu of the regular paper bill. Our campaign consists of sending letters to randomly selected dwellings where we remind neighbors about the paperless option, how to sign up, and we also include information about the status of the account, due dates, past due debt, etc. Our goal is to study the effects on monthly payments and the sign-up to digital billing, and also to analyze whether the campaign creates spillover effects on neighbors that live nearby but that do not receive a letter."
