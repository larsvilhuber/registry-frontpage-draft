abstract: "“AI-tocracy” describes a potential governance model where individual behavior is influenced and regulated by advancements in Artificial Intelligence. This study explores the nature of AI-tocracy through a series of controlled laboratory experiments. We investigate how AI-generated social scores, when coupled with punitive measures, impact individual cooperation within group settings. Furthermore, this research examines the decision-making processes of individuals when faced with the choice to adopt AI-control mechanisms. Additionally, the research aims to explore the welfare implications and potential future trajectories of AI-tocracy in various economic and social contexts."
