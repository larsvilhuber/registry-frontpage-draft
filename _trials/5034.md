abstract: "Using a large-scale IQ test, this experiment investigates whether and how performance on multiple choice questions is affected by the opportunity of mixing the answers. Prior research shows that when facing difficult choices over similarly attractive options, people tend to choose the default option or procrastinate, and mixing the answers might enhance their performance. Each participant is randomly assigned a scoring rule. Under the standard scoring rule, participants can choose only one option, and receive the maximum score for the question if the correct option is chosen and zero otherwise. Under two nonstandard scoring rules, participants can choose any number k of options, and the scores will be determined either by probability mixing or outcome mixing."
