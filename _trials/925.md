abstract: "We conduct a randomized field experiment in cooperation with Namibia Water Corporation Ltd. (NamWater) to improve payment behavior (reduce non-payments) for water consumption among private customers in rural Namibia, one of the driest countries in the world. In the first stage of the experiment we analyze a data panel about payment behavior of private customers in rural areas. In a second stage we conduct telephone interviews to investigate reasons for non-payment. Building on the insights from the second stage, we send invoice information by SMS and additionally test two behaviorally informed interventions featuring two types of commitment strategies: an implementation intentions treatment and an identity consistency treatment."
