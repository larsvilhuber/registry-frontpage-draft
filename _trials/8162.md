abstract: "Gender gaps in the labour market are widespread and they persist through old-age, with women receiving lower pensions compared to men, and being at higher risk of poverty. Though the policy debate on strengthening female empowerment has gained momentum in the last decade, policy changes have been slow, often focused on compensatory measures, and in disregard of how gender inequality develops over the life cycle. Part of policy inaction can stem from limited information about the extent of gender inequality, the long-term effect of low labour market participation and the persistence of inequality over the life course. It can also depend on different exposure to gender inequality as an individual or different historical experiences as a society. 

Through a survey experiment, our goal is to evaluate the effect of information provision regarding the gender pay gap and the gender pension gap on participants' preferences towards labor market and pension reform measures, and on the intertwining between the two. To explore the role of cultural background, we analyze whether the effect of information provision differs when participants receive information on the gaps for East and West Germany, instead of on the gaps for the whole of Germany.
