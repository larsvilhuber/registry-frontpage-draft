abstract: "Young people actively consume information coming from various sources - from parents, from teachers, from friends, from social networks, from virtual game communities, and, of course, from the media. However, the question remains unanswered: whether high school students are ready to accept the news as a fact without doubt, or on the contrary, they think about the credibility of the source. Such knowledge and understanding are important both for professional producers of news (media) and when disseminating information in an informal communication environment.
In this scientific work, a study was conducted that allowed us to understand exactly how high school students receive information and are they ready to analyze the news they consume? Obviously, they rely on the news as a means of learning. As a result, we found out that the majority of high school students are ready to listen to separate trainings to improve media literacy and self-development."
