abstract: "Many behavioural and cognitive biases have been linked with poorer financial decisions, which literature suggests as a reason for limited impact of financial education programs and smaller levels of financial literacy. Although behavioural heuristics can sometimes help and simplify decision making, it can also lead to sub-optimal and undesired outcomes. This research project develops a randomized controlled trial to test different financial education interventions to reduce the negative effect of two heuristics (availability and gambler’s fallacy) to the financial decision-making of secondary school students of Belgium. With this, it aims to verify if financial education based on heuristics can have an indirect effect to financial literacy mediated by better awareness to heuristics. Besides a baseline condition that will not receive an intervention, this work proposes three types of cumulative intervention: (i) regular financial education; (ii) additional material to increase awareness to heuristics; (iii) complementary material about the dangers of heuristics.
