abstract: "The modernization of agriculture requires transitioning from subsistence farming to market-driven, commercial agriculture in which output is sold into value chains. However, smallholder farmers typically do not sell their output to buyers in value chains, instead selling output locally or using for own consumption. We conduct a randomized controlled trial with 180 smallholder farmer cooperatives in which we connect them to processors via the World Food Programmer's Farm to Market Alliance (FtMA) program. We evaluate effects on outcomes such as sales and revenue, as well as input usage and yields. "
