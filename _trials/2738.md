abstract: "The study aims at evaluating the impact of an extensive counseling program, which is provided to high school students in academically oriented high schools (Gymnasium) and comprehensive high schools (Gesamtschulen) in Germany. During the intervention, specifically trained guidance counselors serve as contact persons for all questions regarding post-school pathways and provide information on post-secondary educational programs. The intervention especially targets low-SES students aiming at reducing social inequality in the transition to higher education. The study will investigate whether the intervention reduces educational inequality by means of analyzing the intervention's effect on higher education enrollment rates. Additionally, the impact on students' overall subjective satisfaction with their educational choices and on non-cognitive skills will be examined. Thus, the study will contribute to the literature on the impact of counseling programs on the reduction of educational inequality."
