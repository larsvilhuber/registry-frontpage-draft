abstract: "There is a long-standing interest in the impact of bystander intervention programs on bystander helping behavior in violent situations. Furthermore, the question has arisen of how such programs might be enhanced using persuasive technology based on the gamification approach. We provide experimental evidence for the effect of an interactive online bystander intervention on (1) the willingness to intervene in situations with a high risk of violence to occur and (2) the actual donation to victim support, which serves as a proxy variable of actual bystander helping behavior."
