abstract: "This study aims to find causal evidence on the relationship between safety in the public transport and commuters' transport mode choice. This study has three main research questions to be answered. First, we want to get an estimate of what is the willingness to pay for safety in the public transport. Second, for a given trip, up to what extent would people substitute their choice of transport mode from private taxis (say, Uber or Lyft) to bus if safety in the latter increases. Finally, we want to understand whether higher insecurity in the public transport system crowds out support for other policies (in particular, environmental policies). We study this through a non-incetivized lab experiment carried on in eight Latin American countries. The study is divided in three different experiments, where participants are randomized in different groups where each group is presented with a different set of information. While in the first two experiments participants are asked to choose between different transport modes, in the last one we ask the participants to allocate a budget between four policies as if they were policymakers. We hope that the results of this study would contribute to understand whether increasing the safety in the public transport system plays a role in tackling climate change by substituting from private to public transport modes."
