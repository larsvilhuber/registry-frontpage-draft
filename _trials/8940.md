abstract: "We use a randomized control trial on a sample of German brokerage clients to study the effect of inflation beliefs on investment choices. We first elicit inflation-related beliefs, including estimates of asset returns in past inflationary periods. To shift beliefs about inflation and how to protect against it, three treatment groups then receive two sets of information: a first treatment arm receives information on the recent inflation surge in Germany, a second arm on asset returns during historical periods of high and increasing inflation, and a third one a combination of both. One control group receives no information. Following the information provision, we test for treatment effects on inflation beliefs, asset-return expectations, and hypothetical portfolio choices. Importantly, we also use bank data to test whether the treatments feed into actual portfolio and consumption choices. The latter serves to compare our treatment effects to the existing literature linking inflation beliefs to consumption decisions. Moreover, elicitation of a wide array of additional post-treatment beliefs on the householdâ€™s expected financial situation, overall economy, and corporate outcomes allows us to pinpoint underlying mechanisms. 

We also plan to investigate the role of (prior) investor beliefs about how to protect against a surge in inflation, as elicited in the survey, using observational data. We test whether we find trading consistent with these inflation-hedging beliefs shortly after announcements of inflation increases in Germany in 2021. We use portfolio-transaction data on the brokerage clients that participate in the survey as well as on a broader set of brokerage clients. For survey participants, we can use their respective inflation-hedging beliefs; for the broader set of brokerage clients, we test for portfolio choices consistent with average inflation-hedging beliefs.
