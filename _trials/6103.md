abstract: "We present a representative sample of the U.S. population the story of one of two Mexican immigrants, a 20-something college student and a 40-something retail worker. After describing the person we randomly state one of three possible scenarios (a) nothing, (b) that the person is a legal U.S. resident from Mexico, and (c) that the person is an undocumented immigrant from Mexico.  After presenting these scenarios, we ask survey takers about different social choices they would make, such as inviting them to their house, introducing them to their friends, and others.  We estimate changes in the likelihood of doing these social actions across conditions as the 'social costs of being undocumented'."
