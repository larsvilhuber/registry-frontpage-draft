abstract: "We conduct laboratory experiments to compare decentralized bargaining to automated dispute resolution in scenarios of either one-issue or two-issue bargaining. For one-issue situations, the optimal mechanism neither achieves full efficiency nor is strategy-proof. However, for disputes involving two issues, an efficient and strategy-proof mechanism can be achieved within a confined parameter set. Within subjects, we vary whether these parameters allow for strategy-proofness in two-issue scenarios. Between subjects, we vary the ODR mechanisms, differentiating between direct and sequential formats. Free-form bargaining serves as our reference baseline."
