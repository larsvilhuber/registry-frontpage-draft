abstract: "Moral licensing means that, people who have shown pro-social behavior in a first stage, feel morally entitled to behave less pro-socially in a second stage. The literature on moral licensing has mainly focused on two similar decisions such as taking money for donation. We extend the literature by considering an online experiment where subjects work on a real-effort task in stage 2. In stage 1, our subjects in the treatment group decide on taking money designated for donation. In the control group, this decision is instead made by a random computer draw. In the second stage, subjects work on the real-effort task once for their own account and once for the charityâ€™s account (with random order to account for learning and behavioral effects). Our main research question is whether those who take the money for donation invest, relative to working for their own account, more or less effort compared to those who did not take the money. Our control treatment allows us, in addition, to see whether the effect of getting the money is driven by the active decision to take the money, or whether it exists also when the money is transferred by a random computer draw.
