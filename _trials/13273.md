abstract: "This research delves into the role of reward systems in enhancing cooperation amidst the challenges posed by imperfectly transparent individual contributions. Tackling the persistent social dilemma where private and public interests often collide, our study provides novel insights into the dynamics of sustaining collective effort when contributions are not fully observable. We investigate the influence of reward mechanisms on cooperative behavior through an experimental gameâ€”the Voluntary Contribution Mechanism with Rewards (VCMR). Our design contrasts centralized reward (CR) systems, where an authority distributes rewards, with decentralized reward (DR) systems, where peers allocate rewards, and a no-reward (NR) baseline. Our findings reveal that reward systems, particularly CR, not only foster greater cooperation than the NR baseline but also exhibit resilience in the face of significant information ambiguity. Participants prefer CR over DR and NR, highlighting a preference for institutionalized incentives in uncertain environments. The findings contribute to the literature by showcasing the efficacy of centralized rewards in overcoming the detriments of information imperfection. The study offers breaks new ground and offers critical guidance for policymakers and organizational leaders in crafting incentive mechanisms that are both effective and robust, ensuring sustained collective action even when individual efforts are not perfectly observable."
