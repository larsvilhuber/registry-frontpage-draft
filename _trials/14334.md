abstract: "Effect of Virtual Reality on Anxiety, Stress, Pain and Patient`s Satisfaction among Palestinian Patients Undergoing Colonoscopy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

The current study aims to study the effect of virtual reality on anxiety, stress, pain, and patient satisfaction during colonoscopy procedure. The results of this study may contribute to evaluating the effectiveness of virtual reality technology in reducing and treating the level of anxiety, stress and pain among patients instead of traditional methods and common pharmaceutical methods and raising the level of patient satisfaction during this procedure. Moreover, it adds to evidence-based practice by using VR as a method for treating mental health disorders, including stress and anxiety.

The researcher starts collecting data from patients before starting procedure, patients will complete socio-demographic data, STAI, and PSS-10, which take approximately 25–30 minutes. The patient will receive an immersive VR intervention that includes meditative 3D videos for the natural environment by head-mounted device, and earphones to listen to soothing nature sounds for 30 minutes. Post procedure, the researcher redistributed questionnaires among patients in both groups, which included STAI and PSS-10, and VAS to evaluate patients' satisfaction levels and pain level which take approximately 25–30 minutes.
