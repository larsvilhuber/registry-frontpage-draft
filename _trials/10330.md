abstract: "Despite federal law banning the use of new lead service lines in drinking water systems for decades due to their detrimental health effects, an estimated 9.7 to 12.8 million legacy lead service lines (LSLs) connect water mains to homes in the United States (NRDC 2021). Many public water systems are struggling to locate and replace lead pipes with safe alternatives, particularly due to the scale of the problem and persistent challenges of gaining cooperation from some segments of the population. 

The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of interventions designed to overcome the barriers public water systems face when trying to locate lead service lines in these “hard-to-reach” populations. In partnership with Trenton Water Works, a major public utility in Trenton, New Jersey, we will test several different interventions encouraging members of these “hard-to-reach” populations to submit a simple “self-inspection” of their pipes (consisting primarily of photos of the pipes) to the utility to help them locate lead on the private, homeowner side of the service line.
