abstract: "To control the spread of coronavirus, the Kenyan Ministry of Health COVID-19 Taskforce has implemented initial prevention and mitigation measures. Of concern are the densely overcrowded, poor urban slums where sanitation and social distancing measures are near impossible. COVID-19 would spread rapidly and be devastating under these conditions. To inform the Taskforce strategy, this study will deploy rapid phone-based surveys on knowledge, attitudes and practices to heads of household sampled from existing randomized evaluation cohorts across five Nairobi urban slums (n~7,500). Iterations of the survey will be conducted every month. Three surveys have been completed to date beginning in March 2020, to better understand awareness of COVID-19 symptoms, perceived risk, awareness of and ability to carry out preventive behaviors, misconceptions, and the social and economic effects of COVID-19 mitigation measures. The Ministry of Health in Kenya has been sending SMS to all Kenyans. A key concern is stigma toward COVID-19 cases or suspected cases, and that household members would not care for asymptomatic COVID-19 infected household members. Before sending messages out on this topic, we will be testing three different versions of the SMS to determine which is the most effective. Participants in our cohort (n=1,910) will be randomly assigned to receive one of three versions of an SMS message meant to reduce stigma. The messages will be simple (control), prosocial or self-benefit motivated. The messages will be sent at two time points 6 days apart and then a survey will be conducted to assess knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intention. This study aims to measure the effectiveness of these messages in increasing knowledge and reducing stigma, and to determine which motivational approach is more effective.  Findings will be shared with the Ministry of Health and used to refine government run SMS campaigns to increase knowledge and adoption of the promoted behaviors."
