abstract: "A crucial component in the bank-client relationship is trust. Clients do not deposit their savings with a bank that they do not trust. Many countries are currently in the process of pushing their populations to adopt formal bank accounts instead, or in addition to, more traditional forms of savings. A successful move from the informal financial sector to formal banks undoubtedly requires a high level of trust between the people and the banks. In this study, we investigate whether trust can be fostered by increasing financial interactions between clients and bankers.

We use two interventions in 17 villages of Chhattisgarh where formal banking through the Business Correspondent model was recently introduced.  First, we sample two groups of people: (A) villagers who deliberately opened a bank account, and (B) villagers who did not. The group B villagers are offered an account. Next, half the villagers of both group A and group B are randomly assigned to the second intervention: they receive weekly payments on their bank accounts. The other half (= control) receive the same amounts in cash. 

After 2-3 months of weekly payments, we measure trust levels and altruism towards bankers, as well as risk attitudes, using trust, dictator and risk games in a lab-in-the-field setting. This allows us to answer our research question, namely whether trust can be fostered by promoting the usage of accounts and the interactions between clients and their banker."
