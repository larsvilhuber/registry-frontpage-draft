abstract: "This study is a follow-up to AEARCTR-0003300 ("Can children’s engagement in recycling processes reduce household waste?"). Again, we perform an educational intervention with school children aged 10-16 in two municipalities in Sweden, treating some 200 children (expected), and couple with municipal waste data to check whether the intervention impacts waste behavior in households with participating children. The new study differs from the previous one in the following ways. First, to strengthen the intervention and effectively provide additional reminders of the desirability of pro-environmental behavior, we add two additional classroom sessions to the design. Second, for similar reasons, we prolong the home assignment from seven to ten days. Third, to better integrate our intervention into existing curricula, it is now conducted by regular teaching staff rather than directly by us. Fourth, to maintain sample size, we do not randomize students into treatment and control: all participating students are treated. Identification instead uses matching and/or weighting on pre-intervention baseline data to construct a suitable control group for households with a participating student."
