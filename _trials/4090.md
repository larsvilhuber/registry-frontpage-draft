abstract: "This study investigates the determinants of support for dynamic climate policy. We examine the role of personal characteristics such as time and risk preferences and of policy characteristics such as the distribution of costs and international cooperation. This is done through a series of survey experiments embedded in surveys of a representative sample of the population in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. "
