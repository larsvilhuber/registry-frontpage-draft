abstract: "Introduction. The South African National Department of Health sought to improve syndromic management of sexually transmitted infections (STI). An STI training was delivered at primary health care (PHC) clinics, and a cluster randomized trial compared controls to participants with three different delivery methods: 1) lecture, 2) computer, 3) paper-based.

Methods. Ten PHC clinics were randomly assigned to control and 10 to each delivery method arm. Clinicians participated in on-site training on two modules per week for three weeks. Each clinic was visited by three or four unannounced Standardized Patient (SPs) actors pre and post training. Male SPs reported symptoms of male urethritis syndrome and females SPs reported symptoms of vaginal discharge syndrome. Quality of care was measured by whether or not clinicians completed five tasks: HIV test, genital exam, correct medications, condoms, and partner notification.

Results. An average of 31% of clinicians from each PHC attended the beginning of each module. Pre-training (n=128) clinicians completed an average of 1.63 tasks. Post-training (n=114) they completed 1.73. There was no change in the number of STI tasks completed in the control arm and an 11% increase overall in the training arms relative to the control (ratio of relative risk (RRR)=1.11, 95%CI=0.67,1.84). Across delivery arms, there was a 26% increase (RRR=1.26, 95%CI=0.77, 2.06) associated with lecture, 17% increase (RRR=1.17, 95%CI=0.59,2.28) with paper-based, and 13% decrease (RRR=0.87, 95%CI=0.40,1.90) with computer arm relative to the control.

Conclusion. STI management improved for lecture and paper-based delivery methods despite low training attendance. Increases were not statistically significant.
