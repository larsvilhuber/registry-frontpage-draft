abstract: "This experiment will test whether the experience of resisting temptation to quit an activity or task boosts subjects’ determination to complete that task.  

We pursue this question through a collaboration with a gym to randomly offer some new members the chance to give up their membership and have their membership fee refunded.  Our hypothesis is that those who are presented with and resist the temptation will come to the gym more often and renew their membership at higher rates.  In particular, we want to test whether the group of people who are offered a temptation to quit the gym ends up exercising more – even after including (in our intent to treat analysis) those students who accept the temptation and quit their gym membership.

By rejecting a temptation a person is able to learn something about herself, which in turn will increase her commitment to a certain activity or task.   Bénabou and Tirole (2004) map a theoretical framework for “willpower activities” like resisting temptation.  They hypothesize that resisting temptation is “hard” information that even people with imperfect recall about their state of mind—for example, being committed to going to the gym—can use to build an enduring image of themselves.   Resisting the temptation provides the actor information about his ability to commit to a course of action and hence about the likelihood of success. This new information will, in turn, make it easier and more attractive to stay on the task rather than quitting.  Our experiment will test this theory.
