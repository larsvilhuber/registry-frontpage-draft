abstract: "Entrepreneurs are often depicted as boundedly rational and myopic decision-makers who rely on local search and readily available data (Moore, Oesch, and Zietsma, 2007; Simon, 1957). When searching and attempting to define or assess market opportunities, entrepreneurs are guided by their pre-existing experiences. Their knowledge sets coming from individual experiences, backgrounds, values, and beliefs, or domains, define what is salient when framing strategic and entrepreneurial problems (Camuffo, Gambardella, and Pignataro, 2023).

While there is a growing body of literature arguing that theory framing is essential in strategic and entrepreneurial decision making (Felin and Zenger, 2017), little is known about the relationship between entrepreneurial domains, theory framing, and entrepreneurial idea (and solution) generation.

Since exploration beyond what is known can expand the opportunity set at the expense of increased uncertainty and monetary and non-monetary (i.e., time, effort) costs, it is unclear whether exploration beyond initial domains can be beneficial or not. Given this trade-off, we argue that entrepreneurs who engage in “scientific entrepreneurship” (Zellweger and Zenger, 2023), adopting a theory-based experimentation approach, explore in a more structured way and are able to reduce the burden of expanded search (Camuffo, Cordova, Gambardella, and Spina, 2020).

The goal of this project is to understand whether making entrepreneurs aware of the impact exerted by their domains on their entrepreneurial ideas, and endowing them with a structured decision-making approach, triggers a change in experimentation, search, and idea formulation. To this aim, we investigate the impact that domain awareness (which shall trigger increased exploration) has in conjunction to scientific or theory-based experimentation (which shall reduce the cost of exploration).

A companion study finds that domain awareness and theory-based experimentation have a complementary effect on the number of high-quality ideas generated by entrepreneurs (Frosi, Chondrakis, Gagliardi, and Mariani, 2024), but it remains agnostic as to what mechanism underlies this increase in idea generation.

This study adopts a similar design, and it aims to uncover the mechanisms underlying the main effects of receiving the domains intervention and the scientific (or theory-based) intervention (i.e., more and better ideas), attempting to understand what drives the increased number of ideas found in the field experiment with entrepreneurs. Lastly, this study aims to replicate the main effects of the same study (Frosi, Chondrakis, Gagliardi, and Mariani, 2024).

This project designs and implements a laboratory experiment following up on a field experiment with early-stage entrepreneurs carried out at ESADE University in Spain (previously pre-registered on AEA under the code AEARCTR-0009325) and a pilot laboratory experiment with entrepreneurship graduate students at Bocconi University in Italy (previously pre-registered on AEA under the code AEARCTR-0013189).

Practically, in this laboratory experiment, we leverage on a sample of 115 prospective MSc students (enrolled in different MSc programs at ESADE Business School). Participants will be randomly allocated to 4 experimental conditions (domains intervention: treated and control X theory intervention: treated and control). Participants will be randomly allocated to groups for the "theory" intervention (focused on the application of the Scientific Approach to entrepreneurial decision making) and for the "domains" intervention (focused on highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of exploring beyond initial domains), following a 2x2 experimental design. We will adopt a simple randomization technique.

The theory intervention is a representative but shorter version of the intervention delivered in the field experiment (AEARCTR-0009325) and it provides participants with a decision-making methodology that focuses on thoroughly framing a problem and on theorizing prior to experimenting. The domains intervention, similarly, is a representative but shorter version of the domains intervention delivered in the same field experiment (AEARCTR-0009325). In terms of execution, for the domains intervention we leverage on a simulation platform, following the same protocol of a pilot laboratory experiment run with students at Bocconi University (AEARCTR-0013189). Through this intervention, we make participants aware of their domains (the set of knowledge they derive from their past experiences and background) and of the impact that domains exert on the framing of their entrepreneurial theories.

Trainers will deliver the theory intervention via a frontal lesson, while the domains intervention will be based on a business simulation. During the latter, participants will be provided with a problem identified by an early-stage start-up, and will be asked to frame a “theory of value” (Agarwal et al., 2023) that maps the identified problem to an entrepreneurial solution. Following the first theory framing attempt, all participants will be shown a video, which will vary depending on their allocation:

1) Domains-Treated participants will receive an 8.10-minutes training video emphasizing the existence of domain-defining factors, their impact on theory formulation, and the advantages and disadvantages derived from exploring beyond them. Moreover, they will be asked to reflect on their own individual domains and how these may be influencing the theory framing that they are coming up with for the business simulation; the “treatment video” will also talk about scaling a business, and focusing on how start-ups move from theory formulation to execution.

2) Domains-Control participants will receive an 8.10-minutes training (placebo) video talking about scaling a business, and focusing on how start-ups move from theory formulation to execution.

After the video, we will collect a number of self-reported and objective measures of performance, and we will compare them across different experimental cells to investigate the interaction between the domains and the theory-based interventions on exploration, theory formulation, and entrepreneurial solution generation."
