abstract: "Poor mental health among displaced populations is a widespread problem. Even where psychiatric help is available, uptake is limited by fear of stigma, and shame as well as by informational and language barriers. This randomized controlled experiment evaluates a within-survey experiment with anti-stigma messaging and information in two videos, one featuring well-known celebrities and one featuring a relatable refugee speaking from personal experience. The intervention focuses on Ukrainian refugees in Germany, a large group of displaced individuals with extensive access to digital services, and in a context where both cost and language barriers to access mental health support services are low. The study aims to test whether videos addressing possible information gaps and stigma impact attitudes vis-à-vis mental health, increase help-seeking and the uptake of mental health support among these populations, and whether this has an impact on labor market participation and health. More specifically, the evaluated intervention puts two elements together. First, a hotline run by Ukrainian-speaking psychotherapists provides an accessible gate of entry to available mental health care. Second, videos displayed within the already existing online panel survey “Ukrainian Refugees in Germany (BiB/FReDA-Study)" encourage help-seeking behavior and refer to the hotline. Our research is primarily designed to measure which video leads to more engagement with the hotline and to changes in attitudes on mental health and perceived barriers to help-seeking.
