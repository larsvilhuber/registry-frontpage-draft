abstract: "I study organizational dynamics in bureaucracies associated with the decentralized collection of administrative data. By decentralized data collection, I refer to state data that is solicited from decentralized governments by a central government agency. In collaboration with a national government organization in Colombia, I study organizational dynamics associated with the collection, reporting, and use of data within both decentralized governments and the partner agency itself. I study reporting behavior by bureaucrats in decentralized governments experimentally by embedding an RCT in a nation-wide administrative data collection effort. I the use of data by bureaucrats in the central government (partner) agency using qualitative methods.  "
