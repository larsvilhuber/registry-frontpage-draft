abstract: "Weather is a key source of income risk for many firms and households,
particularly in emerging market economies. This paper studies how an
innovative risk management instrument for hedging rainfall risk affects
production decisions among a sample of Indian agricultural firms,
using a randomized controlled trial approach. We find that the
provision of insurance induces farmers to shift production towards
higher-return but higher-risk cash crops, particularly amongst more educated
farmers. Our results support the view that financial innovation
may help mitigate the real effects of uninsured production risk. 

In a second experiment we elicit willingness to pay for insurance policies
that differ in their contract terms, using the Becker-DeGroot-Marshak
mechanism. Willingness-to-pay is increasing in the actuarial value of
the insurance, but substantially less than one-for-one, suggesting a disconnect between what farmers may need and want. "
