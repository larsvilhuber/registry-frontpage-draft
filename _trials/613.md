abstract: "This research addresses the problem of overconfidence about the future ability to attain goals with persuasive messages. It is carried out in the context of attaining savings goals. We argue that savers underestimate their future ability to save and hence save too little, or stop saving altogether, in the future because savings goals at present are chosen with overconfidence. We argue that persuasive messages given at the time when a goal is made can help overconfident individuals who overestimate their own ability to reach the goals, i.e. we hypothesize that persuading savers to make more realistic savings goals at the time they formulate them will help them reach their savings goals with a higher likelihood. However, depending on the behavioral bias there may also be savers who are underconfident, i.e. individuals who underestimate their savings potential. These savers might be helped with a persuasive message encouraging them to be more ambitious with their savings goals. For the trial, we assign moneyboxes in combination with persuasive messages to current and former clients of a microfinance institution. The persuasive messages are delivered at the time clients formulate their savings goals."
