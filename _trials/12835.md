abstract: "This study will try to understand the possible heterogeneous consumption response of "hand-to-mouth" and non-"hand-to-mouth"  agents to publicly available information on actual inflation and inflation expectations. Using a repeated cross-sectional U.S. representative survey, we plan to get information on respondents that allows us to study their "hand-to-mouth" condition. Moreover, we plan to implement different information treatments to randomly selected subsets of each category of respondents and affect their inflation expectations about different varieties of goods corresponding to services, non-durable, semi-durable, and durable products. The differential effects of these information treatments will allow us to identify exogenous variations in the perceived inflation level of households. With hypothetical follow-up questions, we will obtain information regarding the spending plan for the different consumption categories and characterize the extent to which different expectations imply differences in the spending decision on the various goods categories."
