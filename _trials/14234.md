abstract: "We will conduct a survey experiment to test whether male and female experts have a different influence on the opinions of members of the public. Specifically, we will compare the influence of male and female experts on the opinions formed by members of the public on a set of topical economic policy issues. Our previous study (AEARCTR-0011764) found, contrary to expectation and previous evidence of discrimination against female expertise, that female experts were more persuasive. One hypothesis is that their credentials (title and institutional affiliation) may have been signals of expertise. This study will replicate the previous analysis but remove these signals in order to test this hypothesis."
