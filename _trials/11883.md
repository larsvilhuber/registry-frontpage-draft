abstract: "Affordable housing is a critical challenge across many developing countries, including Nigeria, where the housing deficit is estimated to be between 17 million â€“ 21 million units. With rapid urbanization and population growth, innovative approaches beyond public sector housing are urgently needed to expand access to adequate and affordable housing. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) have emerged as a promising strategy by leveraging the private sector's expertise and financing capacity while harnessing the government's social objectives and convening power. However, stakeholder engagement remains a crucial barrier to implementing successful affordable housing PPPs, as private partners may lack expertise in this model and perceive risks due to unclear regulations.

This randomized field experiment evaluates the impact of tailored training interventions on private construction firms' willingness to participate in affordable housing PPPs in Nigeria. A sample of 360 senior personnel from firms will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: a control group receiving general training on housing trends, a treatment group receiving basic PPP training, and a treatment group receiving comprehensive PPP training, including detailed PPP training for affordable housing and a complete introduction to different PPP project models. Surveys will evaluate willingness to participate and the preferred PPP model before and after the training workshops. Administrative data will also track project enrolment over six months.

The experimental results will provide actionable insights for designing training programs and policy tools to catalyze win-win PPP models that align public and private goals for expanding access to adequate and affordable housing.
