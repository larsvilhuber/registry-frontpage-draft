abstract: "We have an ongoing evaluation that tests the impacts of a training program that uses online learning for 15-17 years old high school students, with a focus on teaching entrepreneurial skills and a scientific mindset. That program was taught using computers in schools, during school time, until schools were closed with the COVID-19 pandemic, after which students continued to finish the material from their homes. With the COVID-19 pandemic closing schools, school systems have been looking for content and ways to engage students. We therefore are testing the impact of launching this material to another region of the country. We are interested in two key questions:
1)  How can we best encourage take-up and usage of online learning materials among high school students during the COVID-19 school closures? This will be tested by comparing the impact of different nudges, reminders, and other interventions to encourage take-up and usage..
2) What is the impact of this program on learning outcomes? This will involve comparing impacts for students who are assigned to the personal initiative and negotiations classes to those who receive other courses. We will then also compare the learning gains from this virtual learning to those from students in our first experiment, who did most of the learning under teacher supervision in schools.
