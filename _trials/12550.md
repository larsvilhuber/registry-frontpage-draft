abstract: "Understanding how firms and markets shape local supply curves in general equilibrium, to which degree economies can absorb (and change in response to) large local demand shocks, and how consumers shopping patterns and competitive pressures respond is crucial for understanding long-term development and the effects of macroeconomic policies. We estimate the high-frequency causal impacts of universal USD 550 cash transfers to every adult in the Khongoni District in Malawi on expenditure, prices and market activity. The rollout of the 45 million in cash transfers by the NGO GiveDirectly is randomized across 34 Group Village Headman (GVHs), an administrative unit corresponding approximately to a market catchment area, will reach over 80,000 individuals over the course of 12 months, and correspond to 90% of baseline GDP. Using random variation in treatment timing, together with bi-weekly price data for over 100 products and monthly enterprise surveys in all markets within the study area and a matched sample of markets outside the study area, as well as monthly expenditure surveys with 2500 eligible households, we document high-frequency marginal propensities to consume by product (Engel curves), inflationary impacts, expenditure switching of households across markets, and changes in resulting market activity and the productive environment. This will allow us to trace out short- and medium run supply curves at the firm- and market level."
