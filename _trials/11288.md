abstract: "The experiment follows Adhvaryu et al. (2023) which demonstrates a critical role of certain managerial dimensions in determining ﬁrm productivity, and shows that intervening to improve management practices can generate meaningful impacts. We ﬁnd that several key dimensions of managerial quality, such as attention, autonomy and locus of control are important for productivity but are not appropriately priced into market pay. Firms could substantially improve productivity at a low cost via psychometric measurement and screening of potential hires, and by providing training to improve managerial deﬁciencies. Adhvaryu et al. (2023a) follows up on this insight by evaluating a managerial training   program based on the learnings from Adhvaryu et al. (2023b) identifying which managerial skills and practices contribute most to the productivity of production lines of India’s largest garment producer, Shahi Exports. The resulting program, called Supervisors Transform Into Change Holders (STITCH), was evaluated via a randomized controlled trial across hundreds of supervisors at Shahi Exports (our partner organization). The training achieved large and persistent impacts: on average eﬃciency (produced quantity/target quantity) of lines managed by trained line supervisors increased by 7.3% during training and 5.8% over the six months after the training. The proposed study empirically tests a screening and training technology that we have developed to hire and/or promote (garment) production line supervisors based on their psychometric traits and/or managerial practices to improve ﬁrm productivity and worker wellbeing. The trial will take place in 62 garment manufacturing units in India among upper- level managers and production line supervisors overseeing more than 70,000 workers of Shahi Exports. We will randomly select roughly a quarter of the units to get the screening technology, a quarter to get the training technology, and a quarter to get both while the remaining units will serve as the control group."
