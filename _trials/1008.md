abstract: "This document outlines the analysis plan for the study of the effects of three psychological interventions on cognitive control and real effort as measured by Raven's progressive matrices, a Stroop task, and a clicker task. This evaluation took place as a pilot trial across 54 villages in Migori County, Kenya. Random assignment of these psychological interventions allows us to estimate the causal impacts on cognitive control and real effort. Results of this analysis will be used to inform the selection of outcome variables for later trials. Details and an analysis plan for the full study can be found here: https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/991"
