abstract: "The realm of goal setting has been a focal point of academic research for decades, with numerous studies emphasising its profound impact on motivation and performance. However, a subtle understanding of how males and females respond differently to goal setting and its associated consequences warrants deeper exploration. This experimental research investigates the gendered nuances of goal setting, emphasising the potential differential responses to altered goal outcomes, especially in light of the broader literature on the meaning of work. Existing literature suggests that individuals seek a meaning attached to their jobs. They tend to prefer working on projects that extend beyond mere financial compensation. This preference is often more pronounced among females who tend to gravitate towards work featuring social interaction and helping others. While males may also appreciate the social impact of work, they are mainly motivated by achievement-oriented factors such as competition and promotion. This distinction may underscore the inherent differences in how each gender perceives and responds to goals. 
In this research, we aim to enrich the concept of goal setting by infusing it with a layer of meaning. Specifically, our study introduces the concept of “meaningful goals” by linking individual performance goals with charitable contributions. Participants will set performance goals that have consequences not only for themselves but also for a charitable cause. We hypothesise that this meaningful goal setting intervention will increase performance compared to a standard goal setting intervention or a no-goal condition. Moreover, given their strong inclination toward social impact and helping others in their work preferences, we hypothesise that females may derive even more significant benefits from the meaningful goal setting intervention than their male counterparts. This research contributes to understanding how gender differences intersect with goal setting and the value individuals place on goal consequences. By exploring the impact of meaningful goal setting, we aim to shed light on innovative ways to enhance motivation and performance, ultimately  empowering individuals to achieve their goals more effectively.
