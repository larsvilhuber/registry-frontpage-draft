abstract: "In the experiment, we study how competition for social status affects individualâ€™s effort level and linking decisions within a social network. We assume homogeneous agents with general linear-quadratic payoff functions where their effort levels exhibit strategic complementarity and positive externality. With costly effort and linking decisions, we introduce two settings on status competition, i.e., monetary status benefits and information on relative position within the group in terms of payoffs, to see whether status competition can increase collaborative effort provision, therefore enhance efficiency.
