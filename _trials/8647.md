abstract: "Many scholars highlighted the importance of honesty for development (Mokyr 2007, Wolla 2013, and Cohn et al. 2019). Yet, little research is done to promote it, particularly in the developing world (Debono et al. 2017 and Mazar et al. 2008). I propose a randomized control trial to measure the impact of different types of reminders in promoting honesty in Sudan – a developing country in Sub-Saharan Africa. Particularly, how do intrinsic reminders about different values compare to extrinsic reminders about the potential punishment of an authority figure or an institution in increasing honesty? Furthermore, I will frame these reminders using religious and non-religious messages to observe the relative response to these frames in a culture where religious beliefs play an important role in people’s lives."
