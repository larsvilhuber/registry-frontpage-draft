abstract: "Understanding how citizens form their preferences for redistribution is crucial for policy makers in order to implement appropriate measures to counteract inequality. As inequality in the United States has been growing in the past decades and in particular in the light of the current COVID-19 crisis, this is a highly relevant question. We investigate two determinants of preferences for redistribution: relative income and perception of social mobility. We do this by using an online survey experiment within a representative sample of US citizens. We experimentally change i) the participantâ€™s relative income, i.e. her position in the income distribution, and ii) her perception about the degree of social mobility. Our novel methodology allows us to not only identify the willingness of a taxpayer to redistribute own income between herself and others (selfish motive), but also her preferences over how income is allocated among all persons in the income distribution (fairness motive)."
