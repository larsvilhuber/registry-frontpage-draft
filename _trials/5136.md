abstract: "While it is widely recognized that 401(k) enrollees are more willing to commit to increases in future, relative to present, savings, clarifying how enrollees conceptualize the “future” is an open question. Clarifying how individuals conceptualize the future, in the specific domain of savings, could help policy-makers and program designers encourage savings via optimized design of auto-enrollment interfaces and could help deepen our understanding of the mechanisms that drive individuals to exhibit present-focus in their intertemporal financial decisions. The proposed project would investigate these questions by testing how the willingness of US employees to enroll in 401(k) automatic escalation varies across the default escalation delay, default escalation increment, and the framing of the auto-escalation delay through a randomized field study administered across several hundred 401(k) plans sponsored by Voya Financial. The field study will be supplemented with experimental studies to investigate mechanisms. "
