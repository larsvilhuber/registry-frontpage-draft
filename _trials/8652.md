abstract: "Evaluating Learning Interactions (ELI) is an RCT intended to help low-income parents improve the literacy skills and curiosity of their 3-5 year-old children. One of two treatments encourages parents to engage in traditional academic interactions with their child and the second encourages curiosity-based interactions. In academic interactions parents engage their children in activities intended to convey specific information such as new vocabulary words and letter sounds or recognition. In curiosity-based interactions parents engage in open-ended conversation to promote curiosity. The outcomes of this RCT are measures of children’s literacy skills and curiosity. Our hypothesis is that motivating curiosity-based parent-child interactions will increase children’s literacy skills, curiosity, and enthusiasm for learning more than motivating academic interactions but both treatments will increase literacy skills more than the control group. ELI is a six-month text-based program for low-income families. "
