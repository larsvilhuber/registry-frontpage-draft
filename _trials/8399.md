abstract: "The shift to online teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged Universities to maintain high students' motivation and performance. This study will investigate the effectiveness of text messages (SMS) as a nudging tool to increase learning engagement and improve academic performance. Specifically, we will test if SMS can improve academic performance (as measured by final exam grades) regardless of the information they convey. Our hypothesis is that receiving SMS motivates the students to study regularly throughout the semester.  
We will run a non-placebo randomized controlled trial (RCT) at the University of Hohenheim (Germany) within a large postgraduate course in "Multivariate Data Analysis" (MVDA; winter term 2021/2022). The students (who will provide their consent to take part in this study) will be randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. The former will receive a total of 34 short SMS throughout the semester, whereas the latter group will have access to the same information via the ILIAS online learning platform. By providing the control group the information on a platform (and not via text messages) allows us to directly measure the motivational effect of such messages (as oppose to content). Before the start of the experiment, the students will participate in a survey that collects basic socio-demographic variables. At the end of the experiment, but before the first exam period, we will ask the students to complete an end-line survey about their course satisfaction and study experience during the semester.
