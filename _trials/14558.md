abstract: "This study tests the effects of information about the health risks related to sugar consumption on people's preferences toward policies that limit the consumption of high-sugar-content products. We apply an online survey experiment to a sample of 2,000 Mexican adults. We randomly assign participants to three groups: a control group, a treatment group with low-intensity information, and a treatment group with high-intensity information. Moreover, we test if the effect of information interacts with household budget constraints."
