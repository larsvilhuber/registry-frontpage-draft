abstract: "The law and economics literature has long posited that apprehending and imposing sanctions on individuals who commit offenses generates both general deterrence, aimed at the general population, and individual deterrence, aimed at the specific offender. While these general effects have been observed in various contexts, the empirical legal literature has failed to identify the mechanisms through which this learning process occurs. This paper will attempt to start filling this gap by examining, experimentally, whether potential repeat offenders (e.g., speeding, tax evasion, DUI) learn about the probability of detection from being caught at a different level of accuracy compared to learning from not being caught."
