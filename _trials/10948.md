abstract: "We are conducting a field-experiment to investigate the consequences of choosing to become self-employed on future employment prospects for non-European refugees in the Swedish labor market. We have designed a correspondence test that allows us to estimate a causal effect of self-employment experience, relative to continued wage employment and unemployment, on the likelihood of a positive
call-back from employers. Refugee immigration in Sweden has led to an increase in the workforce competing for jobs with low qualification requirements, all while unemployment for this group remains high. Without the human capital that is necessary to compete for job openings on the labor market in Sweden there might be few job opportunities, and one way to try bridging this deficiency has been to become self-employed. This study provides knowledge on whether investing in the host country’s human capital through self-employment, helps to overcome barriers for entering the labor market and increases the likelihood of employment for low-skilled refugee immigrants."
