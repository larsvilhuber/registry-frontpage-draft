abstract: "We look at the behavior of laboratory auction markets when a dynamic reserve price is imposed. When firms exit markets due to high costs, competition wavers and bidders bid less aggressively. Ensuing higher prices could conceivably be modulated by a reserve price mechanism that uses the lowest bid from the previous period. Using a controlled setting, we show how dynamics in reserve price setting influence bid shading and if the behavior of these markets are more consistent with standard predictions or with the focal point hypothesis."
