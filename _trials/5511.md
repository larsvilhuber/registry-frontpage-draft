abstract: "Reporting and Systems & Adviser Programme Services (Reporting) are in charge of collecting and combining all of the company's projects updates on bi-weekly basis and creating a report which is then shared with the higher management to help facilitate more informed decisions. A total of 53 projects need to put their inputs in the system. The system is updated either by the project managers or project coordinators all of whom are aware of the updates deadline for each of the bi-weekly cycle. To remind them of the deadline, an email is sent usually a week before the update submission deadline and those project managers and project coordinators that have not submitted their updates on time will receive a phone call on the submission deadline day urging them to input their updates in the system. All updates submitted prior to the report issuance date are included in the final report. Having 53 projects that need to submit their updates takes a lot of effort and time from the side of the Reporting team to collect as many updates as possible before the report issuance date. Being aware that their existing process of requesting and collecting the project updates needs improvement, we partnered with the Reporting team to devise a behavioural intervention to increase submitting updates on time and improve the decision-making process by conducting a randomized control trial.
