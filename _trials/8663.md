abstract: "This project explores the adoption and diffusion of an online math curriculum (Connecta Ideas) designed to provide a remote learning environment among 4th to 6th grade students in Lima,Peru. 188 primary schools from the second lowest quintile of academic performance in Lima, Peru, are randomly assigned to four treatment arms: (i) an intensive teacher intervention that pairs some teachers with coordinators to assist with take-up and use, (ii) a low-cost teacher intervention that provides some teachers with virtual workshops to encourage take-up and use, (iii) a school-wide intervention providing virtual workshops to all teachers, and (iv) a control group that receives no treatment. We will examine which teachers are more likely to adopt the online math curriculum and how this educational technology is diffused to students and other teachers. "
