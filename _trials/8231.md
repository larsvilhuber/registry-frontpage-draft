abstract: "Muslim women are underrepresented in management positions in India and often lack the role models and networks needed to succeed in the professional world after college. We study a training and mentorship program that comprises monthly synchronous online sessions covering topics such as resume building, job interview prep, and career coaching, aimed at Muslim women who are in college or are young professionals in India. Through random assignment into the program among qualified applicants, we will evaluate how access to the skill development sessions and to Muslim female mentors affects participantsâ€™ self-efficacy and career preparedness. In addition, we will study the effect of peer learning and one-on-one executive coaching on these indicators.  "
