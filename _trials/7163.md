abstract: "Take-up of new technologies is often very slow, especially in developing countries. While the structure of social networks, information diffusion, and pricing of technologies have been investigated as potential causes, the role of restrictive social attitudes (including stigma, social norms and taboos) limiting optimal technology adoption has so far only received scarce attention. Yet, especially in areas of health - such as mental health care, HIV testing and menstrual management - restrictive social attitudes seem to play an important role in limiting people in their adoption of beneficial new technologies. To get a better understanding about how stigma, norms and cultural taboos limit the take up and use of advanced health technologies, we look at the generally stigmatized topic of menstruation in Bangladesh. We conduct a field experiment in a Bangladeshi garment factory to reduce the perceived and experienced stigma, norms and taboos around menstruation by encouraging female factory workers to openly discuss and exchange personal experiences about menstruation in a safe space. We then determine the effect of the discussion on the willingness to pay for and pick-up rates of a new menstrual health technology, an anti-bacterial menstrual underwear."
