abstract: "A natural field experiment is conducted to investigate the influence of a dummy evaluation category at the bottom of a feedback scale on effort provision and performance. Subjects work on a real effort task in two successive periods. A performance dependent bonus is paid for the first period. Performance is evaluated using three evaluation categories. The first category is awarded to the highest performing subjects while the lowest performing subjects are evaluated with a three. A fixed wage is paid in the second period.

Subjects are randomly assigned to one of two treatments. In treatment ND no dummy evaluation category is shown, i.e. subjects are shown the actual three evaluation categories. In treatment CD a 4th dummy evaluation category is shown. 

We hypothesize that average effort provision and performance is higher in treatment CD in the second period. We expect these effects to be strongest for those ranking lowest (third)."
