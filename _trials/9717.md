abstract: "We provide causal evidence on how beliefs about the sources of educational inequalities support for policies or initiatives that reduce education-related inequalities. We first elicit participants’ beliefs about how college attendance varies by socioeconomic status. Half of the participants will then receive the actual statistics, taken from Chetty et al. (2020). We then measure participants’ support for reducing income inequality between college and non-college graduates, support for educational reform policies, and willingness to donate to charities that promote access to higher education. This document outlines our plan for data analysis."
