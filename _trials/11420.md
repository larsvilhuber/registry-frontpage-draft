abstract: "Elementary school students have been taught so far in almost all subjects by a single teacher under class-based teacher assignments. Recently, the introduction of subject-based teacher assignments is widely discussed for the purpose of in-depth instruction by teachers with expertise in subject and reduction of teacher workload in Japan. Theoretically, the comparative advantage of subject-based teacher assignments is considered to increase educational effectiveness. Previous empirical studies, however, showed non-significant or adverse effects on learning outcomes. Thus, the impacts of subject-based teacher assignments remain unclear. This study, with the cooperation of a board of education of a prefecture in Japan, attempts to examine assignment of new part-time teachers specialized in math and science on learning outcomes in elementary schools, using a randomized control trial."
