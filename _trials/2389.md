abstract: "Although governments in low-income countries frequently outsource public good provision to the private sector, the political economy and governance issues in this sphere remain poorly understood. We study outsourced public good provision by a low-capacity state in the context of Kenyaâ€™s national Last Mile Connectivity Project, which aims to provide universal household electricity access by 2020 using World Bank and African Development Bank funding. We will collect rich administrative and spatial planning data on the construction process across hundreds of projects. We will complement this with novel field engineering assessments and household surveys to study the channels affecting leakage and technical construction of a nationwide infrastructure project."
