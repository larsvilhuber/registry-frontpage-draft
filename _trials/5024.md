abstract: "Recent epidemiologic studies have shown that household air pollution from cooking on inefficient biomass stoves is a major public health concern which causes between 2.8 and 4.2 million premature deaths every year (WHO 2014). LPG is one of the cleanest burning cooking fuels and has been shown to have a low climate impact throughout its life cycle. This research project aims to quantify the health and socioeconomic impacts of access to LPG for low income households in developing countries. It will be implemented in partnership with NGO Entrepreneurs du Monde (EdM) in a country where it is currently conducting a LPG promotion program.

A randomized controlled experiment will be conducted in 2022. It will involve a random sample of 823 households who will be assigned to one of three groups :
1      A ‘subsidy group’ in which households will be offered a 38% discount on the purchase of a LPG kit including a stove and a 6kg cylinder;
2.	A ‘credit group’ : the households assigned to this group will receive a sales offer enabling them to purchase the same kit in three installments (but at the standard market price);
3.    A ‘comparison group’ where households will not receive any offer.

29% of the households will be assigned to the 'subsidy group', 29% to the 'credit group' and 42% to the control group.

The research team will collect a combination of standard self-declared survey data and field measurements both before the intervention and  after the intervention (6 to 10 months after the intervention). Electronic Stove Usage Monitoring Systems  (SUMS) will be installed on LPG stoves to record their usage frequency during the whole study. Individual exposure to PM2.5 will be measured with ambiant air pumps and ‘light scattering sensors’ (24h gravimetric measurement) at baseline, midline and endline. The Kitchen Performance Test (KPT) Protocol will be used to assess the fuel consumption of the households over 24 hours to 3 days.

The collected data will allow to answer a series of questions concerning the determinants of LPG adoption (household characteristics, budget constraint, beliefs about cooking with wood or charcoal) and its impact on exposure to indoor air pollution, health and time use (women and children)."
