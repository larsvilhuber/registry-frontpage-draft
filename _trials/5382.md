abstract: "This project evaluates the impact of schools administered by Bridge International Academies in Kenya on a variety of student outcomes using a large-scale randomized scholarship experiment. The evaluation is centered on a scholarship program that selected 10,000 students chosen by a lottery from among about 25,000 applicants from pre-K to grade 7 to attend any of the 405 Bridge schools in Kenya starting in January 2016. The scholarship provided tuition for students to attend Bridge schools for two years.  "
