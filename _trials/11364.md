abstract: "We aim to assess the influence of ChatGPT and other advanced AI technologies on the labor market participation of students. We will conduct a brief survey on Prolific.co, targeting students to elicit their perceptions of their future earning potential. As an intervention, we will present "Positive News" and "Negative News" excerpts from a recent article discussing the potential impact of AI technologies on the economy and workers' earning prospects.

We will employ the analytical method developed by Möbius et al. (2022) to examine how participants revise their beliefs when presented with discussions about AI and its economic implications.
