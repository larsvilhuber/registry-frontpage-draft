abstract: "Substance use disorders (SUDs) impact millions of Americans ages 12 and older. In addition to individual suffering, SUDs impose substantial costs on society via health care costs, productivity losses, and increased crime rates. A resource that is particularly effective at assisting those in recovery from SUDs is recovery housing, a housing model designed to support individuals on their path to recovery with an emphasis on abstinence, peer support, and community building. One of the main obstacles to providing recovery housing, especially in rural communities, is stigma surrounding the house itself and the individuals within. Stigma may reduce the support for the establishment of recovery housing and associated recovery support services. Stigma has been defined as a misperception or misconception of risk or a situation in which negative emotions overwhelm any ability to rationally deliberate a decision.

The purpose of this study is two-fold. First, we will examine if the gender and race of an individual with a SUD affects support for recovery housing establishment, hypothetical support for policies, and social SUD stigma. Second, we will determine if a contact intervention, delivered via a written personal story of recovery can improve outcomes related to treatment support and SUD stigma, and reduce any gender or racial biases that may exist.
