abstract: "People who believe their intelligence and abilities can be developed over time have growth mindsets, while those that believe they cannot be developed, have fixed mindsets. Students with growth mindsets are predicted to perform better in academics, and to have higher psychological well-being compared to other students. Research suggest that student’s mindsets are malleable, and that level of growth mindset and academic performance can be increased through low-cost and easily scalable interventions. However, there is a lack of studies that focus on how we can support parents to promote the development of growth mindset in their children.

I will examine whether parents can learn to foster their children’s growth mindsets through an online intervention. Families with children in 1.-3. grade will be recruited through schools, and randomized to control or treatment within classrooms. I will investigate treatment effects on the parents and their children. For parents I will investigate the impact on their theory of intelligence; belief about fixedness of ability; perceived parental impact; failure mindset; praise mindset; criticism mindset; and challenge mindset. For the children I will investigate the impact on their growth mindset; epistemic curiosity (parent perceived); and arithmetical facts."
