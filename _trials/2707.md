abstract: "Economists debate whether markets have a tendency to erode moral values. While some studies show that subjects tend to decide less morally when being exposed to a market environment, other studies argue that the market mechanism can have the property to promote moral behavior. We add to this discussion by explicitly distinguishing between two moral concepts from philosophy: consequentialism and deontology. According to consequentialism, the morality of an action is evaluated by the consequences it causes. Following deontology, the morality of an action is evaluated by the action itself. 
We plan to conduct an online experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) using oTree to investigate the research question of how exactly the market mechanism influences moral decision making: Subjects in the control treatment (non-market) play a lottery game in the first stage and take a decision in a moral trolley problem in the second stage. Subjects in the experimental treatment (market) play a double auction game in the role of a seller or buyer in the first stage and take a decision in the same moral trolley problem in the second stage.
We then compare the share of consequentialist decisions in the moral trolley problem between the two treatments. We hypothesize that the market interaction promotes the concept of cost-benefit analysis and makes consequences more salient, leading to a higher share of consequentialist decisions in the market treatment.
An answer to the question whether markets lead to more consequentialism would yield an important contribution to the current debate on the influence of markets on morality.
