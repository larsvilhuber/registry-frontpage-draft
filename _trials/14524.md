abstract: "Indonesia has a weak political party system; most voters do not have a strong partisan identity and many political parties are not built on clear ideological platforms and do not take specific or consistent policy positions. Moreover, coalitions for regional executive elections in Indonesia often include ideologically distant parties that are opponents at the national level. Existing research similarly shows that a mix of factors, including policy platform and candidate quality (Fossati 2016) contribute equally to their vote choice. How, then, do voters decide which regional executive candidate to support when the coalitions backing them feature parties that are rivals at the national level? We answer this research question through a conjoint experiment that tests which policy, party, or candidate characteristics matter the most in affecting vote choice in regional executive elections â€“ including whether what candidates wear affects voter choice. The experiment presents respondents, who are Indonesian voters, with different hypothetical profiles of candidates for district governor  (bupati) or mayor (walikota) with randomized demographic, political, and career and family backgrounds. The study contributes to a growing literature on subnational political behavior in Indonesia. It will present a systematic test of characteristics that have been identified by the literature as meaningful, across the spectrum of policy positions, candidate characteristics, and party identity.
