abstract: "The football for development festival provided participants with basic knowledge on the use of sports and football to promote positive change within their communities through workshops delivered during four days. The main goal of the festival was to encourage participants to seek out ways they can become agents of change and apply what they learned. As previous research found, we don't always act on our intentions and therefore we explore whether setting out a plan and list of four goals can increase participants chances to act and bring about change in their communities after the festival. To encourage regular attendance, at the start of the festival, all participants took a pledge that they will attend the workshops and do their best to gain new knowledge and apply it for social good. The intervention proposed is to test whether using goal-setting in a WhatsApp group will sparkle participants' motivation and lead them to act on their intention to become agents of change.
