abstract: "This experiment is mainly based on the classical trust game. 
The main aim of this experiment is to explore the trusting and trustworthy behavior in different organizational structures. We would like to test whether the different organizational structures will influence the trustor's trusting behavior and the trustee's truthworthiness. 
The experiment contains five experimental groups.
We introduce different organizational structures in the trustees' groups. We used a 2×2 experiment design: parallel × vertical organizational structures, balanced in-group power × unbalanced in-group power. There are five different experiment groups in our design: 1. parallel-balanced, 2. parallel-unbalanced, 3. vertical-balanced, 4. vertical-unbalanced (from high to low), 5. vertical-unbalanced (from low to high). 
In each experiment unit, there are three participants, including one trustor and two trustees. The trustors will receive 10 EC when the experiment starts. First, the trustors have to decide the investment number to the trustee group. The investment number range is { 4, 6, 8, 10 } (EC). Then, the investment money will become 3 times the original investment and be given to the trustees. In the parallel groups, trustees will decide the return value at the same time, while in the parallel, one trustee makes a decision in advance, and then the other trustee could see her decision result and then makes her own decision. In the power-balanced groups, two trustees receive an equal amount of investment money, both 1.5 times of the original investment money that the trustor provides. In the power-unbalanced groups, one trustee receives 2 times the original investment money and is assigned as the "high power" trustee, while another trustee receives the investment money equal to the original investment money that the trustor provides and is assigned as the "low power" trustee. The trustor receives the return money from two trustees. 
This experiment repeats for 30 periods. The participants' experimental role changes every 10 periods and would not be repeated. It means that each participant will act in all kinds of experimental roles in a unit. In treatment 4, the trustee with low power acts in advance, and in treatment 5, the trustee with high power acts in advance."
