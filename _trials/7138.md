abstract: "Evidence is mounting that there is a substantial socio-economic gap in learning losses experienced by students as a result of widespread school closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This research evaluates the effectiveness of an online tutoring program aimed at students from highly disadvantaged schools in Spain. We will randomly assign students to tutors. Students will be taught in groups of two for a duration of eight weeks. We will evaluate the effect of the program both on cognitive as well as socio-emotional outcomes.
