abstract: "In Tanzania, as elsewhere, discoveries of valuable natural resources have shaped the political discourse. Promises of rapid economic growth and sharp decline in poverty have been made by the highest authorities. Some years later, the promises have not materialized. One important fear is that creating high, but unmet, expectations among the citizens may have negative effects, and may in particular prompt protests and episodes of violence.
We study this question experimentally, by randomly exposing citizens to different political discourses and information related to the petroleum explorations."
