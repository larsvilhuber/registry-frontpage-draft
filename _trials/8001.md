abstract: "Can existing public service delivery platforms be leveraged to implement early childhood development (ECD) interventions at scale for developing countries? We study a randomized controlled trial of an early childhood stimulation program that was integrated into Bangladesh's flagship public nutrition program without additional financial incentives for program delivery. The program targeted more than 18,000 children aged 3-18 months at baseline and was conducted in three divisions in Bangladesh. Both household and service provider surveys were carried out to shed light on supply and demand-side responses to the intervention. Key outcomes of interest for the target children were cognitive, language, and socio-economic skills as well as their anthropometric development."
