abstract: "This project will test impacts and compare costs of different modalities to inform parents and communities in poor rural Côte d’Ivoire of parental practices around stimulation, discipline, nutrition and preventive health to enhance early-life (age 0-5) education and learning, through two clustered randomized control trials. In a first RCT, parental training will target the main caregiver through formal in-group training sessions. In the second RCT, the intervention targets households with in-group training and home visits. We hypothesize that effectiveness depends on whether interventions sustainably shift"
