abstract: "Government support for childcare has been provided through financial subsidies and after-school care programs. Over the recent decades, numerous researchers have studied the effects of childcare policies on maternal labor supply, child development, and family well-being, given the substantial rise in maternal labor force participation rates. Several countries, including Canada, Sweden, Denmark and Germany, offer universal childcare. Expanding childcare service has several benefits: It can increase maternal labor supply. Additionally, public childcare expansion can replace private childcare, which may not change maternal employment but can reduce household spending on childcare. On the other hand, expanding childcare services requires significant public funding, leading to higher taxes and potentially reduced economic efficiency. 
We investigate the impact of Korea’s public childcare system expansion on maternal employment, child development, and the use of private tutoring services. In 2023, Korea recorded the lowest fertility rate globally, partly due to a working environment unfavorable to family life. Moreover, around 70% of parents send their children to private tutoring academies for better education and childcare, which has caused significant financial burdens. To address this, the Ministry of Education of Korea (MOE) recently expanded public childcare for children in primary schools, known as Neulbom schools. The government has integrated pre-existing after-school programs that separately offered learning opportunities and childcare services to students. 
Neulbom schools have two notable features compared to the pre-existing programs. First, they offer the two programs free of charge from 1PM to 3PM, tailored to younger students’ developmental needs. Students can decide to join the entire program or only receive care services. Second, these programs are provided to any students who would like to participate without any prioritization. The pre-existing services prioritized children from dual-income families, low-income households, single-parent families, and those recommended by teachers. Initially, Neulbom schools target first-grade students in the first semester of 2024. The MOE plans to gradually extend the benefits to grades 2 to 6 by 2026. Thus, those from grades 2 to 6 attending Neulbom schools still remain under the same restrictions as current childcare services. 
The introduction of Neulbom schools is exogenous to students and parents. The MOE released the list of participating schools two weeks before the semester begins, reducing the likelihood of parents transferring children due to the school's decision whether to participate in Neulbom schools. We exploit this quasi-experimental variations in the Neulbom schools to identify the causal effects of public childcare on maternal employment and child development, measured by children’s cognitive and non-cognitive abilities, life satisfaction and the use of private tutoring academies. We also examine the effects on workers hired by schools and the desired number of children, using detailed individual-level information collected through survey in the first half of this year. 
We receive financial support from the MOE of the Republic of Korea.
