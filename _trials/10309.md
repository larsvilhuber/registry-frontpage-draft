abstract: "We will randomly assign survey respondents to two groups. Half of our survey respondents will be assigned to the treatment group (T), for whom the survey section collecting information on household assets will figure early in the survey questionnaire. The other half of our survey respondents will be assigned to the control group (C), for whom the survey section collecting information on household assets will figure late in the survey questionnaire. We will split our respondents evenly between treatment and control groups to maximize statistical power."
