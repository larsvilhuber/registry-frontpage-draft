abstract: "One of the most difficult challenges facing education policy is reintegrating children who have dropped out of school. As children spend more time outside of school, addressing this public issue becomes more difficult. Previous studies have demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of information campaigns about the benefits of education in reducing school dropout rates, but little research has been done on the effectiveness of the same approach in bringing children back to school. In this study, we collaborated with Chile's Ministry of Education to create a digital curriculum that explains the benefits of finishing school and the wage disparities between people with different levels of education. We grant guardians of children who are not in school access to the online platform at random to see how it affects re-enrollment decisions."
