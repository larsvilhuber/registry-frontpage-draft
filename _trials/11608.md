abstract: "In contexts like Sub-Saharan Africa, where the public extension has faced significant challenges, private input suppliers could be leveraged to provide farmers with information on and access to new technologies. The current study tests whether input suppliers can be incentivized to promote newer and better maize varieties among farmers in Kenya. Specifically, the study uses an RCT design to test whether providing a monetary incentive in terms of a margin discount influences agro-dealers stocking decisions as well as their efforts toward encouraging their clients to try the newer varieties. The study is implemented in four counties in Kenya and works with three hundred and forty input suppliers located in one hundred local markets."
