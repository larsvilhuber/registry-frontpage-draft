abstract: "Farmers, agricultural scientists and other extension actors increasingly develop videos to help farmers improve their farming practices. Person-to-person video sharing (e.g. via WhatsApp groups) can facilitate scaling, trust and localization of these videos. We plan a randomized trial testing whether the gender of farmers featured in videos influences the scale and gender inclusivity of person-to-person sharing of these videos in rural Bihar. We will also analyze how these outcomes may be influenced by communication platforms and characteristics (role, age, gender, location and agricultural credibility) of video sharers."
