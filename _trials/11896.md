abstract: "While individuals often engage in morally right actions, they prioritize their self-interest over moral considerations. Previous research has shown that people often manipulate information processing to rationalize their egoistic behavior, using situational uncertainties as excuses to justify their choices. However, a crucial issue is whether individuals can recognize the excuse-based actions of others. The research investigates individuals’ ability to predict others’ behavior in risky decision-making. In our laboratory experiment, participants make a decision task and a prediction task. The decision task will assess participants’ excuse-driven risk preferences, while the prediction task will delve into their predictions regarding others’ behaviors under the same risk scenario. Our hypothesis suggests that individuals possess the capacity to anticipate the excuse-driven behavior of others, but they may underestimate the intensity of self-interested actions exhibited by their peers."
