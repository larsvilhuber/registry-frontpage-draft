abstract: "In this project, we study how gender gaps in hiring in a male-type environment vary depending on the use of “irrelevant” or “silly” interview questions, questions that are used in real-world interviews as ice-breakers or to get a general sense of an applicant’s personality, rather than being related to job-related skills or characteristics.
