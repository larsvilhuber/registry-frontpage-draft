abstract: "This lab experiment investigates how price controls in emissions permit markets affect incentives for the adoption of new technology that lowers abatement costs. A theoretical model shows that the investment incentives depend on (i) the specific placement of the price collar (defined by price ceilings and floors) and (ii) the size (width) of the collar. The experimental setting includes uncertainty in emissions and abatement costs, and heterogeneous firms. Firms are more likely to adopt the new technology when the collar raises the expected permit price relative to a no-price-control baseline, especially when the high collar is narrow. Conversely, adoption incentives are weaker when the collar lowers the expected permit price, especially when the low collar is narrow. Prices are determined using a uniform price, sealed bid auction. In the narrow collar treatments, the experiment implements the narrowest range possibleâ€”a fixed price equivalent to an emissions tax. "
