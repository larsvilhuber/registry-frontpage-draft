abstract: "For over two hundred years, people worldwide have taken to the streets and demanded democratic forms of government. Movements for democracy both establish political rights and shape the wealth of nations. This project studies citizens’ decisions to engage in political action, examining the population of Hong Kong, where the "Umbrella Revolution" of 2014 marked an escalation of Hong Kong citizens’ ongoing movement demanding democratic institutions from the Chinese Communist Party. In particular, this project studies three drivers of political action that shape a citizen’s political participation in a coordination game: (i) preferences: for example, risk preferences, preferences for redistribution, and generalized and specific trust; (ii) beliefs about the incumbent regime: for example, regarding its strength and its likely response to political protests; and, (iii) beliefs about other citizens’ beliefs: in a coordination game, these second-order beliefs play a crucial role in determining behavior for a given set of citizen preferences and beliefs about the regime."
