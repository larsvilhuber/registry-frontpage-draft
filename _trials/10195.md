abstract: "This intervention aims to estimate the effectiveness of information to promote migrant registration in the social registry Sisbén and to explore the role of social capital for this purpose. The Colombian government uses Sisbén to classify the population according to their economic and social situation and target social programs. Qualitative evidence has shown multiple barriers to migrants’ registration in this database, which may preclude their visibility and potential eligibility for social assistance. In the first phase of the study, we randomly assign a sample of Venezuelan migrants into a control group and two treatment groups: i) a group that receives information on the process of Sisbén registration via SMS; and ii) a group that receives the same information on Sisbén registration via WhatsApp. In the second phase of the study, which is not an experiment, another group of Venezuelan migrants receives messages via WhatsApp inviting them to refer their Sisbén information with their friends thus to study information diffusion and social capital. We expect the results to shed light on how to eliminate the documented barriers and misinformation that leads to not registering for Sisbén using cost-effective communication methods, and help trace out the importance of social networks among displaced Venezuelans living in Colombia."
