abstract: "We investigate the effectiveness of schemes to pay farmers to take actions that reduce phosphorus pollution entering rivers in two catchments.  In one catchment, we compare a fixed price scheme to a pay-as-bid reverse auction.  In the other, we compare a fixed price scheme to a uniform price reverse auction."
