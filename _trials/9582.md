abstract: "I examine firstly whether individuals pay to avoid dissonant information and secondly if the amount they are willing to pay varies based on their prior exposure to dissonant information and their beliefs.  In experiments with US respondents, participants were randomly allocated to an article to read that either agreed with or opposed their prior self-reported beliefs. The participants then answered some incentivized questions based on the article they were assigned to. Subsequently, all participants were allocated to a second article that was inconsistent with their prior beliefs but were then provided with the option to pay to switch the conflicting article with one that is consistent with their beliefs. Participants were then asked to quantify the monetary value they were willing to forgo in order to switch articles. I measure the proportion of participants who were willing to pay to avoid completing an effort task on a dissonant article and their maximum willingness to pay to avoid it. Finally, I compare the proportion of people who are willing to pay to switch articles and the amount they are willing to pay to switch articles depending on their beliefs and their prior exposure to a dissonant view.
