abstract: "We conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the impact of on-the-job soft skills training for supervisors on line productivity, worker attendance, and psychological well-being in five garment factories in Bangladesh. Line supervisors and chiefs are randomly selected to receive either ten sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy featuring effective communication and stress management techniques; ten health information sessions (active control intervention), or no intervention (pure control group). We measure stress levels using biomarkers (hair cortisol) and self-reported data. We also measure on-the-job productivity, income, absenteeism, and hours of work. "
