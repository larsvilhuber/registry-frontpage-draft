abstract: "Ninety-eight percent of households in Uganda rely on biomass and charcoal fuels for cooking. This heavy reliance on biomass fuels has negative effects on public health, womenâ€™s empowerment, and local and global environments. In response, the government of Uganda has made increasing access to electric cooking a national priority and targets 50% adoption by 2025. This study seeks to evaluate strategies to promote the use of electric cooking appliances. Specifically we aim to understand the usage of a highly efficient electric cooking appliance, the electric pressure cooker (EPC), in Ugandan households. Using a randomized experiment, we study how household energy use and cooking decisions are affected by changes in electricity prices and cooking energy use information. "
