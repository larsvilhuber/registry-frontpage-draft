abstract: "In this study, we extend the evidence for the relationship between identify (in terms of pro-environmental attitudes) and charitable giving. We conduct a discrete-choice experiment with randomized information treatments in a sample of about 400 students in the UK. Our expected outcome is that respondents who are subject to a treatment that evokes a recollection of “environmentally bad” behavior are more likely to cleanse by donating to a charity."
