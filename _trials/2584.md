abstract: "Unnecessary injections increase the risk of blood borne infections as well as pose an avoidable financial burden on patients. Perceptions in rural Cambodia that non-illicit medical drug injections are the best quality of medical care have resulted in a high proportion of the population seeking these injections across medical conditions. As private providers have a higher propensity to offer injections, patients pursue more expensive care contributing to greater financial burden on patients. This study aimed to use an educational intervention to improve participant knowledge about injections and health insurance in order to build informed trust in safer injection practices and health insurance. Using a quasi-experimental study design, villages in rural Cambodia were randomly assigned to an intervention or control arm. Community educational workshops were implemented to improve participant knowledge about injections and health insurance. Pre-and post-intervention assessments were used to record the resulting changes in knowledge and trust in providers. Statistical analysis of these survey results from the two study arms showed increases of 16.8% and 15.6% in study participant knowledge regarding injections and health insurance, respectively. Trust in health insurance increased by 12.9%. However, trust in health care providers proved to be resilient with small to no change. These results show that knowledge about injection safety and health insurance, as well as trust in health insurance, can be increased through information dissemination in rural Cambodia. However, health information campaigns may not easily influence people’s trust in healthcare providers. Education of the general populace about safe injection practices and health insurance can contribute toward the country’s efforts to reach universal health coverage.
