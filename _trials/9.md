abstract: "This project evaluates an innovative policy intervention which aims at enhancing supply of public employment in Bihar, a state where the Indian employment guarantee faces severe implementation challenges. The new system of funds transfer and expenditures tracking is rolled out in randomly selected phases across Bihar districts. If the intervention successfully increases spending, we will use it as a way to evaluate the impact of NREGA on people's lives.  Detailed field surveys will measure the effect of increased access to public employment on households’ consumption smoothing and migration decisions, as well as its effect on private labour contracts and wages. Since the intervention could also reduce corruption by linking  more directly fund flow to payroll, we will also be looking at potential impacts on ghost workers and other measures of corruption. "
