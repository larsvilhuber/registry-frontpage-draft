abstract: "Most research on mentoring and tutoring programs has primarily concentrated on how such relationships benefit the mentees. However, there is a notable lack of studies examining the effects on the mentors themselves. This study addresses this gap by assessing the impact of a mentoring program on the social skills of the mentors. Leveraging  randomized control trial conducted in public schools in Bogota, Colombia, this research examines the outcomes of pairing university students with public school students for one year. These pairs consist of individuals from differing socio-economic backgrounds, with the public school students generally from low-income families and the mentors from middle- to high-income families. By exploring this unique setup, the study aims to determine how mentorship that facilitates intergroup contact between different socio-economic groups affects prosocial behaviors, including attitudes toward generosity and trust towards low-income people, aversion to inequality, and support for redistribution policies."
