abstract: "Personal relationships have a great effect in many aspects in our life; particularly, during our school years, friendship is a key factor for many individuals. On the other hand, performance during these years, specially the years just previous to entering the university.
We want to identify how the relationship with different classmates can affect performance when working in group, and how best pair these students to improve their knowledge process. We will also study gender differences when setting these groups and differences in their performance.
Finally, we will look at other aspects related both with relationships and performance, such as the effect of bullying or generosity towards your peers."
