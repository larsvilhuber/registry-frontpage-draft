abstract: "This study looks at socially differentiated preferences for bundled livestock insurance products. It exposes pastoralists in northern Kenya to information about bundled products and provides forecasts of vegetation conditions. We seek to elicit pastoralists' preferences using an incentive compatible choice experiment and implement a randomized evaluation to assess the role of information on the preferences."
