abstract: "To study intergenerational discounting, we perform an online survey in which the respondent is asked to answer how much he or she is willing to swap the current consumption with the consumption of a person in the distant future. The subjects will be randomly assigned to the control and the treatment, in the latter of which a piece of information on climate change is provided.
