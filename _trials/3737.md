abstract: "Scarcity in financial resources appears to tax the cognitive performance of the poor, and there are indications that cash inflows can cause cognitive boosts. This suggests that cash transfers can have an enabling effect on tasks that demand cognitive resources. For example, as cognitive load impedes schema adoption, cash transfer interventions may enhance the effectiveness of psychological interventions aimed at altering schematic cognitions. This suggests (perhaps counterintuitively) that when the two interventions are bundled, cash transfers should lead rather than trail psychological interventions. More generally, if bundling of the two interventions leads to synergies, the short-term cognitive impacts of cash transfers may be one explanation."
