abstract: "The aim of this experiment is to test whether biased income expectations due to overconfidence lead to higher levels of debt-taking. We exogenously vary subject’s income expectation by letting income depend on relative performance (rank) in hard and easy quiz tasks. The so called “hard easy gap” leads us to expect that subjects have higher income expectations in the easy task than in the hard task. Before subjects receive feedback on their income they can make consumption decisions using a loan. In a third treatment we assign income randomly in order to assess how much debt subjects take out when they have unbiased information over expected income. Additionally we measure subject’s risk preferences, self-control, and financial literacy."
