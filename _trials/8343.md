abstract: "Although fake online customer reviews have become prevalent on platforms such as TripAdvisor, eBay, and Amazon, little is known about how these reviews influence consumer behavior. This paper provides the first causal estimates of the effects of fake reviews on individual consumption choices. We conduct an incentive compatible online experiment with a nationally representative sample of UK respondents (n = 10,000). Participants are asked to browse a platform resembling Amazon and to choose a product. We randomly allocate different participants to variants of the platform with different types of fake reviews. Our analysis of the experimental data yields three key findings. First, fake reviews make consumers more likely to choose poor-quality products. Second, the effect of fake reviews is smaller for those who do not trust customer reviews. Third, we show that educational interventions can help reduce the effects of fake reviews."
