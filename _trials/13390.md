abstract: "In many developing countries, women-owned businesses face distinct challenges compared to those owned by men. This study examines the differential role of soft skills in the performance of female and male-owned businesses, as well as its impact on household decisions. To analyze changes in soft skills, we utilize a gender-stratified randomized controlled trial involving 2,545 rural entrepreneurs from the state of Tamil Nadu, India. Half of the sample was randomly assigned to a personal initiative training program. We aim to test the impacts of the intervention on the entrepreneurs*'* soft skills, financial access*,* and business growth*. Since the functioning of businesses of women is more likely to be intertwined with their household dynamics*, we will also estimate the indirect impact of the intervention on the spouses of the entrepreneurs, as well as other household investments and decisions."
