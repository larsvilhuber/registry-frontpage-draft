abstract: "This research project aims to investigate the effect of informing individuals about the link between inflation and social inequality on their preferences for redistributive policies. Additionally, the study seeks to explore different mechanisms, particularly cognitive dissonance, that may explain the relationship between information exposure and attitudes toward redistribution. This topic holds significant importance in the field of economics as it addresses crucial questions about the role of the type of information (i.e. inflation) in shaping attitudes towards pro-redistributive policies and its directions, and how cognitive dissonance may influence individuals' responses to this information.
To achieve this, a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) will be conducted, dividing participants into different groups and measuring their responses to various informational stimuli. A group of individuals should also receive opposite information which illustrates the theoretical negative effect of highly redistributive policies and economic growth. While we expect that informing about the positive relationship between inflation and inequality could move individualsâ€™ opinions more prone to support redistributive policies, it is also expected that informing about the potential negative impact of pro-redistributive policies on economic growth can lead opinions in the opposite direction. The experiment is thought to give subjects the option to choose what type of information they want to read.
