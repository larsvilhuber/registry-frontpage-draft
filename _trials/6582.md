abstract: "The evidence on the effectiveness of participatory development approaches in low-income countries is ambiguous. We randomly vary three governance modalities (internal monitoring, external or top-down monitoring, and rewards for good leadership) to study elite capture in Ethiopian forest user groups. We  compare the livelihood, leadership quality and environmental outcomes of these governance modalities with the control group (the current governance system)."
