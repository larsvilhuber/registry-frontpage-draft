abstract: "Medical male circumcision has drawn substantial attention as one of most effective HIV/AIDS prevention strategies since three studies proved that male circumcision can reduce HIV transmission risk by up to 50 percent (Auvert et al., 2005; Bailey et al., 2007; Gray et al., 2007). However, although male circumcision can reduce the infection risk in the short run, it does not eliminate an individual’s risk of infection.  That is, circumcised men may participate in riskier sexual behaviors if they perceive reduction in risk following the procedure, and thus mitigate the direct preventive effect of male circumcision. 
The purpose of this study is to investigate the causal relationship between medical male circumcision for secondary school students in Malawi and their risky sexual behaviors and infection of STDs after 3-4 years. We randomly provided free male circumcision surgery and transportation subsidies to 3,974 boys (9th-11th grade) at 124 classrooms of 33 public schools in Malawi. We can conduct a comprehensive examination of men’s behavioral change and the mechanism on how they compensate their reduced risk after circumcision by exploiting biomarkers and a variety of novel measures for sexual responses in the long-term.
