abstract: "The goal of the study is to determine whether clinical decision support (CDS) for outpatient radiology affects the number, type, or appropriateness of targeted high-cost radiology images (i.e. MR and CT) ordered. The CDS will be delivered to outpatient physicians in the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. It will be delivered in Epic, an industry-standard electronic medical record software, through ACRSelect, which is a leading decision support tool based on the American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria  (see http://www.acr.org/Quality-Safety/Appropriateness-Criteria), and presents the ACR appropriateness scores for each image on a scale of 1-9 with 1-3 labelled as ‘usually not appropriate’, 4-6 ‘May be appropriate’, and 7-9 ‘usually appropriate’."
