abstract: "People with depression or anxiety, the most common mental illnesses, often deal with prejudice and unfavorable treatment at work. This could have economic costs if they are discriminated against relative to other equally-productive workers, or treated differently by coworkers in ways that harm productivity. How much does this happen, as opposed to discrimination just reflecting these disorders' direct effects on productivity? This project uses an online experiment to investigate discriminatory behavior towards depressed or anxious coworkers in a collaborative problem-solving task. I estimate discrimination in the preference for working with a person and in in-task behaviors, investigate the mechanisms behind such discrimination and its effects on earnings, and finally consider how this relates to the willingness of participants to reveal information about their mental illness.
