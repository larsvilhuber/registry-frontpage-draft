abstract: "We design a new experiment to measure the effect of time pressure on performance in cognitive tasks as well as individual preferences for working under time pressure. In the experiment, participants first solve adding-numbers games under different time limits and then choose their own payment schemes. Our within-subject design allows us to look into individual heterogeneity in the ability to perform under time pressure. Results from our experiment could shed light on the use of time pressure as an incentive device and lay the groundwork for future research into the ability to deal with time pressure as an individual trait that is relevant for education and labor market outcomes."
