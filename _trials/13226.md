abstract: "How do people reason and decide when it comes to voting for minimum wage increases? Do low-wage workers think that the higher rate, the better, or do they take into account disemployment effects of minimum wages while making their policy choices? For high-wage workers who would not be affected by the increases, do they care more about workers, small businesses, or the overall economy? In addition, are those factors different between liberal and conservative individuals? My study will shed some light on the mental maps that determine individuals' support for minimum wages. To further investigate those channels, I implement information provision treatments: providing people information on the bindingness of the minimum wage in their state and the unemployment rate in their state. Finally, to shed some light on the link between perceptions on the labor markets and policy choices, I implement a hypothetical experiment to study whether people would demand a higher minimum wage rate or a lower minimum wage rate when the economy is not doing well or under crisis."
