abstract: "Schools serving over 1.5 billion children globally have mandated temporary closures due to coronavirus. The COVID-19 pause on in-person schooling threatens to exacerbate learning poverty around the world.  Much ongoing scholarship on minimizing coronavirus learning loss understandably focuses on online learning. However, many young people have no access to internet at home or at school. Given access challenges, how can schools support the hard-to-reach learners most likely to fall behind? This study examines the effectiveness of academic support using a relatively basic technology—teacher-student phone calls. We will examine the causal effect of phone calls in Kenya on student engagement, school connectedness, and academic achievement. We will test two types of calls with different design features to understand the optimality of different types of remote support. In particular, this study has two treatment branches: the “accountability” arm, which will test short calls that encourage children to keep engaging with other remote resources provided to them , and the “tutoring” arm, which will test longer calls that include all the features of the accountability arm plus a short lesson on a grade-appropriate topic."
