abstract: "In an experiment that combines survey and field observations, we examine the effectiveness of different framings of the pro-environmental messages in the promoting pro-environmental behavioral changes in the highly hedonic context of tourism. We experimentally manipulate the assignment of two framings, i.e., a normative framing and a hedonic framing, in a survey targeting tourists on ferry trips in Vietnam. We set to examine with framing is more effective in changing actual behavior of tourist with actual behavioral measures from the field and the heterogeneity in the treatment effects with regard to hedonic motives held by the tourists.
