abstract: "Diarrheal disease and acute respiratory infection result in two million child deaths per year worldwide (WHO 2013) and the physical and cognitive stunting of millions more. Caused by fecal and bacterial contamination, public health officials argue that handwashing with soap is the most cost-effective tool against such contamination. However, campaigns have met with consistent failure in engendering sustained behavioral change, suffering from two major weaknesses: (1) an inability to credibly measure handwashing; and (2) an incapacity to untangle the mechanisms behind the initial behavioral failure. In partnership with the MIT Media Lab, we develop a time-stamped sensor that unobstrusively measures household handsoap use. With this high frequency measurement tool, we examine three behavioral interventions targeted towards young children in an RCT setup in which control households receive a standard public health information campaign only: (1) a dispenser arm, in which the household is also provided with a foaming dispenser and soap; (2) a monitoring arm, in which the household is also informed that their behavior is being tracked by the dispenser and receives biweekly reports on performance; and (3) an incentive arm, in which the household is informed it is being tracked and receives discrete incentives for daily handwashing performance. The design is embedded within the classic habit loop of trigger, routine, and reward: the trigger is an agreed-upon mealtime against which performance is evaluated; the routine is handwashing with soap, and the reward is either clean hands only, a satisfied conscience (monitoring), or a monetary incentive. Within the two latter arms, some households are told that they will receive a future boost in their monitoring or incentive services; this allows us to examine the habit formation process against the standard model of rational addiction. External interventions (monitoring and incentives) will be removed after three months, but household dispenser use will continue to be tracked for one year to measure the precise patterns of habit formation. At the six month mark, households will be cross-randomized into an additional reminder arm, in which alarm clocks programmed for the daily meal time are attached to their dispensers, thereby enhancing the saliency of the trigger and examining limited attention. In conjunction with the high frequency dispenser use data, we will collect biweekly child health data on diarrhea and ARI incidence, as well as detailed anthropometric, blood, and stool data at endline.
