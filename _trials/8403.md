abstract: "This field experiment informs the broader question about the effects of competition by state-owned firms on market outcomes. The study design is motivated by two facts. On the one hand, substantial price differences have been documented across private and public pharmacies. On the other hand, few consumers have registered and purchased products from the latter, despite being eligible to it. The goal of the field experiment was to study whether (lack of) information about public pharmacies affected awareness about it, pharmacy choice patterns, and perception about local politicians (who are accountable for their implementation)."
