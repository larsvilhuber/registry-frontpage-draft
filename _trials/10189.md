abstract: "We are evaluating a direct digital payment system. Payments are provided directly to vulnerable Afghan Women. The fundamental goal is to provide humanitarian assistance directly using a modality that is not easily captured by an authoritarian government hostile to western powers - the Taliban. The situation in Afghanistan is dire; the UNDP estimates that an astonishing 97% of Afghans are at risk of falling beneath the poverty line, fueling hunger, malnutrition, and increased migration borne of desperation. Our team has secured funding to provide transfers of 4,000 AFA every two weeks to around 2,400 Afghan women for two months. Beneficiaries will be randomized into two groups. The first group of about 1,225 participants will receive payments immediately, the second group will start receiving payments after two months at which point payments to the first group will conclude. The study focuses on impacts on immediate food and humanitarian needs and on whether the payments are captured by the Taliban.  "
