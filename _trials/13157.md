abstract: "This project examines a government form that is used to apply for an income support payment. BETA has conducted user testing and reviewed existing literature in order to draft updates to the form. This survey experiment will evaluate how the updates to the form influence the allocation of the payment. We will compare the existing form with two ‘active choice’ treatment conditions. The efficacy of the updated forms will be judged by how much of the payment participants allocate to one member of a (fictional) couple. BETA’s survey experiment will sit in a broader survey being run by a university for a government agency. Findings from this research will be shared with relevant government agencies to guide future updates to the form. Findings will also be published on the BETA website.
