abstract: "Recent models of decision making posit that deviations from risk aversion are driven by salience perception. However, this link between perception and behavior has not been directly tested. In this paper, three axioms are proposed to characterize properties of salience perception. These axioms are tested in a salience perception task. Participants then made a series of choices between lotteries. Participants with greater sensitivity to larger differences in the perception task were significantly more likely to prefer long-shot lotteries in the decision task. The findings support the predicted link between salience perception and skewness preference in choices under risk. "
