abstract: "This study analyzes the effectiveness of a dual apprenticeship program implemented as part of the Youth Employment and Skills Development Project (PEJEDEC) in Cote d'Ivoire.The dual apprenticeship program offers a subsidy paid directly to the apprentice, and complements practical on-the-job training with mentoring and theoretical training. The experiment simultaneously randomizes whether apprenticeship positions opened by firms are filled through the program, and whether interested youths are assigned to a dual apprenticeship. The study has two parts. The objective of the first part of the study is to document short-term impacts of apprenticeships on youths and firms, including to analyze whether the dual apprenticeship program induces substitution effects on youths and firms. The objective of the second part of the study is to measure impacts of apprenticeship on youth in the medium-term, after their exit from the program. "
