abstract: "This study using a Randomized Control Trial examines the impact of spousal leisure walks on time use, gender norms and violence n households in Kanpur, India. The study is conducted for married couples in rural and urban areas in Kanpur, India. The treated married couples walk for at least 3 times a week for at least 30 minutes, while the control group does not. We will examine the effects of this activity on time spent in labor market activity, spousal socio-economic decision making, gender norms around home production and unpaid care and domestic violence in the household.
