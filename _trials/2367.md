abstract: "We use a randomized controlled field experiment to examine the relative effectiveness of information in influencing residential energy consumption in Bangladesh. We assess the role of information on energy consumption by testing the effects of the following information: (i) expert advice on electricity conservation; (ii) (average) electricity consumption of others in the city; and (iii) own electricity consumption relative to neighborsâ€™.
