abstract: "Promoting green (usually more costly) product consumption is one important element in building a sustainable society. In times of high inflation, not only budget constraints but also the fear that prices will continue to rise might limit the effectiveness of exerted efforts to 
promote sustainable behaviors. Based on a representative survey, a framed field and a survey experiment, we show that high inflationary environments have a negative impact on organic product consumption for individuals with below-median environmental attitude. The perception of organic being luxury products and the social norm of buying organic are the likely mechanisms driving the observed effect."
