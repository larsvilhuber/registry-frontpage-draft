abstract: " Whistleblowers play an integral role in oversight. In almost every employment sector, organizational insiders who come forward to expose alleged wrongdoing are protected against formal retaliation and in some cases monetarily compensated. Yet there is one area where whistleblowers are not protected and face steep fines and jail sentences for coming forward: national security. Why? We argue that the difficulty of verifying allegations of wrongdoing in the national security arena make it impossible to condition rewards and punishments on the veracity of whistleblowers' claims. In such cases, harsh punishments prove effective for encouraging honest whistleblowing. We rely on mechanism design to specify these claims formally and investigate the implications using a novel survey experiment."
