abstract: "Equal opportunity has wide applicability throughout society. It touches upon access to education, employment, legal representation, etc. Given that equal opportunity has different meanings to different people (i.e., equal opportunity in outcomes, resources, access, etc.), we use a simplified definition based on the different types of equal opportunity mentioned in Arneson (2018). We define equal opportunity to mean that individuals should have similar access to “resources” except when one’s innate ability leads to a difference in resource allocation.

This project explores how economic inequality created by an institution affects productivity, and how productivity resulting from the institutional structure affects views on fairness and redistribution. We do this by setting up a controlled laboratory experiment in a two-person competitive environment consisting of a real-effort task where we vary the amount of time subjects have to perform the task. We use time as a resource in our competitive environment and we vary the amount of resources to compete under institutions that provide an advantage to subjects based on different inequality sources. More specifically we set up two inequality institutions that provide an advantage to the higher performer or the lower performer individual in the group during a baseline phase. The control condition has the same amount of time for both participants. 

The pre-analysis plan includes details on the structure of the experiment and our empirical strategy.
