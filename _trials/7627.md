abstract: "We conduct a correspondence test in the market for shared housing to identify the magnitude of ethnic and gender discrimination and the role of personal information posted on a social media platform. About 4,900 fictitious applications with a randomly assigned Turkish-, or German-sounding female or male name will be sent to vacant room ads. In addition, we randomly add a link to a social media profile to determine the effect of such personal information on callback rates. We carefully constructed these fictional social media accounts on Instagram for over the course of two years to make them as realistic as possible, conducting several surveys among young people to ensure that the profiles are close to reality with a sufficient number of followers. Unlike previous research, we can approximate whether landlords or roommates actually visit these profiles and exploit this information using statistics on profile visits and page impressions."
