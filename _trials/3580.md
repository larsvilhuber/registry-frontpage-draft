abstract: "We define a class of donations termed quantity donations and present evidence from an online field experiment on whether well-known results from the literature on subsidizing charitable giving generalize to this class. In the quantity donation, donors choose how many units of a charitable good to fund, rather than the amount of money to give. With this small modification, we find that rebate and matching subsidies are equally effective in raising funds, which contrasts the common result of matches being superior. This outcome masks a higher likelihood of giving under rebates and larger donations under matches. A third subsidy type framed as discount off the per-unit price of the charitable good is just as effective. Our findings challenge the generalizability of established results on subsidy instruments and emphasize the role of small changes in the donation environment."
