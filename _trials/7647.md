abstract: "The goal of this study is to determine the effectiveness of default nudges, direct payments, and lottery payments in increasing vaccine acceptance. We will conduct a single survey where participants are exposed to one of two choice architecture treatments and then one of two financial incentive treatments. In the choice architecture treatments participants will either see a default nudge treatment, where they must opt out of taking the vaccine by cancelling a premade appointment, or an active choice treatment, where they can choose to take the COVID-19 vaccine by making an appointment or going to a walk-in clinic. Participants will then see a direct payment treatment or a lottery treatment. We will determine the proportion of the student population that would take the vaccine under these different hypothetical scenarios.
