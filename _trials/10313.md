abstract: "Evidence from Pakistan (Shonchoy et al., 2020) and Zambia (Fink et al., 2017) suggests that growth posters installed inside the household can be a cost-effective measure to improve nutritional outcomes by increasing salience, changing the parents’ reference for healthy norms and/or helping them better understand the returns to better nutritional inputs. In this proposed policy pilot, we will utilize a cluster-randomized trial design in rural Sindh of Pakistan, which has an under-five stunting rate of over 60%. We plan to test the efficacy of the intervention in a rural setting with intervention variations utilizing light-touch (automated voice-call nudges promoting poster use) against heavy-handed program delivery (community health workers visiting households) to facilitate frequent growth monitoring. We are teaming up with an NGO implementation partner Rural Support Programmes Network (RSPN), which is currently working closely with the Government of Sindh (GoS). Our research findings will help GoS improve the existing program design combating early childhood malnutrition. "
