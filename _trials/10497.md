abstract: "The project aims at investigating the effect of a role model intervention on students' educational and career aspirations and choices. We focus on schools located in the rural are of Hungary. Students of these schools have a higher probability of being “Not in Education, Employment, or Training” after leaving school than students in the urban area. Potential reasons for the insufficient educational attainment are unrealistic expectations about the costs and benefits of education, insufficient information about potential educational paths, low self-confidence, and a lack of role models whose path students could follow. Our project provides these role models by organizing classroom visits of volunteers who share their careers and educational journey."
