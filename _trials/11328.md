abstract: "Many businesses in Sub-Saharan Africa choose to employ relatives. A common understanding of this phenomenon is that this reflects information assymetries or benefits to hiring from one’s network that alleviate moral hazard.  In this project, I propose a different hypothesis: that some of this hiring may be driven by social norms or redistributive pressures, which maybe exacerbated by greater moral hazard among members of one’s network. I design a field experiment to examine the relevance of these redistributive pressures generating hiring distortions among Zambian microenterprises. I offer microenterprise owners a subsidy to hire an additional employee, and ask business owners to decide between hiring a relative or a non-relative candidate for the position. Microenterprise owners then make their choice under two conditions: a control condition, in the owner receives a poster explaining that they received a subsidy to hire a person and a treatment condition, in which employers are told that if they receive a subsidy, they will be given a poster explaining  the subsidy AND that many business owners offered this subsidy do not have complete control over who is hired with the subsidy. The treatment poster is designed to provide business owners with plausible deniability for not hiring a particular employee, as compared to natural hiring conditions. I then test how the identity of the employee chosen changes under this treatment. The experiment outlined in this pre-registration is one that explores the hypothesis. An additional  experiment involving rural employers may also be conducted as part of the same project (subject to budget and logistical constraints).
