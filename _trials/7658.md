abstract: "This project aims to offer clues on the behavioral motives that affect financial decision-making by individuals. We evaluate the randomized administration of behaviorally motivated SMS messages and renegotiation options implemented by a financial institution. The treatments will include behaviorally motivated texts intended to nudge non-business clients into debt repayment. Thus, our trial will test out the effectiveness of behaviorally motivated messages, the relative effectiveness of different behavioral motives and the interaction of these two elements with renegotiation options. This way, through randomization and a period of monitoring and follow-up on clients, this project hopes to identify the most effective behavioral motives for financial nudges in relation to repayment outcomes and to clients with varying levels of risk for financial institutions."
