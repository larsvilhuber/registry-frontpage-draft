abstract: "A key premise of models of rational inattention is that, due to limited attentioin, decision-makers pay attention to relevant information and ignore irrelevant news. What information do consumers care about when making economic decisions? Do they use the information they pay attention to when making macroeconomic expectations and consumption-saving decisions? To answer these questions, we conduct a survey with randomized control trail. Our results can also show whether consumers have Phillips Curve, Okun's Law, Taylor's Rule in their minds."
