abstract: "Within this study we investigate if there is a Hawthorne effect from using eye-trackers in laboratory experiments. We will be using commonly used economic games accompanied by eye-tracking equipment at Texas A&M University. The games to be used include the Trust (investment) game (Berg et al., 1995), Risk games: Holt and Laury Lottery Choice game (2002) and Eckel and Grossman (2012) Lottery Choice game, Public Goods game (Andreoni, 1995), Dictator game (Anderson et al., 2018), Ultimatum game (Anderson et al., 2011), and Double Auction (market) game (Smith, 1964). Texas A&M students will be contacted to be subjects through the university “bulkmail” system. When subjects arrive at the laboratory, they will sign a consent form and choose a numbered disk of out a box. This number corresponds with the eye-tracking station number that they will be seated at. Half the subjects will have the eye-tracking equipment calibrated to their eye movements and the other half the subjects will not have eye-tracking equipment calibrated to their eye movements (but the equipment will still be present). Before each game, the equipment will be calibrated, or recalibrated, to the subjects. Subjects will play games and once complete will answer demographic survey and debrief. Upon completion, subjects will be paid their earnings in private."
