abstract: "In this study, I examine the effect of awakening people’s awareness of the rationalities of selfless behavior on their actual willingness to share (split) rewards. The trial is a combination of a behavioural experiment (classroom setting) with the observations of reciprocal and sharing behavior from prior studies. At the core of the experiment is a version of the prisoner’s dilemma, the „split or steal” game, played in two shots, with the intervention for the treatment group in-between. A higher increase of „split” choices in the treatment arm than in the control arm would support the hypothesis that the awareness of rational selflessness increases individual’s marginal propensity to reciprocate."
