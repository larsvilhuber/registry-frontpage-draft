abstract: "This study will address two interconnected challenges in consumer research: the methodological question of eliciting consumer valuations that are in line with market and the practical issue of consumer acceptance for antibiotic-treated citrus. As the U.S. citrus industry battles Huanglongbing (HLB), understanding consumer reactions to antibiotic treatments is crucial. We propose a novel experimental design comparing Game Structure Obvious (GSO) and Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) mechanisms in eliciting consumer willingness to pay for antibiotic-treated citrus. Additionally, we will examine how information about disease severity affects consumer support for antibiotic treatment in citrus production. This study extends recent theoretical work on preference elicitation mechanisms to field settings while providing actionable insights for agricultural policy and public health regarding antibiotic use in crop production."
