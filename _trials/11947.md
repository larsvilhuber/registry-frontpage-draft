abstract: "We experimentally examine how the decisions of individuals with heterogenous true states of the world are interactively influenced by self-experience, professional suggestions and non-instrumental social information, and individuals react to contradictory information between information sources. Our main research found an important factor: information congruence between information sources significantly affects the evolution of the decisions in a group. Moreover, we surprisingly found stronger irrational herding (following the social consensus) when the official suggestions were private personalized information. The possible application of advice mechanisms is discussed based on simulation. "
