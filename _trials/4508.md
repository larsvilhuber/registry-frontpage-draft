abstract: "This study evaluates a Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) intervention that offers financial rewards for reducing burning of crop residue or 'stubble' among paddy farmers in Punjab, India. In addition to evaluating a standard PES contract, we will compare it to a contract that offers some of the payment upfront (without attempts to recoup it if the farmer does not meet the conditions). Adding this (de facto) unconditional component could increase overall cost-effectiveness if it increases compliance with the conditions, for example by easing liquidity constraints or by increasing participants' trust that the conditional payment will indeed be paid. PES with an upfront component might instead decrease cost-effectiveness because people who do not meet the conditions will receive some payment. The main outcome is whether the farmer burned his or her fields. Other outcomes are enrollment in the program, child respiratory health, and use of agricultural equipment and other inputs."
