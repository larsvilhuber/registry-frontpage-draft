abstract: "We examine the impact of replacing loans with high down payments and stringent guarantor requirements with asset-collateralized loans, similar to the mortgages and car loans that are common in developed countries. In particular, we studied a Kenyan dairy's saving and credit cooperative which randomly offered different borrowing conditions to different members for a loan for a particular asset: a 5000 liter water tank. The cooperative's standard borrowing conditions required that one third of loans be secured with deposits by the borrower, and that the remaining two thirds be secured with cash or shares from guarantors. In this study, we compare this loan contract to less stringent loan contracts to study how these requirements affect take up and loan repayments. We also conduct a number of different surveys to study the impacts of the water tanks themselves.
