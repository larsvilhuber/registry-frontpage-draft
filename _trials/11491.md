abstract: "We study how individuals negotiate their job offers. The goal of the study is twofold. First, we aim to provide a descriptive analysis of how negotiations unfold and whether there are any differences based on gender. The second part of the study is experimental, involving the cross-randomization of two treatments in the baseline survey"
