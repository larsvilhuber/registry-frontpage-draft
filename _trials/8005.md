abstract: "  Free distribution of nutritionally fortified complementary food products has been one of the popular approaches for improving infant nutrition in developing countries. In contrast, the market of baby foods is rapidly growing in developing countries nowadays, particularly in Africa. If the prevalence of those products through the market improves infant nutrition, a market-based approach will be a sustainable way to solve infantsâ€™ undernutrition.
  The free distribution can have two opposite effects on the market-based approach. The negative one is known as an anchoring effect. Free distribution discourages mothers from subsequent purchasing in the market after the end of the intervention. It is because being free makes beneficiaries feel that it is expensive to buy a product in the market. The positive one, on the other hand, is a learning effect, where mothers start purchasing or purchase more after the free distribution as they learn by the experience of using the free products. Credibility for the efficacy of the product is one of the important factors for consumer demand. The free distribution gives mothers a chance to try the product and learn its efficacy.
  Whether free distribution is promoting or discouraging the market-based approach depends on which effect is dominant. In other words, if the learning effect is large enough, short-run free distribution can contribute to the success of the market-based approach in the long run. Then we evaluate the impacts of short-run free distribution to mothers of infants on their subsequent demand for baby food.
