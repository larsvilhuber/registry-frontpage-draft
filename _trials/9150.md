abstract: "We conduct a randomized controlled trial with the general population and public sector employees to study the effect of first-hand experience of short-term incarceration on perceptions of pains of imprisonment and attitudes towards law and order. In collaboration with the Department of Justice and Home Affairs Zurich, we randomly invite interested citizens to take part in a test run of a newly built prison in Switzerland and measure their attitudes towards punishment.
