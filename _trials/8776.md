abstract: "Can intrinsically motivating employees with an organizational purpose (that transcends the usual business goals) raise employee productivity and firm profitability? We study this question through a large-scale natural field experiment with a randomized control within a large multinational financial services firm. In the experiment, we invited through a lottery 808 financial advisors (FAs) to a workshop that explains, reminds, and connects the employees to the firmâ€™s organizational higher purpose. We then compare the behavior and outcomes of invited FAs to the 14,191 in the control group, who are indistinguishable from the invited FAs based on observables. We track impulse responses using administrative data on employee financial performance, productivity, client satisfaction metrics, and surveys. Finally, we scrutinize several additional commonly invoked mechanisms through which the effect manifests, such as social preferences, motivation, clarity, identity, and external stakeholders. "
