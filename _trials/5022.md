abstract: "Several countries have sought to promote initiatives that combat discrimination in employment. This led to the rise of diversity management in the United States in the 1980s and more recently to the signing of a diversity charter followed by the promotion of a diversity label that companies can obtain if they meet certain criteria in their recruitment and human resources practices in France. These measures lead to a wide-spread implementation of so called diversity trainings that seek to directly affect the often unconscious biases of employers and HR managers in order to reduce the likelihood to discriminate in the hiring process. Some however argue that these interventions are largely ineffective, or that they even tend to activate stereotypes and increase discrimination. There has been no systematic analysis, based on a randomized trial, that would allow a scientific evaluation of these trainings. With our experimental approach we thus aim to evaluate training programs that are as representative as possible of those currently available on the market to shed light on their effectiveness regarding recruiters attitudes and behaviours.
