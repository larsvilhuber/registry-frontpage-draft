abstract: "We investigate how robots influence perceived trustworthiness in various scenarios, including hotels, restaurants, and dental clinics. Our study examines the impact of mechanical and thinking/feeling tasks performed by robots on customer perceived trustworthiness. Additionally, we assess whether enhancements in a robot's physical appearance, exemplified by the Tesla robot, and the presence of human supervision can improve perceptions of tasks rendered by robots. In this analysis plan, we pre-register the experimental framework we will follow."
