abstract: "The project randomizes, at the school level, a set of interventions to study the effectiveness of remedial mathematics teaching and certain components of the remediation. The interventions are targeted at low-performing students in mathematics as measured by standardized tests. We conduct two experiments; one in Grade 8 (at the lower secondary level) and one in Grade 11 (at the upper secondary school level). The study's hypothesis is that the target groups have important gaps and misconceptions in mathematics from their early schooling that can be remediated by the interventions, and that the students subsequently will be more likely to pass math subjects and graduate from upper secondary school. The remediation replaces 20 hours of the regular mathematics classes during the first semester and 15 hours in the second semester. Total instruction time is unchanged."
