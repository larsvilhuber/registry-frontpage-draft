abstract: "The purpose of the project is to examine whether people adjust their location decisions due to far-right mass protests. This experiment constitutes the second part of this project. In the first part, we provide some empirical evidence in favor of the hypothesis that far-right protests have a negative impact on internal migration. The purpose of the experiment is twofold. First, we want to substantiate the results of the first part of the project with experimental evidence. Second, we want to get a better understanding about how people update their views about a place if they learn about the existence of far-right protests. To reach these objectives, we use a stated-preference choice experiment. More specifically, we pose a variety of randomized location choices between two  hypothetical cities to a representative sample of Germans (aged 18 - 44). The cities are characterized by six different attributes. The presence of far-right protests is one of these attributes. In the first part of the experiment, participants are asked to decided which place they prefer as place of residence. In the second part, we ask for specific expectation, for instance with regard to security concerns and medium-run economic development.
