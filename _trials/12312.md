abstract: "There has been a rapid increase in the use of digital financial services, such as mobile money, in developing countries, particularly among the poor and marginalized who have traditionally had limited access to formal financial services.  Carrying out day-to-day financial transactions digitally has the potential for improving the financial autonomy and economic participation of poor women. We address the question whether paying the wages via mobile money affects the labour force participation and financial autonomy of low-income urban women in Bangladesh.
The study design involves a randomised intervention that provides women employed in the domestic work sector training on the use of digital financial services, as well as wage payment via mobile money. "
