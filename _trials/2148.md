abstract: "Researchers study the educational choices of immigrant students in Italy. Given increased migrant flows, educational systems have witnessed increased pressure to provide the same level of cognitive training and support for diverse student populations. A literature review indicates that immigrants tend to choose vocational over technical or academic-oriented curricula relative to native students with similar ability. Researchers estimate the impact of a randomized program that provides both career counseling and tutoring as treatment. Ultimately, results indicate that the program successful mitigates educational segregation as male treated students have a lower probability of being retained and a higher likelihood of choosing a more rigorous high school. Although the results are not significant for girls, the overall result has positive spillovers of treated immigrant students. "
