abstract: "Are list prices as cost signals effective collusion instruments?   
We develop a model where sellers in a market signal their costs. After observing the signals, one buyer choose which seller to approach, and gives that buyer a take-it or leave it offer.
Our experiment is designed to test the model's predictions."
