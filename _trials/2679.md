abstract: "We run a lab-in-the-field experiment in Ghana with female entrepreneurs and their partners, with the aim of studying efficiency and gender bias in investment allocation decisions by households. The couples play a series of voluntary contribution and modified dictator games. We introduce variations in who owns the business opportunity, whether the business opportunity is shared or private, whether communication is allowed, whether a common opportunity is framed as a traditionally "male" or traditionally "female" expense and whether participants are partnered with their spouse or a stranger.
