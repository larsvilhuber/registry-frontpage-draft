abstract: "In this project, we will randomly assign first-year university students to study groups of four students. We will conduct a baseline survey to measure student background characteristics, personality, and economic and social preferences. We will analyze how study groups should be composed in order to create social interaction and maximize learning spillovers. We will investigate which peer characteristics affect students’ performance and educational decisions."
