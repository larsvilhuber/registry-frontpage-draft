abstract: "Reducing disparities in schooling outcomes between low-income youth and their more affluent peers is a top policy priority in the United States (US). Improving schooling outcomes is central to addressing a wide range of social problems including disparities in poverty (Goldin & Katz, 2008), health outcomes (Lleras-Muney, 2005), and criminal justice involvement (Lochner & Moretti, 2004). The public education system in the US is one of the most important formal mechanisms society has for developing human potential in youth. Responsible for educating 90% of all children, the public education system has the capability to level the playing field among children of different backgrounds, starting at an early age (Hussar et al., 2018; McFarland et al., 2020). The extent to which schools can effectively achieve this aim in equity lies in their ability to cultivate and maintain a conducive learning environment that works for all students.

One promising avenue to improve educational outcomes for all students is to implement personalized learning (PL) techniques, which changes the core foundations of teaching and learning. PL refers to giving more individualized instruction to students so that they can take ownership over the pace and environment of their learning. Education researchers have understood that individualizing instruction has the potential to generate “the best learning conditions we can devise” (Bloom, 1984). This approach allows students who have different learning styles, backgrounds, and abilities to all get the level of attention they need to academically succeed. The PL approach posits that there may be a fundamental “mismatch” between what many students need – particularly those students whose backgrounds and early life experiences differ from those of majority populations – and what regular classroom environments deliver. Instead of facilitating individualized learning environments in schools, providing resources, and piloting innovative ways to systematically personalize instruction; education systems have asked teachers to instruct large classrooms of children with varied skills and needs – an approach that ignores contextual factors of students that we know are important for effective learning.

The intervention we study here – the Elevate model of PL being piloted by Chicago Public School’s (CPS) Department of Personalized Learning – attempts to comprehensively transform the learning process through a personalized approach, which is centered on technology adoption and social and emotional learning (SEL) support. Elevate is a learner-driven instructional model that fosters 21st century skills by empowering every student to actively co-design their learning path, pace, and environment according to their individual needs, strengths, and interests. In this flexible learning model, learning can happen anytime and anywhere, and students are encouraged to demonstrate their knowledge in multiple ways. 

To better understand the effects of PL as a whole-school initiative, Chicago Public School’s (CPS) launched Elevate. Elevate attempts to comprehensively transform the learning process through a personalized approach, which is centered on technology adoption and social and emotional learning (SEL) support. The program is designed to better support students in the district by providing them with the individualized instruction that they need to succeed at the school level. Elevate revolves around three main components that have been shown to be key elements of successful PL initiatives: (i) Professional Development (PD) supports to administration and teachers to prepare them with the necessary PL teaching skills and create an aligned vision with students (ii) ed-tech learning programs that have consistently shown a positive impact on instructional learning activities for students and (iii) funding for classroom redesign that has been proven to be a more positive environment for student learning (Roschelle et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2020; Hammerschmidt-Snidarich et al., 2019). In an effort to understand the implementation and impact of this significant public investment in whole-school PL, CPS Personalized Learning Department (PLD) partnered with the University of Chicago Education Lab to evaluate the Elevate model.
