abstract: "It is often suggested that religion shapes many types of social norms and preferences, and contributes to the persistence of conservative values. In terms of gender, it may contribute to lower willingness of women to be the leaders. In this project, we will study the impact of religion on choices of the participants to what extent they want to take the lead. We will elicit measures of willingness to lead among a sample of members of 250 Christian churches in Western Kenya. We will experimentally manipulate whether the choices are made in private or may be observed by somebody else (participant’s religious leader or participant’s co-villager). In addition, we will elicit views about appropriateness of willingness to take the lead among the religious leaders from the same 250 churches. "
