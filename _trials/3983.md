abstract: "This study adds to the understanding of time preferences in situations where inter-temporal trade-offs extend beyond typical two-period scenario. In addition to the typical choice between smaller-sooner vs. later-larger amount in a two-period setting, a CTB approach, which strongly relies on the separability and additivity assumptions, our design investigates how people make trade-offs in a three-period elicitation task. In this richer environment, participants can possibly apply different discount rates to sooner vs later delays (e.g. declining discounting), or prefer to smooth the payments over multiple periods and violate separability.
