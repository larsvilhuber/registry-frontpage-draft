abstract: "Rapidly increasing college tuition affects studentsâ€™ college choice decisions, deterring enrollment at selective options. In this project, we aim to examine the role of behavioral interventions in influencing college cost information on university enrollment decisions among disadvantaged students, particularly in the context of a tuition fee increasing policy. Among a sample of Chinese low-income college applicants in 2023 who faced college tuition increases, we randomly assigned students to control or treatment groups with information on (a) the national tuition increase policy, (b) the national tuition increase policy and financial aid policy, or (c) the national tuition increase policy and benefits of enrolling in major cities. Using survey and administrative data, we offer novel insights on nudges to enhance low-income students' college access and success worldwide."
