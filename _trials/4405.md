abstract: "This study follows a randomized evaluation of a program to promote the production of pulses in Bihar, India. Farmers in treatment villages were given the opportunity to buy pulse seeds and other inputs at discounted rates, coupled with training and extension services to promote better cropping practices. All implementation was conducted by local development NGOs that have been operating in the area for several years. A key measure of the sustainability of the program is the demand for purchasing and planting pulse seeds once subsidies are no longer in place. We elicit this demand through conducting seed auctions in all treatment and control villages. During demand elicitation, we randomize the salience of the evaluation itself by emphasizing that we are collecting data to evaluate the local partner's performance in promoting pulse production in half the villages. By using this two-level randomization, we seek to assess how the salience of an evaluation affects the measured treatment effects of a development program. "
