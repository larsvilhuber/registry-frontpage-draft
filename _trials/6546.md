abstract: "Social information programs are widely used by policy makers to nudge behavioural change. Our first research question looks at the direct impact of a customized household report about water usage on water consumption in Italy. Our second research question relates to the spillover effects of the water report on the individual consumption of other resources, such as gas and electricity. The third research question is to assess the effect of receiving different nudges. In our case, people receive different social information on different resources."
