abstract: "Addressing institutional service-delivery related to gender-based violence is a major pol-
icy challenge. Despite its policy relevance, there exists considerable gaps in the literature
as to how to address the issue. In this project we aim to address these gaps by focusing
on the role policing quality may play in addressing GBV. We conducted a randomized
control trial (RCT) in Bihar, India, to study the causal effect of a novel intervention that
uses expressive arts pedagogy for police officers on technical and soft skills, norms and
behaviors regarding GBV. For our study, we randomly assigned 419 police stations (PS)
across 12 districts in the state to either receiving the training or a control group. Senior
officers operating in treated stations are invited to attend the training. We test the effect of
the intervention on new measures that aim to better understand how better interactions
between citizens and officers may improve GBV survivorsâ€™ outcomes. We develop new
tools to measure victim blaming, empathy and knowledge of GBV-specific laws among
others. We also measure the effects of the intervention on different types of women inter-
acting with officers, and through a decoy experiment.
