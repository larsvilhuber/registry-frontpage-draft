abstract: "This is phase two of a project (first phase Title: Does work effort for public versus private organizations differ? Evidence from an online work task experiment RCT ID AEARCTR-0003361).

The overall set of questions of the first and second phase of the project are about whether and how public and private sector organizations differ from each other and the effects of these differences. An important part of this interest are effects on those working for these organizations. Do workers perceive public organizations as different in characteristics, including their goals, than otherwise similar private, for-profit organizations and what are the consequences? We take as a starting point the issue of whether ownership cues that convey information about the organization's ownership status affect people’s perception of organizations and the way they work for them. We conduct an experiment recruiting online workers via Amazon’s crowdsourcing platform Mechanical Turk to address these questions using random allocation of interventions.

The second phase of the project conducts an experiment with the same work task to the first phase, but with an addition intervention prior to this task of providing participants with a treatment reinforcing the information given to them about the ownership (public versus private, for-profit) of the hypothetical organization they are asked to work for. This treatment is hypothesized to increase the salience of the public versus private status difference of the organization by making participants more aware of the organization they are working for, reducing mistakes in the public condition (for more details please see following sections).
