abstract: "In this paper, we (1) utilize a randomized control trial (RCT) to estimate the impact of a learning community on first year college retention; (2) introduce simple tests for the external validity of RCT results, and apply these tests to our data; and (3) compare observational estimates to those from the RCT, considering the internal and external validity of both approaches. Intent-to-treat and local average treatment estimates reveal no discernable programmatic effects, whereas observational estimates are significantly positive. The experimental sample, though negatively selected on observed characteristics, is positively selected on unobserved characteristics implying limited external validity of the RCT.   "
