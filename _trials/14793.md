abstract: "In an increasingly hectic and stressful world, small acts of kindness are often rare, but they could impact people’s behavior in positive ways that extend far beyond the immediate moment.
This study will explore whether the kindness of cashiers can indirectly influence customers’ donation behavior at the checkout. Over a period of two weeks, customers will be observed at two identical checkout counters at a supermarket, differing only in the cashier’s demeanor—one being friendly and engaging, while the others remain neutral. 
By comparing the increase in donation rates at each checkout between periods, we aim to investigate if a cashier’s kindness can encourage customers to act prosocial, even though it is unrelated to their immediate interaction.
