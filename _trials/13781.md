abstract: "Adaptation is required to cope with climate change. Theory predicts that agricultural
insurance, which protects farmers against climate damages, and enjoys billions of sub-
sidy dollars, may either increase or decrease private adaptation. Subsidized insurance
may crowd in adaptation by limiting farmersâ€™ risks from experimenting with new tech-
nologies. However, it may instead crowd out adaptation, by insulating farmers against
climate risk. We test which of these effects dominates with an RCT in West Bengal,
India. We randomize 300 villages into a control group and index insurance arms, where
farmers receive payouts if floods occur. We estimate the impact of insurance on farmer
willingness-to-pay for both flood-tolerant and high-yield-variety seeds, providing a di-
rect test of the impacts of insurance on demand for adaptation. We also induce random
variation in seed take-up, in order to estimate the effects of specialty seeds, insurance,
and their interaction on agricultural inputs and ex post welfare outcomes"
