abstract: "This study explores the spillover effects of an environmental education program on non-participants, particularly focusing on the bi-directional transmission of pro-environmental behaviors between children and parents. Through a randomized experiment with 1,545 child-parent pairs in Patna, India, we examine how participation in the program affects environmental knowledge, efficacy, and behaviors. Our design divides student-parent pairs into control, child-only, parent-only, and child+parent participation groups, allowing us to analyze both the direct impact of participating in the program and its indirect spillovers within families."
