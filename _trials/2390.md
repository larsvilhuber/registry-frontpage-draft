abstract: "	We present the design and pre-analysis plan for a randomized control trial evaluating the effects of randomized audit threats and moral appeals on tax compliance of small and medium sized firms in Bulgaria. True audit probabilities are randomly varied between treatments and communicated to the firms. In addition, we employ treatments in which firms receive mailings highlighting the importance of taxes and specifying the purpose of tax money. Similar to the treatments with varying audit probabilities, we also manipulate the strength of the moral appeals to taxpayers. We benchmark our findings in the different treatments against a control group which receives a neutral mail from the tax authorities."
