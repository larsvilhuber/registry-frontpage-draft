abstract: "We study the role of preferences, incentives and information for socially responsible investments (SRI) in an online experiment. We analyze which investors buy sustainable stocks, to what extent they are willing to pay for information about the sustainability of stocks and how investors react to information about the performance of sustainable stocks. Finally, we analyze the effect of endogenous information acquisition in the ESG context in combination with different incentives to invest in a portfolio with a low ESG risk rating. To address these questions, we implement an incentive compatible stock market game with approximately 660 students. All participants are introduced to different information and incentive treatments. Furthermore, we experimentally elicit risk preferences, altruism, and warm glow giving and combine these measures with survey evidence."
