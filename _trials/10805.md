abstract: "Africa is the most rapidly urbanizing continent on earth. Yet, how rapid urbanization is transforming the structures of power and accountability in rural villages remains poorly understood. This project seeks to provide causal evidence about the impacts of access to cities in Africa on the political economy of rural villages. We study the randomized rollout of a program promoting urban access in rural villages in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Implemented by a local NGO called Congo Helping Hands (CHH), this `City Access Program' (CAP) provides regular weekly transportation by motorbike taxi to the city of Kananga to individuals living in rural villages surrounding the city. Our project studies the effects of CHH's programs on the leadership of village chiefs and citizens' efforts to hold them to account. "
