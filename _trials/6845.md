abstract: "In light of the persistence of gender gaps in labor market outcomes, policy measures have been implemented to encourage women to enter highly competitive, male-stereotypical and well-paid jobs. However, there is reason to believe that women experience backlash from entering such male domains and from ``acting male''.  In this research project we investigate whether neutral spectators put women at a disadvantage in a male-stereotypical domain when income inequalities arise and competition is voluntary."
