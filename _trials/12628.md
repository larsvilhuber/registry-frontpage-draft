abstract: "Public procurement plays an important role in the economy, serving as a significant source of demand for various industries. However, the effectiveness of procurement tenders depends on the participation of the right firms. There is not much existing research focusing on the views and preferences of employees from companies considering participation in these tenders. This study aims to address this gap.

To explore this question, a conjoint survey experiment is conducted among employees of firms potentially engaging in public procurement tenders in Finland. Respondents are asked to make choices between fictional procurement tender profiles, each characterized by several attributes, randomized by the researchers.

These attributes include experience with similar tenders, the project's scale relative to the company's turnover, the nature of the procurement organization, secondary objectives related to the product or provider, criteria for selecting the winning bid, the time invested in preparing and filing the offer, the estimated likelihood of competitors raising complaints with the market court, and the expected level of competition.
The research studies the impact of these attributes on the decision to participate in procurement tenders and assesses the relative importance of each attribute in the decision-making process. Furthermore, the study examines whether the previous experience and the product portfolio of firms play a role. A dedicated section of the research also addresses the price and participation effects of secondary objectives in procurement tenders.
