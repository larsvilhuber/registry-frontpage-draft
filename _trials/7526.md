abstract: "Recently the US-China technology competition and decoupling has been accelerating and has contributed to the rise of nationalistic sentiment and geopolitical tension. One key dimension that has been fueling the US-China tech competition is the issue surrounding data privacy and security. This study examines how the technology competition between the US and China invokes nationalistic sentiments and affect peopleâ€™s perception on data privacy and surveillance in China.
