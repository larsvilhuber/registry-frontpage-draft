abstract: "Generative AI economic benefits in aggregate are often cited. However, the productivity or efficiency improvements within organisations is an emerging topic.  Recent research focused on knowledge work suggest productivity or efficiency improvements may be large, finding significant effects for certain types of tasks, with more benefits to less experienced workers.  Evaluating the value/benefits and costs of GenAI in knowledge-driven organisations within a public sector may not be as clear-cut in a for-profit context. To provide some evidence, our study will test the impact of GenAI on two knowledge-work tasks among staff in the organisation."
