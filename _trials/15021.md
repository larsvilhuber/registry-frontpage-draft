abstract: "The study uses a cluster-randomized controlled trial to investigate the impact of community-based life skills training delivered in safe spaces for adolescent girls on sexual and reproductive health and empowerment outcomes. The effect of safe spaces for girls is compared to the joint provision of said safe spaces with clubs to engage boys and men in the community."
