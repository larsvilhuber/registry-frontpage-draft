abstract: "We seek to establish how feedback can be customized to optimize performance. We will extend knowledge on this topic by using a field experiment in a competitive sport setting (a commercial training simulator used by elite football clubs) to scientifically establish the types of feedback that work best on average and for players of different profiles. Specifically, we will test the performance effects of relative performance feedback (absolute vs relative vs absolute and relative) and feedback detail (high-level vs detailed). We will do so by randomly assigning different types of feedback to the players (high-level and absolute, high-level and relative, high-level and both absolute and relative, detailed and absolute, detailed and relative, detailed and both absolute and relative)."
