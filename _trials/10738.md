abstract: "How do tax payers react to progressive tax reforms? Does a progressive tax reform affect tax compliance? We study this issue in the context of a large municipality in the outskirts of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The local government implemented a progressive tax reform in the local property tax, with reductions in the tax rate for properties with the lowest values and increases for those with the highest values. We partnered with the municipality to target the universe of around 100.000 taxpayers with letters outlining the reform and whether the recipient's tax rate was reduced, increased or stayed the same because of her property's valuation. The key aspect of our mailing campaign was the salience of the progressive tax reform: while the baseline letter only stated whether the receipient's tax rate had changed, the treatment letter provided details about the progressive nature of the reform. We will analyze the impact of the reform's details on tax compliance, payments and views for the three groups separately (i.e., for those with low property valuations and tax reductions, for those with mid-value valuations and no changes, and for those with high property valuations and tax increases).
