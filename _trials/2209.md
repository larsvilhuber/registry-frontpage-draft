abstract: "The Deferred GST scheme allows businesses to defer the payment of GST on taxable imports which is beneficial for their cash flows. In order to remain on the scheme businesses must continue to meet all of their tax obligations. This includes lodging a monthly activity statement and being up to date on any payments due to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). At any given time, a proportion of businesses on the scheme are non-compliant. Addressing this non-compliance creates additional work for the ATO and leads to higher levels of outstanding tax debt.  

This trial will test the effectiveness of a planning prompt email sent to new businesses registering with the scheme reminding them that they will need to stay up to date with their tax obligations each month.  A successful intervention could increase business compliance and bring forward business tax payments.
