abstract: "This study evaluates the impact of a Home-Grown School Feeding Programme in Malawi, targeting 400,000 primary and pre-primary students across 416 schools and 120 Early Childhood Development (ECD) centers. Using a randomized controlled trial, we assess the programme's causal effects on nutritional and educational outcomes of preschool and primary school students, as well as household welfare and willingness to pay for public services. The evaluation explores pathways linking school meals to learning improvements, nutritional catch-up, and enhanced household resilience to shocks. Learning and anthropometric data will be collected on 4800 children attending 200 treatment and 200 control primary schools and 1560 children between the ages of 3-5 in the catchment areas of 78 treatment and 78 control ECD centers. Additionally, household survey data will be collected from the households of all sample children, numbering 6360 in total. Additional data will be gathered through school attendance and headteacher surveys. Results will inform policy by providing evidence on the multi-sectoral benefits of school feeding programs, addressing gaps in existing literature, and guiding future investment decisions in education and social protection."
