abstract: "Availability heuristics and gambler's fallacy affect considerably the decision-making of individuals, which is particularly true regarding financial decisions. Those two heuristics are seen to affect the probability weighting (and sometimes also its estimation) of an event/information by its frequency or on how easy it comes to mind. Although those heuristics are usually analysed in comparison to the expected utility theory, this paper analyses them using the prospect theory. More specifically, it analyses if different degrees of availability heuristics and gambler's fallacy are more or less affected by the possibility effect (i.e. overweight of small probabilities just seen as "possible" in contrast to "impossible"). Moreover, this paper analysis a causal link of financial education treatments mitigating those heuristics and a possible spill over to the possibility effect using a randomized controlled trial with Belgian secondary schools.
