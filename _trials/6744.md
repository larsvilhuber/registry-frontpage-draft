abstract: "Crowdsourcing has become more popular in recent years. However, not much is known about how to motivate crowdworkers except for the use of monetary incentives. This becomes even more important when they are conducting tasks that require high engagement but for which the objective quality is difficult to assess. Such tasks might include video, picture, or text classifications and ratings. Per piece payments may increase the speed but actually reduce the quality. In an online experiment, we study the use of (performance unrelated) recognition and positive versus negative framing regarding (performance-based) payment. We use different (more or less objective) performance measures as well as measures of (objective and subjective) crowdworkers’ motivation and (subjective) job satisfaction."
