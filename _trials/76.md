abstract: "Yalla Watheefa (Let's Get a Job) is a pilot program designed to help connect youth to job opportunities, and to measure the willingness of youth to apply for different types of jobs. The program works with around 2000 university and community college graduates in Jordan, and attempts to link them to job openings in a wide range of occupations. A random sample of graduates will be linked to each job opening, and the project will measure whether these graduates are willing to apply for different jobs, their performance in job interviews, and whether this process of facilitating matching of youth to open jobs is able to increase their employment."
