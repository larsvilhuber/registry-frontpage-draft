abstract: "Undernutrition remains a major health problem in many settings. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess whether the provision of growth charts and food supplements can improve child growth. Households with young children were randomly selected to receive either (1) nutritional supplements alone, (2) growth charts alone or (3) supplements alongside regular monitoring through growth charts. After 18 months of intervention, WTP for continued access to food supplements was measured through home visits offering supplements at randomly determined prices. "
