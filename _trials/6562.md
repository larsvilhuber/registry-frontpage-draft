abstract: "In a laboratory experiment we investigate the role of sexual objectification in media on economic decision-making. In the experiment subjects are asked to evaluate advertisements from womenâ€™s magazines. In the treatment groups these images are sexually objectifying, while they are neutral in the control group. The primary hypothesis is that sexual objectifying makes women self-objectifying and as a result their perceived power in economic decision-making context will be weaker. We will measure this through a required minimum compensation to participate in an additional study following directly after the experiment."
