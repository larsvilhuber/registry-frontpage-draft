abstract: "The objective of this trial is to investigate the endurance effect of interventions on small businesses' tax compliance in Indonesia. Specifically, this study attempts to address whether there are sustainable effects rather than immediate effects following an intervention. We explore whether taxpayers will learn from previous treatments, or if regular communication is necessary to maintain long-term effects and sustainability. In doing so, we replicate and resend the identical treatment letters (i.e., deterrence, literacy, and public goods provision letters) one year after our initial interventions. The target group for this study comprises around 5,600 small taxpayers. The treatment groups will be contrasted with a control group comprising individuals who did not receive any letters. The target populations were randomly divided into four equal groups, with each group consisting of around 1,400 observations."
