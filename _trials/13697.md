abstract: "This study aims to test an extension of the reference dependence theory of Köszegi and Rabin (AER, 2007) to a social domain. In an online experiment, we create a situation where two people have worked under provided expectations of a bonus payment: With 45% probability, bonuses will be (a,b), with 45% probability bonuses will be (c,d), and with 10% probability something else will happen, and a decision will be made by either a one of the two worker participants (a "stakeholder") or a third party (a "spectator"). A treatment difference in this decision will be informative on the existence of reference dependence. "
