abstract: "This study aims at incentivizing secondary school attendance in Bangladesh. We conduct a randomized control trial (RCT) that would entail giving conditional cash transfers (CCT) using a loss aversion design. The design seeks to exploit the widely observed psychological trait that people tend to more strongly avert losses than the reduction of the same amount of gains. The main research question is whether CCT may have a larger impact on school attendance when combined with a loss aversion design. Given the high costs involved in CCT programs, a higher impact design may help further promote the policy goal of encouraging school attendance while keeping costs contained.
