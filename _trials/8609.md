abstract: "While the existence of discrimination has long been established, little is known about the actual sources of discrimination. Researchers typically categorize discrimination as either taste-based or belief-based discrimination based on either accurate or inaccurate beliefs. While any kind of discrimination can have fatal consequences for the discriminated, a precise identification of the source of discrimination has important implications for effective policy interventions. I suggest a careful analysis of the information acquisition and processing stage that precedes potentially discriminatory decisions. In particular, imitating a hiring decision in an online experiment, I analyze the effect of biased information acquisition and processing on discriminatory behavior and investigate whether people selectively attend and adhere to different kinds of information."
