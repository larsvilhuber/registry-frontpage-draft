abstract: "We implement a field experiment to identify biased beliefs among cigarette smokers regarding the smoking cessation decision.  Participants are offered incentives to refrain from smoking on a weekly basis.  Smoking status is biochemically verified using cotinine saliva tests.  Participants are asked also asked to predict their response to such incentives, as well as to value incentives for refraining from smoking on future dates.  "
