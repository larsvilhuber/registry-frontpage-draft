abstract: "A field experiment seeking to improve the waste sorting among urban households living in apartment buildings in the municipality of Copenhagen. The study will focus on bio waste and use general waste as an indicator of the general level of waste sorting. 
The field experiment takes place over a 9-week period within 5 yards, covering around 900 households. 
A treatment group will receive a postcard with information regarding the positive effects of waste sorting (information-based instruments) as well as a sticker reminding the subjects to sort their waste (implementation intentions). In the treatment yards, stickers will be placed on all bio and general waste bins, providing feedback to the households of the current sorting levels compared to the average of the neighbourhood using both descriptive and injunctive messages (social norms). These stickers will be updated with new numbers three weeks after the first implementation. A control group will only be observed.
We expect to observe an increase in the amount of bio waste sorted as well as a decrease in the level of general waste, as treated households engage in waste sorting of not only bio waste but other fractions as well, i.e. plastic, metal, paper etc.. The control group is expected to have a relatively constant level of waste sorting.  "
