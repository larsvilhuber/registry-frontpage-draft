abstract: "In this project we will design, implement and evaluate e-messaging modules of different lengths aimed at families with children between the ages of 0 and 3 at the onset of the program. The program will be built on top of a 16-week tele-assistance intervention that will be implemented by a government agency in Uruguay.

The phone calls will provide families with advice and guidance on parenting practices, health and nutrition, and will articulate the different local resources that families have access to. This will be combined with three non-consecutive e-messaging modules with: (i) information on positive parenting topics covered in the phone calls, (ii) suggestions for activities to be carried out at home, (iii) motivation, and (iv) feedback on performance. The content of the messages seeks to mitigate suboptimal decisions caused by present bias, parental role complexity, cognitive fatigue, and the influence of negative identities.

The results of this project will generate a better understanding of the ability of a program that combines phone calls and e-messages to sustain behaviors and habits over time and will allow the design of more effective and cost-efficient programs, both in the area of parenting and in other behavioral areas (health, nutrition, education)."
