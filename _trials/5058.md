abstract: "This proposed study will: 1) extend a longitudinal dataset of students who were participants in a randomized literacy intervention during grades 1-4, as they transition out of primary school and into their adolescence years; 2) measure the effects of foundational literacy skills in primary school – due to the intervention – on primary school completion, secondary school enrollment, and learning outcomes (also measure labor market participation, aspirations, motivation, and other measures of well-being); 3) compare the differential effects of two versions of delivery of the literacy program (a full-cost version and a lower-cost version) to estimate the differences in cost- effectiveness; and 4) compare two levels of exposure to the program (one year vs. four years) to estimate the differences in cost-effectiveness. The project will follow 2,674 students in two cohorts to grades 6/7."
