abstract: "There are concerns regarding the sustainability of social enterprises that aim to achieve both financial and social objectives. This is due to the additional cost required to tackle social problems. The Social Progress Credit (SPC) program is an initiative designed to support social enterprises by providing cash incentives proportionate to their social performance. Given that the pursuit of social performance may come at the expense of financial performance, we conduct a nine-year RCT (2020-2028) to investigate the impact of the SPC program both on the financial and social performances of social enterprises. Our preliminary results suggest that social performance-based incentives can improve social performance without compromising the financial sustainability of social enterprises."
