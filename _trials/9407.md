abstract: "People who have received help may be more likely to pay it forward by helping a third party. We use a lab experiment to investigate psychological motivations behind this behavior. We extend the psychological game-theoretic model of Dufwenberg & Kirchsteiger (2004) to guide our experimental investigation. Our experiment suggests that altruism and indirect reciprocity are the main reasons that people pay kindness forward. Equity can also play a role, but credit -- the degree that beneficiaries appreciate kindness -- does not. Our experiment and theory improve our understanding of how kind behavior gets passed on among parties that never directly interact, which has implications for the formation of social norms and atmosphere in workplaces, neighborhoods, and communities.
