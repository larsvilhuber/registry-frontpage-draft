abstract: "The goal of this study is to investigate which factors determine public support for digital governance solutions and if exposure to information about the potential abuse of these tools by the government might affect this support. We hypothesize that, in line with previous findings, institutional gaps and asymmetric information positively predict support for a digital governance tool, while exposure to information about the potential abuse might have a negative effect. We expect this negative effect to be moderated by the existence of institutional gaps and sources of information. We test our predictions with the help of a survey experiment of 2400 respondents in the Russian Federation. 
Previous research suggests that where institutions are weak, support for new institutions overcoming said weaknesses is high. Where information is controlled by the government in the form of censorship or propaganda by either state-owned or state-controlled media, the public may be misinformed about the potential abuse of such new institutions. Thus, we expect that citizens who receive information primarily through national media will show higher support for the digital governance tool. We further control for government satisfaction, trust in the government, previous contact with digital governance, and the usual range of socio-demographic indicators. "
