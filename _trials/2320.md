abstract: "Young children in the developing world often maintain an unhealthy diet with very low dietary diversity, which increases the risk of not only stunting and wasting but also chronic diseases. This research project aims to identify the major barriers to improved complementary feeding and ways to address them in a developing country setting. Formative research suggests information, affordability, accessibility, gender, and peers to be the major constraints. Under this hypothesis, the study will employ clustered randomized experiment in the context of Ethiopia to examine the effects of nutrition behavior change communication (BCC), food vouchers, gender education, and peers on child feeding behaviors and child growth.
