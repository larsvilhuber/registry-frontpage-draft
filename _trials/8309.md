abstract: "The Trial aims at developing a RCT to compare the socio-economic impact produced in the SMEs that choose to innovate based on a previously identified challenges with economic support against those that innovate based on a previously identified challenges  with economic support and guided by the tutelage of  (co-creation) and supported by INFO with “go to market” services. The main goal is to analyse the performance and the advantages and constraints for INFO of one or the other model.
Additionally, other interesting issues can be addressed in the RCT:
•Commitment to business digitisation to get out of the Covid19 crisis 
•To satisfy technological needs of large-tractor companies located in the Region of Murcia   through the competition of SMEs acting as providers of technological solutions. (such a target of companies being traditionally excluded for ERDF intervention in the Murcia region)
The main outcome of the project will be provided at the end of the project, with the analysis of the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that will permit the comparison between the SMEs following the both technical arms defined in the project (i.e.  Co-creation and business support) or without these added value services. 
All the SMEs involved in the project, belonging to control arm or intervention arm will receive the same funding rate to carry out their projects and the same challenge fiche. The only difference will be the added value services that will join the intervention group companies according to the inDemand model (ie. co-creation + business support). 
It is a Controlled Randomized Clinical Trial, stratified, non blinded, unicentric and with two parallel branches to study, based on the innovation support model (inDemand Model with co-creation and business support versus inDemand Model without additional support).
