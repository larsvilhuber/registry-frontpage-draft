abstract: "This study partnered with the Ethiopian MFI Wasasa to test the impact of granting relatively large, uncollateralized loans to women business owners after screening via a psychometric loan appraisal technology. Potential borrowers were required to present themselves at the MFI's branches to apply for the loan and take the psychometric test. If a woman passed the test cut-off score, she was deemed eligible for the loan, and was randomised with 50-50 probability into the treatment or control group. All eligible women were subsequently required to provide documentation and pass a business appraisal; then their treatment status was revealed, and women who had been assigned to treatment and who had also met the documentation and business appraisal requirements were granted a loan. We analyse the impact of the loan using baseline data collected at the time a potential borrower presented herself at the branch between April 2018 and March 2020, and endline data from a face-to-face follow-up survey in September 2021. A short midline phone survey was also conducted with part of the sample in May 2020, to assess immediate impacts of COVID."
