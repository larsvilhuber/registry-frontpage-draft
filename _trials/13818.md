abstract: "Horticultural crops such as mangoes, avocados, and citrus are playing a crucial role to sub-Saharan African economies, supporting the livelihoods millions of farmers. Nevertheless, these crops face various challenges stemming from pests, diseases, and the impacts of climate change. Among the primary threats are fruit flies and white mango scale, causing significant economic losses. The uptake of Integrated Pest and Pollination Management (IPPM) presents a promising strategy to prevent crop damages caused by pests and diseases, ultimately leading to increased yields and income, while simultaneously reducing the dependency on uses of harmful agrochemicals like pesticides. Yet, the adoption of IPPM remains low due to insufficient extension services, resulting in poor knowledge and skills, limited access to IPPM resources, and inadequate economic incentives to foster adoption. Using a clustered randomized controlled trial (RCT), this research project evaluates the impact of three scaling strategies of IPPM. The interventions are Mango Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Training, Mango Integrated Pest and Pollination Management (IPPM) training and beehive distribution to farmers to place in their mango orchards, and Mango Integrated Pest and Pollination Management with Digital Extension (IPPM-DE). The study will evaluate the impacts of the interventions on IPPM adoption, mango yield, and income using data from 96 villages (944 mango farmers) in South Ethiopia Regional State. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be utilized to estimate the impact of the interventions. "
