abstract: "Despite repeated efforts both on the supply side (improving facility equipment and supplies, and financial incentives to providers) and on the demand side (communication campaign including mass-media outreach), screening rates for diabetes and hypertension are still lagging in the Armenian population. Hypertension and diabetes are among the top drivers of preventable death and disability due to non-communicable diseases in Armenia. The focus of this evaluation will be on increasing screening rates for diabetes and hypertension for males and females ages 35-68. Current screening rates are: diabetes mellitus, females 48.1%, males 30.9%; hypertension, females 75.4%; males 48.3%.

We will evaluate different types of demand-side incentives to increase the take-up of the screenings. We will compare regular incentives for patients to come for screenings, including personal invitations, personal invitations mentioning that peers have tested, a labeled but unconditional cash transfer (in the form of “cash like” pharmacy voucher) and a conditional cash transfer, also in the form of a pharmacy voucher."
