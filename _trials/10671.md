abstract: "Although female workforce participation has increased in the last decades, coding remains a male-dominated field. We have partnered with a coding course provider that is interested in increasing female enrollment and persistence throughout their selection process. One stage of the selection process, in particular, generates a significant gender imbalance: the need to play online logic and memory games. We designed a nudge experiment to try to enhance female take up of these games and their persistence through the selection process. The experiment will test whether providing information about female participation and performance in the previous selection process stimulates other women to persist in the process. Moreover, we would like to understand what are the potential barriers that discourage women to persist through the selection process and which are the mechanisms that can explain the effect (or lack of effect) of our proposed treatment. Thus, survey questions addressing beliefs will be inserted in the selection process. The results might shed light into how stereotypes and beliefs influence women's decision to enter and persist in male-dominated environments."
