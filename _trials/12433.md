abstract: "We study the link between perceived tail risks and decisions in a large sample of representative households. This study extends a previous RCT registered under the ID AEARCTR-0009917 (results available at https://www.johannes-beutel.com). In this new RCT we are particularly interested in the role of tail beliefs for decisions. More precisely, we investigate the link between the perceived risk of various tail events vis-a-vis portfolio allocations and consumption decisions. "
