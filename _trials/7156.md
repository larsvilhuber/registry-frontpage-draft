abstract: "This randomized control trial will determine whether financial incentives can be used to encourage caregivers to participate in online training programs. We will partner with Helping Restore Ability (HRA), a non-profit that supports thousands of caregivers in Texas, as they roll out a new online training program to improve in-home care quality. To encourage training take-up, treated individuals will receive emails offering a financial incentive for completing an online training program. Members of the control group will receive a standard email with no incentive for training completion. This study will determine the impact of this financial incentive on participation and performance in the training program."
