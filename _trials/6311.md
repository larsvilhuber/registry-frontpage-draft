abstract: "A significant challenge in child welfare is allocating child maltreatment investigations to families. Each year, 8 million children in the U.S. are referred to child protective services and fewer than half receive an investigation. Caseworkers typically have fewer than 15 minutes decide whether or not to investigate a case using information from the current referral and the child's past history. A potential solution to this friction is an algorithmic decision aide using past history to provide a summary statistic of a child's risk.

The goal of the project is to evaluate the effect of an algorithm-based decision tool on caseworker decision-making and child outcomes. Our project will leverage variation in tool features to understand why and how information changes the way experts make decisions, and what types of information helps to improve the quality of decisions. In particular, risk scores (quantitative) and risk features (qualitative) will be randomly revealed for certain cases within each decision-making team. The project has implications for improving the effectiveness of human-algorithm interaction.
