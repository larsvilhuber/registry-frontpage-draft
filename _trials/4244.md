abstract: "We use a laboratory experiment to investigate whether men and women receive different work advice in a setting where the quality of the advisee is ambiguous. At a later stage, we also aim to test whether a potential gender difference in advice is removed when advisors are provided with more objective indicators of the advisee's performance, and when they are not made aware of the advisee's gender."
