abstract: "This study draws from the approach of Karlan et al. (2011), using an algorithm (a computer program) to seek out a group of "marginal reject lenders" among customers applying for digital finance for the first time. Subsequently, a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) is conducted on this group of "Marginal Reject Lenders", randomly approving digital finance applications to assess the marginal effect of digital finance.

The reason for focusing on "marginal reject lenders" is that directly carrying out an RCT targeting all loan applicants would be costly. Moreover, the RCT may reject some applicants who could have been approved in regular business procedures, thus harming the welfare of these applicants.

To address this, this study aims to find among those rejected by normal business rules, a group of loan applicants who exhibit similar characteristics, have comparable credit qualifications, but due to minor issues, fall slightly below the loan approval threshold (the "marginal reject lenders" group). By implementing an additional randomized digital finance approval intervention (either approval or continued rejection), we form corresponding digital finance treatment and control groups. By comparing the relative changes in welfare performance indicators between the two groups, we attribute these changes to the marginal contribution of digital finance."
