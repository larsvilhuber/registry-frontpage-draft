abstract: "A new civic education curriculum is being implemented in public primary schools in Liberia by the country’s Ministry of Education (MoE) and  local implementing partners (IPs). The civic education intervention—which includes teachers receiving textbooks, teacher guides, and training on the new civic education curriculum and students receiving textbooks and classroom instruction—will last five years and aims to ultimately reach 10 percent of Liberian primary school students. This program is being piloted in 70 public primary schools in the 2023–2024 school year in three counties: Grand Bassa, Montserrado, and Nimba. We are conducting an impact evaluation (IE) through a randomized controlled trial to understand the program’s impacts on students’ civic outcomes. We randomly assigned 140 schools - 70 to receive the civic education program and 70 to serve as control schools that do not receive the program. The evaluation aims to inform further scale-up of the program in Liberia. The review of existing literature also demonstrates the wider need to better understand the impact of civic education in low-income emerging democracies and post-conflict settings, especially at the primary school level."
