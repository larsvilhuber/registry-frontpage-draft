abstract: "Africa has both the worldâ€™s youngest population and some of the highest rates of youth unemployment globally. While a growing literature links gender and ethnic bias to inefficient economic outcomes across a range of contexts in Africa, there is limited understanding of their contribution to frictions in labor markets. Using new administrative data on 227,194 applicants and over 2 million matches from an online job platform in Nigeria, we study matching and the role of gender and ethnicity in firm hiring. We find significant differences in the matching behavior of applicants by gender. Women tend to be more qualified, by education, for the jobs they apply to than men, but less qualified, by years of experience. Women apply to lower numbers of jobs and more lower level jobs than men, even when qualified for the position. Women are also less likely to be hired for a position than similarly qualified male applicants. 

Why do we observe these gender gaps in application and hiring? And can low cost information interventions help reduce gender gaps in applications and hiring in online labor markets? To answer these questions, we implement a randomized control trial (RCT) to examine the effects of low cost information interventions on the observed gender gaps in application and hiring in the online labor market."
