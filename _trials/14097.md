abstract: "In a low-trust society, collective decision-making is not easy. Driven by the statement that Central European inhabitants can be even ready to bear the costs of disengagement, we assess the housing preferences of various multi-family building residents in Poland and Czechia using a discrete choice experiment. This method is widely used to study willingness to pay for specific goods or services. In this specific study, it will assess preferences regarding renovation investments by multi-family building residents. Our survey, which includes a vignette experiment, will primarily focus on social and institutional attributes, potentially important but less studied within the context of enabling green investments and energy transition. Specifically, we set the investments with various beneficiaries, personal engagement, democratic procedures as well as short- and long-term individual accounts. The same survey will be conducted both online (CAWI) and in the field (CAPI) in Poland and Czechia during the same time. The online survey (CAWI) will cover a sample of 6,000 residents of multi-family buildings in Poland and Czechia. The field survey (CAPI) will cover a sample of 1,050 residents from three purposefully selected multi-family units [housing cooperatives]: two in Poland and one in Czechia. The results of the study will contribute to understanding the conditions of success and failure of developing green investments in multi-family housing in various country, ownership, and community contexts."
