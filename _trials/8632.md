abstract: "In many developing countries the large-scale expansion of agricultural producers involves the acquisition of vast areas of land from traditional rural communities. While some of the land purchases happen voluntarily and in good faith, other transactions are forced and occur against the will of local communities. In this research project we examine the consequences of large-scale land acquisitions on local villagers’ welfare in Central Indonesia – the island of Borneo. The research project involves two related but separate studies. Study 1 will investigate the impact of land acquisitions on local villager’s mental health. Study 2 will analyze the role of land acquisitions on interethnic trust and reciprocity.   "
