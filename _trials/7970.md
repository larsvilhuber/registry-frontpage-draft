abstract: "Across the energy market consumers experience confusion reading and understanding their energy bills. The current rules for what is required in energy bills are almost a decade old, and fail to reflect the changes to the market that have occurred during this period. We are aiming to inform the development of new rules for energy bills, designed to improve customer understanding."
