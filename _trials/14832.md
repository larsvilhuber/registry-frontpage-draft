abstract: "Does CEO gender influence how we perceive firm performance? While previous literature has explored the wealth of observational data on US public companies to document a correlation between beliefs about firm performance and CEO gender, establishing the causal link between these variables remains a challenge. In this paper, we take an experimental approach to address this issue. We design an experiment where the assignment of CEO gender is randomized and measure the extent to which gender affects participants’ forecasts of firm profits. In the experiment, participants predict the profits of three real US public companies, one of which has the gender of its CEO (disclosed via a picture) altered. For each company, participants first receive real data about its past financial performance, along with experts’ forecasts for future profits and form predictions for profits in the next two quarters. Then, they receive information about the actual profit for the first quarter and revise their prediction for the second quarter. The design includes a “good news” (profit realization higher than experts’ forecasts) versus “bad news” (profit realization lower than experts’ forecasts) treatment that allows us to test whether the effect of CEO gender on beliefs is intermediated through the sign of the news received. Finally, the study also includes questions aimed at determining the mechanism behind the dependency of beliefs about firm performance on CEO gender – e.g. do participants think that female CEOs are less skilled than their male peers?"
