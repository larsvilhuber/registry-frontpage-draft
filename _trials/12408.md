abstract: "We research whether management styles can be changed in public administration, and what mechanisms drive any change. This is a particularly important question given management has been shown to contribute to performance in public and private organizations. To do so, this study will show a video to Ethiopian civil servants undergoing training at the Ethiopian Management Institute that showcases a successful middle manager who overcomes a work problem with his team, by learning and using a particular management style.
