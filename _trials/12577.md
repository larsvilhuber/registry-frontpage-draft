abstract: "We study whether having more women in STEM departments increases female high school students’ preference for attending those departments through an incentivized hypothetical choice preference elicitation. Students are shown pairs of hypothetical college-department profiles and asked to choose which college-department they want to attend, as well as to state at which college-department they think they can better (i) succeed academically, (ii) find a career they want to pursue, (iii) adapt to the environment, and (iv) find a role model. We use the choices to study students’ preferences and use the statements to investigate the underlying mechanisms. We quantify the effect size using the willingness to pay in terms of school selectivity: how much female students are willing to reduce school selectivity to have more women in the STEM college-departments."
