abstract: "The goal of this study is to evaluate whether presenting patient out-of-pocket cost information to the provider at the time of prescribing leads to orders for medications with lower out-of-pocket costs.  We implement a real-time benefits check (RTBC) tool to randomly selected providers across NYU Langone Healthâ€™s outpatient physician practices. The RTPC tool provides physicians with information about patient out-of-pocket (OOP) cost for medications at the point of outpatient prescribing. If the physician is submitting a prescription order and a clinically-appropriate alternative with a lower OOP cost is available, an alert with OOP cost information for the drug being initially ordered as well as up to three lower-cost alternatives will be displayed. We will analyze whether implementation of this tool led to reduced out-of-pocket costs on ordered medications."
