abstract: " Temperature levels affect a range of important outcomes including productivity and learning. In this context, we are interested in looking at low cost solutions aimed at reducing ambient temperatures in anganwadis (a government run system of child care in rural India). Through our collaboration with the Energy Management Centre (EMC) of the state of Kerala we will be using roof paint with a high Solar Reflective index(SRI) to cool the roofs in anganwadis using a randomised controlled design. The study will look at the impact of cool roofs on indoor temperature, thermal comfort and also on attendance and cognitive effort of anganwadi students. We will be using administrative data on attendance along with data from primary surveys."
