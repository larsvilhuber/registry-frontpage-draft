abstract: "This study is a follow up to Ziegler et al. (2021) who find a pronounced deterioration of morals in markets where the replacement logic is available compared to both individual decision making and markets with trading quotas. With this study we intend to shed further light on the mechanisms driving the results. We do so by: (i) eliciting subjects beliefs about their probability of being pivotal; (ii) measuring the effect of market selection by comparing groups with homogeneous moral costs to groups with heterogeneous moral costs; (iii) studying a setting based on a simultaneous double-auction with private schedules."
