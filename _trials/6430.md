abstract: "Economic models of labour supply usually assume perfect, or at least constant, knowledge about tax policy, even though most economists would agree that we should expect stronger responses when policy is well-known. This neglect is understandable, given that no one knows how important such knowledge is. To fill this gap, we have conducted an experiment in which we sent half of all new parents in Sweden information about the Swedish EITC, in Swedish called Jobbskatteavdraget. Using Swedish registry data we will analyze how this treatment affected labor supply as well as the division of parental leave between the spouses.
