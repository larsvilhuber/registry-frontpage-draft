abstract: "A randomized field experiment in which parents of early elementary students received personalized information about the academic content their child missed when absent. Following an absence, school staff sent postcards to parents detailing how many days of school their child had missed alongside a handwritten note from their teacher summarizing the academic material covered during the absence. We randomized the intervention across schools and classrooms in two urban school districts. The sample consisted of over 5,500 students in preschool through second grade. Overall, the treatment reduced absences. "
