abstract: "Qualified teachers are a fundamental input for any education system. This paper presents the results of a large-scale intervention to attract high-performing high-school students into the teaching profession in Chile. The intervention was a three-arm campaign that made salient three types of motivations: intrinsic/altruistic, extrinsic, and prestige-related. There are two treatment arms. In the first one, a team of promoters from a specialized NGO implemented an intensive campaign based on a structured script implemented through WhatsApp messages and phone calls. In the second one, the campaign was delivered using a pre-programmed Bot that operates through WhatsApp. The third arm is a passive control that does not receive any message. We use real-world behavioral outcomes to measure the effectiveness of each type of intervention. These include the probability that a high-school student applies to a teaching degree, the probability that she includes a teaching degree among the most preferred options, and the probability that a high-school student is finally offered (and accepts) a position in a university to pursue a teaching major.
