abstract: "Increasing COVID-19 vaccination uptake is crucial for controlling the spread of COVID-19, economic recovery, and returning to normal or near-normal daily lives. However, even when supplies are increasingly available, COVID-19 vaccine take-up rates in many countries are still low owing to widespread vaccine hesitancy. We conduct a randomized controlled trial with individuals in rural Bangladesh to understand the barriers to vaccine take-up and identify the most effective way to increase it. We test several strategies: information about the benefits and risk about COVID-19 vaccines, information and accessibility assistance, and information and campaign by local eminent individuals.
