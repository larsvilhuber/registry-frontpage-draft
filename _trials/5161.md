abstract: "We study the impact of an innovative antianxiety digital treatment on performance in a cognitive demanding task using a randomized control trial design. We exogenously manipulate a cognitive bias associated with anxiety – the tendency to disproportionately
allocate attention to negative stimuli – in a group of young men and women using a digital treatment called Cognitive Bias Modification. CBM treatment reduces attention bias by training individual attention. It is a computer-based training in which pairs of threatening and neutral visual stimuli appear sequentially on the screen. The subject is trained to divert attention away from threatening stimuli by requiring repeated identification of the location of the neutral stimulus in a pair of neutral and threatening stimuli. We observe that the treatment reduces the cognitive bias of treated women and significantly improves their performance in the cognitive task."
