abstract: "Monsoon flooding has become more intense in recent years due to climate change and surpasses the ability of communities to cope, leading to the loss of livelihoods, assets and lives. It is often possible to predict severe monsoon flooding events. A targeted anticipatory approach has the promise to offer a more timely and effective solution that reduces the effects of the shock on household economic outcomes and welfare. In July 2020, the United Nations piloted a novel approach to humanitarian financing by employing a data-driven forecast to predict excess flooding along the Jamuna River in Bangladesh. This forecast was used to trigger the release of cash transfers worth $53 to 22,434 affected households a few days prior to the flooding shock. We evaluate the effect of an anticipatory cash transfer on household behaviour and outcomes during one of the most severe and protracted flooding events in decades."
