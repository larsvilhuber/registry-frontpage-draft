abstract: "Randomized clinical trials play a critical role in generating knowledge about the safety and efficacy of new pharmaceuticals. However, many clinical trials are not representative of the patient population the resulting pharmaceuticals would serve. In a randomized experiment, we aim to measure the extent to which patients have more demand for results from clinical trials that are more representative of their demographic group. "
