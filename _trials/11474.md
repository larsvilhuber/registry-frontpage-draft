abstract: "This experimental project studies perceptions on how the coarseness of moral categories affects moral behavior. Perceptions will be compared with actual data from a previous experiment (pre-registered as The Coarseness of Moral Language). The focus will be on the accuracy of peopleâ€™s perceptions and the amount of information lost due to potential misperceptions."
