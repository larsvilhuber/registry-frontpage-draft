abstract: "Inequality and social segregation are important topics in Economics. In this research, I study how inequality in primary school performance is driven by role models, and the extent to which children relate to them via gender and ethnicity. I run an experiment in English primary schools with random allocation to a role model intervention during exam preparation period in spring term. The treatment aims at raising self-efficacy for and providing information on the usefulness of Maths. The interventions occurred as video recordings of TED Talk-like speeches by successful STEM professionals of different gender and ethnicity. To measure the effect of role models on Maths attainment, I consider performance in standardized Maths tests two months after the intervention. I find positive effects on performance of pupils who watched a video of a speaker of the same gender. The effect is significant compared to seeing an opposite gender speaker, and no speaker at all in the control group."
