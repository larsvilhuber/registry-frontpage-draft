abstract: "This experiment plans to explore how behavioral tools affect parents' redemption rate of an online gift card. From 2021 to 2022, the Early Investment Project (EIP) by us, the Behavioral Insights and Parenting Lab at the University of Chicago, surveyed around 2000 parents with kindergarteners in the Chicago Public School system. For parents who completed the survey, we offered them a $20 gift card through an online gift card platform. We also provided $89 to a subset of parents who won the raffle from one survey question. By March 2023, we found out that, among 1932 parents in the EIP survey sample, 887 parents had yet to redeem the gift cards. To increase the gift card redemption rate with two behavioral approaches, we plan to separate these parents into two treatment groups and one control group. All groups will receive brief information through text messages and emails about the gift card with a link. Besides, one treatment group will receive a short sentence that encourages them to buy something for their children with the gift card. The other treatment group will receive a short sentence that phrases the gift card's value to an equivalent hourly wage. We will send these text messages and emails once a week for four consecutive weeks. We are interested in comparing the redemption rate among groups and its heterogeneity by baseline parental characteristics.

Round 2:
To increase the power for heterogenous treatment effect analysis, we plan to add another 312 parents who did not redeem the git card from a different project, AboutTime Experiment 1 and RCT. These 312 parents will be evenly split into the control group and the treatment group which will receive a short sentence that encourages them to buy something for their children with the gift card. Other experiment design and analysis remain the same.
