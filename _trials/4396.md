abstract: "Subjective well-being (SWB) has become a key tool to augment the usual measures of economic prosperity in order to proxy for welfare in sustainable development policies. In particular, the concept of life satisfaction as people’s own assessment of feelings and attitudes is included in numerous surveys across many countries, including the Gallup World Poll. For this reason, we aim to understand the robustness of this measurement in surveys. Specifically, we will look at question-order on self-reported life satisfaction questions. Our research questions are (i) does respondent’s perception of life satisfaction change when asked at the beginning or end of the questionnaire? and (ii) does respondent’s perception of life satisfaction change when asked directly after a sensitive question?
