abstract: "While a large body of research finds that in-person tutoring increases student achievement, little evidence exists concerning the effectiveness of online tutoring. This experiment assesses the effectiveness of a pilot high-dosage online tutoring program in Metro Nashville Public Schools on student achievement and attendance. Students assigned to treatment were paired with a volunteer college student or community volunteer and attended online tutoring sessions 3 times per week lasting 45 minutes during the school day for 5 to 6 weeks with their tutor. Tutors worked with students on relationship building and provided personalized academic tutoring. We will examine the impacts of this program on student achievement, grades, attendance, and behavior outcomes. Additionally, we will determine whether high-dosage online tutoring was more effective when delivered while kids are attending school in person or while they are attending school remotely."
