abstract: "Ultra-poor graduation programs (UPGs) aimed at creating sustainable livelihoods are the closest that development economics has come to a silver bullet for ultra-poverty alleviation. While in-kind, conditional and unconditional cash transfers have been shown to provide effective poverty relief and invigorate micro-enterprises in the short run, in-kind transfers or strong-handed conditionalities may induce distortionary effects, and the evidence on long-term effects is mixed at best. Skills training, coaching, or access to loans or savings facilities by themselves show few if any impacts. On the other hand, UPGs following the BRAC model (studied here) – monthly cash transfers, business start-up grants or productive assets, training, formation of savings groups, and one-on-one coaching – seem to be standing the test of time while providing results that are larger than the sum of their parts in response to the highly complex challenge that multidimensional poverty traps pose. I leverage the roll-out of a large UPG (monthly cash transfers + training + business start-up grant + ongoing coaching) for ultra-poor households in Malawi to conduct a randomized control trial that generates unique high frequency data and investigates the following sets of questions:

(0) The research study is built around an impact evaluation of the implementing NGO's "Childhoods and Livelihoods" child-focused UPG.

(1) By experimentally varying the program saturation, I provide evidence on whether livelihood-creation interventions can lead to self-defeating overcrowding or virtuous critical mass of micro-enterprises in small village economies.

(2) Poverty and economic shocks in Malawi are highly seasonal and exacerbated by climate change. We administer the program to three cohorts at different times in the agricultural season and ask: Is it best to provide households with the means to start businesses pre- or post-harvest or in the lean season?

(3) Throughout the program, treatment and control households are surveyed at (novel) high frequency to allow us to trace their path out of poverty and illuminate the role of seasonal shocks in upsetting their progress. What role do small and large day-to-day shocks play in turning poverty into a trap? How are UPGs, that have been shown elsewhere to effectively resolve poverty traps, able to overcome this challenge? What combination of shock resilience strategies does the UPG induce for treated households?

(4) A large literature aims to target entrepreneurship programs to the most promising beneficiaries, with only moderate success. I recast this prediction problem into a decomposition exercise between factors like ability that are at least in principle knowable and adverse shocks that afflict the firm or the household that runs it that we couldn’t hope to predict and are therefore unknowable. In a study design that allows me to leverage exogenous variation in entrepreneurs’ exposure to shocks, I estimate what share of the outcome heterogeneity observed in an entrepreneurship promotion program is due purely to events such as weather, health, social network, or price shocks, which in most contexts are beyond the control of implementers."
