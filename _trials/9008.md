abstract: "One of the most important functions of democracy is to aggregate preferences and information towards the choice of policies that deliver sound economic security in the long run. However, democracies that share similar institutions exhibit very different results in terms of the perceived ability of their governments to effectively offer economic security. Why, for example, do two similarly designed social democracies like Sweden and Italy differ so much in the implementation of their welfare plans? Why is the role of the federal state in guaranteeing economic security in the United States much smaller than in Germany? More broadly, what is the role played by inherited values and social norms—what we may collectively refer to as "culture"—in determining the functioning of institutions? And if culture affects the working of democratic institutions, should different cultures adopt different “versions” of democracy?

This project aims to explore the relationship between voters’ perception of the quality of democratic policy making processes and their support for long-term ambitious policies. In particular, the project will provide insights into how voters' perception of the efficacy of electoral accountability and their ability to select honest politicians affect their support for long-term and hard-to-verify policies. In particular, we are interested in studying whether voters with lower trust in politicians are more likely to vote for politicians that promise short-term and directly verifiable policies and whether voters with lower opinions of the quality of the media and institutions of electoral accountability are more likely to vote for politicians that promise short-term and directly verifiable policies.
