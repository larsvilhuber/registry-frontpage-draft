abstract: "This study evaluates the impact of interventions aimed at reducing residential electricity consumption during peak load days. The main intervention will increase the price of consuming electricity in the afternoon and early evening on 10 selected days in the period November 2019-April 2020. These days will be announced by text messages. The text messages will further ask participants to reduce consumption to try to reduce electricity consumption if possible. The group assigned to this intervention will be compared to an intervention group assigned to receiving similar information that a peak load day is upcoming, but that will face no price changes, and a control group. Starting from peak load day 4, a subset of customers in the two intervention groups will also receive information about their consumption relative to their neighbors on peak load days. "
