abstract: "Containing a pandemic, like the current Covid-19 pandemic, requires people to get vaccinated and to avoid unnecessary physical interactions with each other—that is, they have to stay at home and refrain from many social activities they normally like to undertake in the company of other people. This is a large-scale cooperation problem, where (some) people may have some incentives to break the rules for self-interested reasons but are thereby undermining the collective efficacy of containment strategies. Here, we are interested in the behavioral dimensions of people’s decisions to get vaccinated or not and to stay at home or not. There are several potentially relevant behavioral dimensions: People’s pro-social inclinations, their patience and risk preferences, their trust in the authorities, and their tendency to follow other people’s behavior may all play a part in decisions to get vaccinated and to stay at home. We therefore measure these preferences, using a mixture of tested survey tools (e.g., the Global Preference Survey and the Social Value Orientation test) and incentivized behavioral games (sequential prisoner’s dilemma, dictator game, and public goods game). We will also measure various motives to get vaccinated and to comply or not with the stay-at-home rules. We plan to run the study on Amazon Mechanical Turk in six waves of 600 participants each."
