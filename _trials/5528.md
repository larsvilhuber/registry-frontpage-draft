Burnout syndrome emanating from job-related stress is associated with employeesâ€™ physical and mental health conditions is a leading cause of work turnovers and undermined organizational outcomes.  This study investigated the effectiveness of Yoga-based cognitive behavioral therapy reducing occupational burnout among University teachers in Nigeria. Participants included 93 academic staff members from two Federal Universities in two States in Nigeria. Participants were randomly assigned to Y-CBT (N=46) and waitlist control (N=47) groups. The Y-CBT group participated in a 2 hours Y-CBT program weekly for a period of 12 weeks. Two instruments- Single Item Stress Questionnaire (SISQ) and Malach's Burnout inventory Educators' Survey (MBI-ES) were used to collect data.  Data were collected at baseline; post-test and follow-up evaluations. Means, standard deviations, t-test statistics, repeated measures ANOVA and bar charts were used to analyze data for the study. Results revealed a significant reduction in all the subscales of the MBI-ES at post-test, which were sustained through a 3-months follow up assessment among the Y-CBT group, compared to the waitlisted group. It was concluded that Y-CBT intervention helps to minimize the job-burnout among university teachers.
