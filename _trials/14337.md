abstract: "A well-established literature documents the general finding that people give less when there is a greater risk that their donation will have less impact. In this study, we will use a laboratory experiment to test an important relevant mechanism by which people use the risk that their donation will have less than the desired impact as an excuse not to give. We will test this selfishness excuse mechanism using a sample from Hong Kong and Macau. In the design of this laboratory experiment, subjects will make a series of binary choices between risky and riskless payoffs that can benefit themselves or a charity. A risky payoff is a lottery that yields a non-zero amount with probability P and 0CNY with probability 1-P.  This study replicates the design of Exley (2016), and aims to test the robustness of this mechanism to excuse selfishness using a sample from Hong Kong and Macau. "
