abstract: "This document outlines the analysis plan for the study of the effects of acute stress on temporal discounting and risk preference. Our subject pool consists of urban poor from two of the largest informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. We use a real-time centipede game as a manipulation of participants' stress. By randomly assigning participants to a stressful or non-stressful condition, we can estimate the causal impacts of acute stress on decision making. "
