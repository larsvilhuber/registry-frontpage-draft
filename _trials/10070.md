abstract: "I study an intervention that provides farmers with information regarding vitamin A content of biofortified varieties, the causes of stresses (weather or virus/disease related) to sweet potato cultivation and objectively measured information on characteristics of the varieties cultivated in Uganda. This study aims to test if changes in farmers' incorrect priors can lead to changes in adoption rates of disease resistant or biofortified sweet potato varieties and other agricultural practices. The intervention is motivated by the discrepancy found between: i) farmers’ self-reported information regarding the traits of the sweet potato varieties cultivated and, ii) the results of the DNA fingerprinting analysis; and by farmers’ misdiagnosis of the sources of yield loss (i.e. not recognizing symptoms of common diseases and mistaking them for climate-related stress).
