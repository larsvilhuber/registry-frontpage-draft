abstract: "We will implement a stratified randomized controlled trial to analyze whether an eight-week customized life-skills curriculum will allow vulnerable madrasah (religious school) students to attain mental resilience and favorable education outcomes. Adverse adolescent mental health in a resource-constrained environment affects lifetime and labor market outcomes negatively. Our life-skills curriculum has been developed by specialists in the field of psychology and education and is customized towards improving life chances of students from marginalized populations of Bangladesh. 

We hypothesize that the intervention will lower depression, promote a growth mindset, lower anxiety about school performance, improve self-esteem and future outlook, boost anger coping strategies, and enhance social interactions and perceived safety. 

This studyâ€™s population consists of 472 students attending grades 6 to 10 in Dhaka City. The objective is to gather evidence on the efficacy of the customized curriculum in the under-studied urban context of a developing country, and estimate social network effects.
