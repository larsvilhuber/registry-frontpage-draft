abstract: "We study whether information about future skill shortage affects firms’ expectations. We implement an information experiment among managers of small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) in Germany. Participants will be randomly provided with information from expert forecasts about the future shortage of skilled workers in Germany. After randomized information provision, participants will be asked about their general expectations regarding their firm’s performance. They will also be asked about their expectations about future skill shortage in their industry sector, and a series of questions how they perceive skill shortage, and how they plan to counteract it. The survey will be implemented as a pen and paper survey."
