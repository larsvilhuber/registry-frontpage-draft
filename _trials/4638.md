abstract: "Kunreuther et al. (2013) document a phenomenon whereby the demand for disaster insurance increases after a disaster and then falls when no further disasters arise, even when no serial correlation is present. If individuals were perfect Bayesian learners, we would expect these responses to disappear asymptotically, but they appear to be persistent in equilibrium. These “insurance cycles” can be explained by a more general phenomenon called recency bias where more recent events have an out-sized impact on beliefs and behavior. New theoretical work in Neligh (2019) has demonstrated how recency bias and insurance cycles can naturally result from a rational memory model where memories decay over time, but individuals preserve their memories better by expending costly cognitive resources. In this paper, we conduct an experiment testing some predictions of the rational memory model in an insurance purchasing game.  We also test whether player behavior is better described by a rational memory model or a traditional reinforcement learning model by separately manipulating the value of information and the reward associated with it.
