abstract: "We investigate the impact of short-term subsidies on demand for a novel preventative health product in rural Bihar, India. Short-term subsidies may induce anchoring effects – in which recipients reference the low price they previously faced, undervaluing the product on future offer, or learning effects – wherein recipients experience the positive benefits of the product, leading to higher future valuation and use. This study seeks to determine which of these mechanisms dominate. To test for these potential mechanisms, this study explores the promotion of a novel health product – potable water delivery to 20-liter jugs – recently introduced in the Supaul region of rural Bihar by a local NGO and growing in popularity throughout states in north and central India."
