abstract: "We study how German Members of Parliament (MPs) respond to disclosure of their outside earnings and activities. We use administrative tax return data and exploit institutional changes for federal MPs. To shed light into the mechanisms behind our findings, we aim to complement our results by adding a survey experiment among voters. We experimentally vary profiles of hypothetical MPs along several dimensions, one of which are outside earnings, and let voters rate them along several dimensions."
