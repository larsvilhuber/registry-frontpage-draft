abstract: "This paper examines how a commitment device – an arrangement to willingly bind future choices to help achieve a personal goal – might be applied to health behaviours for weight loss, building on Thaler and Shefrin’s (1981) planner-doer theory. It reports on a field experiment that tests the effects of a financial and reputational commitment device offered to clients of an online weight loss service. Findings suggest commitment devices may play a useful role as a public policy instrument, but design and targeting matter.
