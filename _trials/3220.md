abstract: "Education is known to affect the labor market prospects of individuals. The literature shows that individuals' beliefs about how education influences labor market prospects plays a role in their decisions on whether and in what program to enroll. While the number of field-experimental studies on the role of labor market information in educational choices is growing, a number of key issues have not been dealt with yet. First, while information is often presented by an individual, the way in which the identity of the information presenter influences the way in which the receiver uses that information is unclear. Second, none of the existing studies have looked at the potentially detrimental effect of information overload. With this paper, we hope to provide more evidence on the effect of labor market information on education decisions and fill in some of the above mentioned gaps in the literature."
