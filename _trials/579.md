abstract: "This trial aims to increase the wellbeing of tuberculosis patients and their adherence to medication in Chisinau, The Republic of Moldova. The design is an individually randomised controlled trial (RCT) and will involve 200 TB patients during their ‘continuation phase’ of treatment. The trial will have two arms; 100 patients will form the control group and receive the standard provision of Directly Observed Treatment (DOT) and 100 will receive Virtually Observed Treatment (VOT). VOT differs from DOT in that the daily observation of patients taking their medication will be observed via internet video calling rather than in-person. Based on a small sample of patient interviews we think that for some patients DOT may be a hindrance rather than a help. VOT allows patients to take their treatment in the comfort of their home and means they don’t have to travel to their polyclinic every day. The trial design will be implemented by Act for Involvement (AFI) and the Ministry of Health in Moldova. The trial will be available to patients that have access to a computer, smartphone or any device that can run Skype. Two VOT observation centres will be set up; one at AFI and one in an existing polyclinic. The trial duration will dependent on the number of eligible patients but is expected to take 16 months.
