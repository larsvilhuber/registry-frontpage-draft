abstract: "The aim of this study is to provide causal evidence on the link between pollution and antisocial behaviour. We plan to estimate the causal impact of air pollution on economic decision-making by exploiting exogenous variation in local air pollution in Beijing, China. The primary outcomes of interest are experimental measures of antisocial behaviour obtained using incentivized experimental games including the 'Take Game' (as a measure for crime in the lab), 'Joy of Destruction Game' (as a measure of anti-social behaviour) and a third-party punishment game (as a measure of enforcement of pro-social behaviour). We also collect a range of secondary outcomes, which constitute potential mechanisms for effects on the primary outcomes, including tests of cognitive capacity, revealed measures for risk and time preferences and self-reported levels of mood, stress, anxiety and self-control. Experiments will be conducted with a large sample of students from Universities in Beijing."
