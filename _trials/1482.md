abstract: "Asymmetric information between employers and employees is a key determinant of contractual arrangements and firm outcomes. We report on a randomized controlled trial estimating the effect of reducing information asymmetry on contracts, productivity and driver safety via a new monitoring technology in Kenya’s informal public transport industry. This industry is dominated by small-scale entrepreneurs hiring minibus (matatu) drivers on a daily basis using residual-claimant schemes to ensure effort. We fit minibuses in both the treatment and control group with monitoring devices equipped with GPS and accelerometers recording high-frequency data on productivity and safety performance of drivers. Minibus owners in the treatment group receive information on driver effort and output via smartphone app. Owners and drivers in both treatment group and control group submit daily data on business outcomes to document how contracts change and how this subsequently affects productivity and safety."
