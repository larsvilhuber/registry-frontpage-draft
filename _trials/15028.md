abstract: "This project investigates how perceptions of behavioral traits are gendered, focusing on traits such as negotiation aggression, risk-taking, and workplace competitiveness. Through an online experiment, we aim to determine if these traits are perceived differently based on gender. Participants are randomly assigned identical scenarios depicting either men or women behaving in a certain way in workplace interactions. Respondents then provide an assessment of how they rate behaviors as well as (incentivized) assessments of how they think others rate the same situation.
