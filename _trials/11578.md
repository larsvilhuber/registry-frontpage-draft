abstract: "Restorative justice, as a model of justice that seeks to resolve conflicts through dialogue, agreement, accountability, and reparation of harm, has played a leading role in improving access to justice and reconstructing social and family relationships affected by the conflict. However, this model is not used frequently by citizens and State agents due to multiple factors ranging from shortcomings in its regulation to cultural beliefs regarding its effectiveness in resolving criminal conflicts. Instead, they prefer retributive justice mechanisms. To identify these biases, we propose an information provision survey experiment where we randomly give the respondent information about the effectiveness and reparation of the restorative justice mechanisms. This survey is run in 12 municipalities in Colombia highly affected by the armed conflict."
