abstract: "The trial examines the impacts of a HealthTeacher, a popular online K-12 health education program used by hundreds of school districts around the United States. The trial focuses specifically on an enhanced version of HealthTeacher's main sex education module for middle school students. The trial involves a sample of 7th grade students from 17 Chicago public middle schools. Among participating schools, about half were randomly assigned to a treatment group that provided HealthTeacher to 7th grade students during winter and spring of the 2010-2011 school year. The other half were assigned to a control group that did not provide the program. Follow-up data were collected over an 18-month period, through spring of 2012 when the students were in 8th grade. This study of HealthTeacher is part of the broader Evaluation of Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Approaches (PPA) study, a major federal effort to expand available evidence on effective ways to prevent and reduce pregnancy and related sexual risk behaviors among teens in the United States."
