abstract: "This study explores the impact of (no) choice in information acquisition on learning outcomes in the context of health communication. Decisions about investments into health are often made under uncertainty by individuals who lack perfect information. Information provision interventions are used to counteract this by supplying accurate information. However, these interventions often fail to improve participantsâ€™ knowledge or shift their decisions towards the optimum. This study investigates one potential reason for this: the fact that the way that information is acquired affects the extent of learning. I study whether giving individuals a choice in accessing information about the new malaria vaccine affects their attention to the information and their resulting knowledge about, and support for, the vaccine. I do this in a survey experiment conducted in Ghana where I randomly assign participants to 1) passively watch a placebo video about child development; 2) passively watch the treatment video about the malaria vaccine; 3) the choice group, where participants express a preference between the placebo and treatment videos. In group 3, there is a further randomisation of participants following the choice; some watch the video they preferred, while others watch the video they did not prefer. I compare how individuals respond to the treatment video if they watch it passively, watch it "keenly" (after choosing it), or watch it "forcedly" (after choosing against it). Through this study, I seek to inform health communication strategies, particularly in the context of emerging health interventions.
