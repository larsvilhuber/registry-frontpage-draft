abstract: "Collective action is essential for addressing the grand challenges of our time. However, for such action to be successful, decision-making processes must be perceived as legitimate. In this study, we investigate the legitimacy of different voting methods.

Using a pre-registered human subject experiment, 120 participants cast their votes using four voting methods: majority voting, combined approval voting, score voting and modified Borda count. These methods represent a range of preference elicitation designs, from low to high complexity and flexibility. 
Furthermore, we developed a legitimacy scale upon which the participants rate the voting methods.
The experiment was conducted in a non-political setting (voting on colour preferences) and a political context (voting on COVID-19-related questions).

Our findings suggest that the perceived legitimacy of a voting method is context-dependent. Specifically, preferential voting methods are considered more legitimate than majority voting in political decision-making, but only for individuals with well-defined preferences. 

Furthermore, preferential voting methods are more legitimate than majority voting in a highly polarized situation.
