abstract: "Today, individuals commonly disclose personal data to enjoy the benefits of data-driven services, such as personalized user interfaces and targeted content recommendations. Next to these personal benefits, data from individuals can also create great societal returns in the public interest. In this spirit, several countries have introduced mobile tracking apps in response to the COVID 19-pandemic, to facilitate contact tracing based on the continuous collection of users’ contact data with others. However, such tracking apps can only represent effective building blocks for a nation’s public health strategy if individuals are willing to voluntarily donate their data by installing and using these apps. Despite the potential societal benefits, empirical research on data donations is still scarce. In particular, it is unknown which mechanism can be effective in encouraging individuals to donate their data in the public interest and whether monetary payments can increase the willingness to contribute data. Previous studies on other types of donations, such as blood donations, show that monetary compensation can crowd out intrinsic motivation and altruistic motives, and thus, reduce the number of blood donors. However, in the context of data, monetary compensation could provide a short-term stimulus that may foster long-term data donations. To address this empirical research question, we run an experimental study and compare the effect of different incentives on participants’ willingness to donate data. Altogether, our findings provide timely evidence on how to encourage data donations in the interest of public health."
