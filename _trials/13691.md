abstract: "Our project investigates personal data privacy and the monetization of personal data by digital finance platforms, particularly focusing on the value retail investors place on the privacy of their trading activity (i.e., their investor sophistication level, as well as the history of the orders they sent to the market and history of the orders that were executed). We collect this data using experiments on a realistic and sophisticated trading simulation platform we developed ourselves. We collect data on how much individual retail investors care about having their personal trading activity shared with other market players, by conducting a controlled experiment where we observe a privately informed individual’s trading behaviour when made aware (or not) about their personal trading history being shared with other market participants. We assess the implied monetary compensation for an individual’s data privacy by considering any changes in the timing of trades, the size, and the type of the orders (i.e., market or limit orders) between the different information regimes. We also look at the trading profits obtained by individual investors. In surveys that follow the completion of the experiment, we also collect standard demographics data (age, gender, education, etc.), data on attitudes towards risk and experience with stock market trading, as well as data on the subjective monetary value they would require as compensation for complete privacy on digital platforms. The data we collect is very rich and allows exploration of data valuations across demographic groups, market conditions, and availability of private information, contributing to the understanding of privacy's true value and the impact of different information treatments."
