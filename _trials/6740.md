abstract: "Previous research has shown that supported employment is effective in helping individuals with mental illness into employment. In this study, we will report on a large-scale RCT among people with partial work capacity in general, and be able to study the effects of supported employment for people with reduced work capacity. The RCT was conducted in collaboration with the Norwegian Labor and Welfare Administration. Individuals with reduced work capacity in 7 counties in Norway were randomized to supported employment focusing on “place-than-train”, or traditional vocational services based on the “train/treat-then-place” idea. The randomization started in May 2014 and lasted until December 2017, comprising 43 months of randomization. We will use administrative register data to analyse the effects on employment outcomes as well as participation in various welfare programs. Data will be received on November 16 2020. "
