abstract: "The trial seeks to identify a cost-effective, yet productivity-enhancing programme of peer-group learning for family business SMEs which can be replicated and run at scale.
The experiment addresses a key problem faced by the long-tail of low-productivity businesses in England by seeking to reduce barriers to the adoption of digital technologies that have been demonstrated to increase productivity.
By selecting family businesses with low rates of digital technology adoption and working with them in facilitated peer-groups the trial seeks to provide: 
- the demonstration of measurable improvements in intent to adopt productivity enhancing digital technologies
 - evidence of some adoption of the technologies before the end of the trial 
- in the longer term, measurable increases in productivity, shown using data-matching methods"
