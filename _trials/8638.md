abstract: "In this paper, we investigate the usually assumed trade-off between income and leisure in labor supply decisions based on two different studies. In a first study, we use comprehensive German panel data to compare non-employed individuals after plant closures with employed people regarding both income and time use as well as their subjective perceptions of these two factors. We find that the gain of non-working time translates into higher satisfaction with free time, while time spent on hobbies increases to a lesser extent than home production. Additionally, satisfaction with family life increases, which may be a hidden benefit of being unemployed. In contrast, satisfaction with income strongly declines when becoming jobless. Identity utility from earning a living may play the role of a hidden benefit of employment. To learn more about the role of social pressure to earn a living, we investigate the mechanisms underlying our main results using an experimental approach. In a second study, we therefore conduct a survey experiment based on hypothetical decisions of individuals who either accept or reject job offers. Study participants assess the social appropriateness of these two decisions, which in comparison reveals the social norm against living off other people. By varying the context, our experimental design also allows us to empirically test a possible compensation of social pressure to work via home production and to study the potential role of gender differences. The second study is what we pre-register here."
