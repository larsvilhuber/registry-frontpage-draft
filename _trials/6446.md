abstract: "We introduce loss aversion in the infinite horizon, alternating offers model. When outside options serve as reference points, the equilibrium of our model follows the standard Rubinstein subgame perfect equilibrium. However, when reference points are given by the
resources players contribute to the pie, the bargaining outcome changes such that a player's share increases in her contribution. 
The model is to be tested in two laboratory experiments. In experiment 1 random and earned outside options are compared. In experiment 2 random and earned contributions are compared. "
