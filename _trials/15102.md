abstract: "Job seekers’ beliefs about their reemployment prospects likely influence their reemployment outcomes. Overoptimistic individuals may (or may not) exert low job search effort and set high reservation wages, staying unemployed for longer; while pessimistic ones may (or may not) exert high search effort and low reservation wages, settling for low-quality jobs. In this study we aim to experimentally evaluate the impact of an information intervention that corrects job seekers’ possibly biased beliefs on job search behavior and labor market outcomes. We will estimate both a reduced-form causal effect of our treatment on belief updating and job outcomes, as well as identify an equilibrium search model that enables counterfactual policy experiments. Results will contribute to a better understanding of the role of job seekers’ expectations in amplifying labor market frictions, and will help inform the design of scalable, low-cost active labor market policy interventions to improve reemployment outcomes."
