abstract: "The purpose with this project is to evaluate if a job-matching intervention, based on formal as well as informal skills, can improve labour market opportunities for new arrivals in Sweden. The control intervention consists of regular services provided by the Swedish Employment Service (PES) which is more oriented towards preparatory courses and providing basic education, and when matching occurs, it primarily considers job seekersâ€™ formal skills. Job search assistance (JSA) has been found to be an efficient tool to reduce unemployment (Card et al., 2010, 2017). Recent evidence suggest that job-matching and vacancy referrals are important mechanisms behind the effect (Cheung et al., 2019). However, matching is normally based on formal competences and therefore not available for job-seekers lacking education and relevant labour market experience. Such job-seekers are often classified as non-matchable and assigned to preparatory programs for which there are no evidence of increasing transition to employment."
