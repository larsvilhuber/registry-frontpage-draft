abstract: "We propose a non-parametric method that allows us to identify the factors that drive observed effects using treatment comparisons. We implement this method in a laboratory experiment where participants choose between piece rate and tournament pay and use it to estimate the importance of a number of key drivers of the often-observed gender gap in tournament entry, including the role of selection into tournament and the role of externalities on othersâ€™ payoffs typically not considered in the literature. We also compare the results of our method to previous estimates that rely on parametric regression-based method to identify the drivers of the gender gap in willingness to compete. Finally, we intend to use our estimates to design environments in which tournament entry is brought in line with different policy goals."
