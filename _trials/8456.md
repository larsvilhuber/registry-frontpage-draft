abstract: "The Saving for Every Child Program (SECP) is a universal child savings account program in Israel administered by the National Insurance Institute of Israel (NII). The government opens a savings account for every newborn, and the government deposits approximately NIS 51 (New Israeli Shekel, equivalent to USD 15.5) per month to these accounts. Parents can transfer additional funds from a separate child allowance into the long-term savings account and select a specific savings account for their children.  

This study will examine how the small changes in letters and text messages that the government sends to parents of each newborn in Israel will affect parentsâ€™ decisions to enroll in and engage with the SECP. We will randomly assign parents to the control group that will be exposed to the current SECP design or one of several treatment conditions, where the design of each condition will be informed by behavioral economics.  We expect that programmatic changes in the SECP communication channels will encourage parents to make program-related decisions that will result in greater long-term savings for their children.  

We expect that the study will have significant implications for the design and implementation of the current program as well as savings and asset-building programs more generally.  "
