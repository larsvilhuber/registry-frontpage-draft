abstract: "Savings have been shown to reduce vulnerability and allow investments in human and physical capital that are needed to escape poverty. Yet saving rates in developing countries are very low. This begs the question of how to increase savings among low-income individuals. In this experiment in all regions of Uganda, we test two interventions against a "bare account" benchmark: first, savings "coaching" by phone and SMS, and second, the promise of a savings-driven loan conditional on regular savings. Outcomes include savings activity and savings balances, and progress towards clients' personal saving goals."
