abstract: "We regularly observe a perceived favorite losing out to an unlikely underdog in competitions. We can think of such an upset in terms of an all-pay auction model where a player with a high payoff relevant signal losing to a player with a lower signal. There exist a unique equilibrium in an all-pay auction model with arbitrarily correlated signals and interdependent valuations. The equilibrium is weakly monotone, in which the strong set order orders the bids, and yet, a player with a low signal can under certain correlation structures cause an upset by outbidding a high signal player. The aim of this project is to study this issue by way of an economic experiment."
