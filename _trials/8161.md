abstract: "Information constraints rank high among barriers to agricultural technology adoption. Demonstration plots, farmer-training schools, and farmer-to-farmer exchanges have proved effective tools for generating and sharing agricultural information, but many farmers face barriers to access due to high transportation and opportunity costs associated with in-person trainings, or the lack of such programs nearby. Information communication technologies (ICTs) are emerging to extend the reach of agricultural training, with high potential to deliver information through mobile and smartphones at little or no cost to farmers. In this study, we test the effectiveness of a digital platform, ShambaChat, that encourages peer learning among farmers in adopting a complex bundle of new practices that enhances soil fertility."
