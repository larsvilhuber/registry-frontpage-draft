abstract: "What messaging will convince Tanzanians to get a COVID-19 vaccine? We propose to use a randomized placebo-controlled trial, to evaluate an SMS campaign targeting Tanzanian mobile phone subscribers with two different SMS content aimed at increasing vaccine take up. We hypothesize different mechanisms by which Tanzanians may be induced to agree to get a COVID-19 vaccine including (1) altruism for others (empathy); and (2) COVID-19â€™s long term health impacts (Self interest). A placebo group of mobile subscribers will receive an SMS unrelated to the aforementioned interventions. We intend to share the effective messages, in addition to information on where to access vaccinations, with everyone in our sample no more than 3 months after treatment. Our proposed work is expected to inform literature on the social science of persuasion more broadly but specifically as it relates to persuading adults to take up health interventions, in particular, a COVID-19 vaccine. We expect our results to be highly informative not only for Tanzanian public health policy but also more broadly by providing precise estimates of precise content that may help increase COVID-19 vaccine take up and accelerate an end to this pandemic."
