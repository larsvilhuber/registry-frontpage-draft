abstract: "We are conducting a study to learn about the relative effectiveness of different types of emotional donation appeals on donation behavior and re-engagement. We will invite social media users to find their "charity soulmate" in a chatbot quiz on Facebook Messenger that matches them to a highly-rated (by Charity Navigator) charity. Participants will then be randomized into no intervention as a baseline, or one of the two treatment interventions: obligation or opportunity. All participants will choose whether they want to donate and/or re-engage with the chatbot. For those who want to re-engage, we will share additional content every two weeks for twelve weeks following the matching chatbot."
