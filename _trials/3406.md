abstract: "We embed a large-scale randomized controlled experiment within an existing volunteer tutor program of BRAC in Bangladesh to examine the effects of offering non-financial incentives on volunteers’ dropout rates and performance. Tutors are assigned randomly into one of three treatment groups several months after they have signed up to the volunteer program. In the first group, tutors are offered a certificate of excellence awarded in a public ceremony conditioning on their students having achievement gains. If their students do not experience achievement gains, they are awarded a certificate of appreciation in private. In the second group, tutors are also offered a certificate of excellence awarded conditioning on their students having achievement gain, but the certificate is awarded privately. If their students do not experience achievement gains, they are awarded a certificate of appreciation in private. In the third group, tutors are awarded a certificate of appreciation in private regardless of their students’ performance. Differences in dropout rates and student performance across treatments inform us whether offering the performance-contingent certificate is effectively in improving retention and performance of volunteers and whether volunteers are motivated by image-concerns."
