abstract: "The Wilson Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunities (LEO) at the University of Notre Dame has partnered with Strategies to End Homelessness (STEH) in Ohio to evaluate the effectiveness of their Shelter Diversion Program. This program is designed to prevent homelessness by providing housing identification support, rental assistance, and comprehensive case management services to individuals and families who are at risk of becoming homeless.

The study will employ a randomized control trial (RCT) to assess the impact of the Shelter Diversion Program on reducing emergency shelter use, engagement with street outreach services, and additional calls to the Central Access Point (CAP) helpline. Additionally, the evaluation will explore long-term outcomes related to housing stability, economic well-being, and criminal justice involvement. The study population includes individuals with no income or incomes at or below 15% of the Area Median Income (AMI) who have experienced housing instability in the past month.

Participants will be randomly assigned to either the treatment group, which will receive the Shelter Diversion Program services, or a control group, which will receive referrals to other housing resources in the community. The results from this study will contribute valuable insight into the effectiveness of shelter diversion as a strategy to prevent homelessness and stabilize housing for vulnerable populations. We plan to enroll approximately 1,760 individuals over two years, with the option to extend to a third year depending on partner capacity.
