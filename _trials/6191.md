abstract: "Governments and educational organizations worldwide are trying to quickly adapt to the unprecedented circumstances created by the pandemic, by developing or scaling up distance education modalities to continue delivering educational content to students and maintain students’ connection to formal education. This study evaluates four interventions designed to reduce the barriers to remote education. The first two treatment arms target information constraints: The first provides information about remote learning options, and the second provides information about an adaptive learning internet resource. The last two treatment arms target price constraints:  The third reduces the cost of internet learning activities by providing a discounted data package, and the fourth pairs students with a teacher that provides weekly support. 

The main outcomes of interest include parents' and students’ time and economic investments in remote education, take up and usage of remote learning resources, and learning outcomes."
