abstract: "Existing research on how innovation occurs largely assume that innovativeness is an inherent characteristic of an individual and that people with this innate ability select into jobs that require innovativeness. While we have some understanding of how well-designed incentives can lead innovators to take on riskier and more innovative projects, little is known about what can be done, if anything, to induce those who do not identify themselves as innovators to assume that role. In this project, we are running a natural field experiment within an innovation contest for undergraduate students at a highly ranked engineering department that will allow us to study this question. In particular, we will study whether people who may not self-select into being innovators can be induced to innovate, whether they innovate differently than those who do self-select into innovating, and whether they respond differently to confidence boosting messages.
