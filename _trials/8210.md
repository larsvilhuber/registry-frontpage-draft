abstract: "Schools in Bangladesh have been closed since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Partnering with the Global Development and Research Initiative (GDRI), a research-focused NGO operating in the South-West region of Bangladesh, we delivered two educational interventions to primary school-age children free of charge. The children in these two interventions were randomly selected. In this study, we aim to investigate whether receiving philanthropic benefits affect peopleâ€™s preference for redistribution. We will use standard lab-in-the-field experiments for this purpose."
