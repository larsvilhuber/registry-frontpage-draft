abstract: "This study aims to collect data both on strategic decision-making and on individual’s ability of assessing other’s intentions, beliefs and emotions, known as Theory of Mind (ToM). We use a sets of ring game (Kneeland, 2015) as well as our altered version ring game with focal strategies, as a measure of strategic sophistication. Particularly, we are interested to see if subject's level of strategic sophistication is sensitive to the focal strategy we created, and whether subjects are able to perform best responses when strategic uncertainty is reduced. We use an eye-gaze test (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001) as a measure of ToM ability. We conduct a laboratory experiment with 200 subjects. "
