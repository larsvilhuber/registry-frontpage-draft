abstract: "This field experiment further investigates the discrimination of Ukrainians in elementary school admission primary in the Czech Republic focusing on the effects of the war in Ukraine and the treatment of refugees. Our previous experiment (https://doi.org/10.1257/rct.7362) identified the presence of discrimination against Ukrainians of a large magnitude (a 21 percentage points, s.e. 2.3 p.p., lower response rate to queries from putatively Ukrainian senders, compared to 47 percent response rate to queries from putatively Czech senders). Over the past several weeks, about 300 000 refugees (officially registered), with almost 17000 children aged 3-6, arrived in the Czech Republic. This creates a demand shock on schools and the need to accommodate Ukrainian children. (There are typically about 100 000 first-graders each year.) Therefore, further understanding the discrimination Ukrainians may face is of utmost importance. The two aims of this experiment are (i) to update our previous estimates of discrimination faced by Ukrainians, specifically to ascertain whether the discriminatory attitudes changed in the face of the war, and (ii) to ascertain whether refugees are treated differently from the settled Ukrainian minority."
