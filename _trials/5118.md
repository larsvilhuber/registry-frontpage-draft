abstract: "Medicine overuse and misuse have became a subsequent issue once access is expanded. Antibiotic resistance is one serious consequence and its major contributor â€“ antibiotics overuse and misuse are particularly prevalent in developing countries. In a context of weak regulation enforcement on the health service provider side, we propose a potential approach to address this issue from patient's demand. Partnered with a community health center in China, we examine whether sending people text messages of potential harm associated with antibiotics misuse and overuse could reduce demand and therefore reduce total purchase. Moreover, we design the experiment to evaluate the relative effectiveness of self- and social- interest messages.
