abstract: "Online substance-use-disorder treatment programs face the common challenge of keeping individuals committed to their initial goals to complete the program. In this study, we experimentally test the effect of sunk costs on resolve to complete the program and achieve self-set goals. We focus on subjects with use-disorder concerning an array of substances and activities — alcohol, cannabis, gambling, cocaine, smoking — who voluntarily enroll in a free online self-help program consisting of several modules. We manipulate the “cost” of participation in the program by varying the ease with which subjects can (1) start module 1 and (2) transition from module 1 to module 2. We hypothesize that those subjects who faced higher sunk costs of participation will display (1) higher rates of program completion, (2) longer program engagement as compared to a control group, (3) higher rates of achievement of self-set goals, (4) reduced cravings, and (5) higher self-reported motivation. We will also be able to assess whether flat or escalating temptations are more effective in cementing resolve. Finally, we will run a heterogeneity analysis and a voluntary post-experimental survey."
