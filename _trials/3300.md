abstract: "We run a randomized controlled trial with school children aged 10-16 in Falkenberg and Varberg municipality, Sweden. Roughly 400-500 students across at least 33 school classes are expected to participate in the study. Randomization occurs within classes. Both treated and control students are visited by the experimenters and given an exercise. Treated students are asked to measure, each day over a period of one week, the amount of waste generated in their household. Control students face a placebo task of measuring the outdoor temperature. In a subsequent session, treated students listen to a brief lecture on waste and the environment, participate in a subsequent group discussion, and play an educational game. Control students take part in a similar educational session on weather. We then couple the home addresses provided by students with household-level waste data to examine the differential effect of the waste-themed interventions on the waste generated by households where a child was treated."
