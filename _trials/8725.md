abstract: "Agricultural chains are characterized by imperfect markets and contract enforcement. Under these circumstances, buyers and sellers benefit from long-term relationships based on mutual trust. While recent research has made progress in understanding the functioning of these relationships, little is known about how successful relationships can be established, organized, and deployed at scale to benefit smallholder farmers in a cost-effective way. In partnership with a leading coffee exporter, we have set up a pilot in which we design, implement and evaluate the impact of a farmer development program that aims to build relationships between farmers and the company."
