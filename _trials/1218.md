abstract: "The objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of Engaging Men in Accountable Practice (EMAP) on the prevention of violence against women and girls in North and South Kivu (DRC). The study is conducted jointly by the World Bank’s Africa Gender Innovation Lab and the International Rescue Committee (IRC). EMAP is a program developed and implemented by the IRC to engage men to reflect on how they can reduce and prevent intimate partner violence through 16 weekly group discussion sessions. The study is a cluster randomized control trial in which two groups of 25 self-selected men in 15 communities receive the EMAP intervention while in 15 other communities, 50 self-selected men receive an alternative intervention. Key outcomes examined include: (i) Experience of past year physical, sexual and psychological violence reported by women whose partners are EMAP participants; (ii) Participant’s gender attitudes and behaviors, conflict and hostility management skills; (iii) Power sharing and communication within the couple."
