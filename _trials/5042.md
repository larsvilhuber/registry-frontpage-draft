abstract: "In this study, we investigate the presence and stability of dynamically inconsistent time preferences across contexts with and without interpersonal trade-oﬀs. In a longitudinal experiment, across six different treatments, subjects make a series of intertemporal allocation decisions of real-eﬀort tasks between themselves and another person. "
