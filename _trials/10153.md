abstract: "We conduct an experiment with female ward members in Nepal to test whether providing information about the gender composition of selection committees and the electability of women into open, not quota-protected seats, raises the probability that female ward members vie for higher positions in the 2022 local election, particularly for the position of ward chair. The research design consists of a pre- and a post-election component.

In the pre-election component, we randomize respondents into five experimental groups: i) participants in the pure control group (and all other experimental groups) are called over the phone and asked to confirm their identify and party affiliation. Participants in the remaining experimental groups are asked additional questions and/or given pieces of information: ii) participants in the control with questions group are in addition asked about their estimate of the size and gender composition of their party’s ward committee and the share of females in ward member positions that secured more votes than the ward chair in the respective ward during the 2017 local election; iii) participants in the treatment A on committees group are in addition asked about their estimate of the size and gender composition of their
party’s ward committee and subsequently given information about a recently enacted gender quota to boost female membership on selection committees and the fact that female selection committee members are more favorable towards female aspirants than their male counterparts; iv) participants in the treatment B on votes group are in addition asked about their estimate of the share of females in ward
member positions that secured more votes than the ward chair in the respective ward during the 2017 local election and are subsequently truthfully informed about the actual share; v) participants in the treatment A on committees and B on votes group are asked both sets of questions and given both pieces of information.

After the 2022 local election, we test the effect of our intervention on participants’ aspirations to vie for the ward chair position (or run for other, higher authority seats), success in securing nomination and candidacy, and on electoral outcomes.

We assemble and leverage a combination of novel data sets: pre- and post-election phone surveys with female ward members, parties’ internal nomination lists, and administrative data on candidates and electoral outcomes.
