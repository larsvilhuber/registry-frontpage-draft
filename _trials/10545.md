abstract: "How should scarce resources be allocated in developing countries? Weitzman (1977) highlights a trade-off between prices, which generate allocative efficiency, and quotas, which might have desirable distributional consequences.  In partnership with a private company supplying clean water to rural Odisha, India, we plan to run an experiment to measure the relative effectiveness of different allocation mechanisms. We will measure the price elasticity of demand for clean water, health effects from consuming clean water, and the extent to which liquidity constraints and intra-household inefficiencies reduce consumption. To do so, we implement a cluster-randomized trial, where 160 villages are randomized into a pure control group and multiple treatment arms: (i) discounts; (ii) a monthly quota; and (iii) an exchangeable quota, where unused allocation can be exchanged for cash. We subsequently randomize which households within each treatment village will receive treatment. We plan to measure effects of treatment on water consumption and health outcomes using a combination of survey and administrative data."
