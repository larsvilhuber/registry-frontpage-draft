abstract: "I test for an illusion of control effect using direct elicitations of experimental participants' mental models and identify targeted learning as an economic mechanism driving the bias. Participants learn from a multivariate dataset before taking actions involving one variable and stating their beliefs about the data-generating process (i.e., relationships between variables). Illusion of control refers to a tendency to believe one's own action variable as outcome-relevant. Different treatments allow me to disentangle targeted learning about the action variable as a potentially important mechanism that organically generates the effect."
