abstract: "This randomized  controlled  trial  (RCT) is aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of an intervention to increase the uptake of Sustainable Land Management Practices (SLMPs) in arid Sub-Saharan Africa.  The intervention is a modified version of a ‘cascade training scheme’ through which we test whether, and by how much, financial incentives can help increase SLMPs adoption.  More specifically, we test the effectiveness of two types of financial compensation schemes.  In one treatment arm only the ‘peer farmers’ are offered compensation conditional on their adopting SLMPs;  in the other, the financial payment is split between the peer and the contact farmer so that the latter has a direct financial stake in fostering SLMP adoptionby their peer farmers.  The first treatment arm directly stimulates demand for information in the  knowledge transfer  stage (stage  2);  the second  provides direct  incentives  for  the supply of information as well.  The  key  hypotheses  tested  in  this  project  are  (i)  that  the  provision  of  financial  incentives  results  in  more  frequent  exchange  of  information  in  stage  2  (compared  to  the outcomes of the cascade training scheme without any financial incentives in the control group) as well as in higher adoption rates in stage 3, and (ii) that neither the amount of knowledge transfer (in stage 2) nor actual adoption (in stage 3) are affected by how the payments will be shared.  The underlying rational for the latter is that if parties can bargain, the initial allocation of the financial compensation does not affect actual outcomes (as predicted by the Coase theorem). "
