abstract: "In this experiment, we examine whether the acceptability of exploiting a tax loophole depends on how “clever” it is. The experiment involves two types of participants: taxpayers and spectators. Taxpayers are matched into groups of three and are supposed to pay a tax designed to equalize their incomes. However, they have the option to engage in a calculation task to reduce their tax rate at the expense of other participants. After the calculation task they have to report the number of correct calculations. Depending on the treatment, the calculation task contains different loopholes, which allows taxpayers to strongly lower their tax rate. Spectators judge whether exploiting the respective loophole is appropriate or not. They can decide whether to sanction workers who exploited the loophole. 

This experiment relates to experiment AEARCTR-0011828 (https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/11828). In contrast, we manipulate the cleverness of the loophole in this experiment."
