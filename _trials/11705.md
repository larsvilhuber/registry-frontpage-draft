abstract: "The RCT will randomize temporary H-2A visas to Mexican migrants. Recruits will receive work contracts of between 2-6 months to work in agricultural farms in the US. We will follow laborers who did and didn't receive the visa, alongside their households in Mexico, to understand the impact of migrating on their livelihoods and income. By following those who did and did not receive visas, we will measure whether providing short-term legal migration deters irregular migration and quantify whether income from seasonal migration is being used or can be invested in origin communities to alleviate poverty, improve livelihoods, and enhance educational opportunities. We also will understand the impact of migrating on political and civic attitudes; community cohesiveness, norms of social reciprocity; and experiences of violence and exploitation.

Data from a previously conducted pilot (n=100, run over 2022/2023) was used only to compute power tests for the current project.
