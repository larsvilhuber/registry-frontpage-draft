abstract: "In 2018, the New Zealand government promised to reduce the prison population by 30% within the next 15 years. This goal arose because of recent increases in the number of prisoners, and because New Zealand has one of the highest incarceration rates in the OECD. One way to reduce the prison population and increase the efficiency of the justice system is to increase the number of people who appear in court when released on Police bail. 

In this trial, the Behavioural Insights Team has partnered with New Zealand Police to test whether a behaviourally-informed new police bail notice can increase court attendance by defendants. The new notice draws on concepts from behavioural science to encourage behaviour change, including simplification, reciprocity and social norms. "
