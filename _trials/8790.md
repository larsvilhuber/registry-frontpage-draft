abstract: "The aim of this randomised field trial is to study the causal effect of three different SMS voting reminders on turnout of young voters in upcoming Finnish county elections. The turnout has been noticeably low among youth voters compared to older age groups in Finland and thus it is important to explore cost effective means to mobilise the youth. The target population of this intervention is from 18 to 29 years old individuals who are eligible to vote, living in municipalities with an electronic voting registry (i.e. the turnout is registered at the individual level) and having a cellular phone number. The sample consists of four different randomised groups; Control Group which does not receive a reminder, Neutral Treatment Group which receives a neutral reminder on election dates and urges to vote, Expressive Treatment Group which receives an expressive reminder about the right to vote and Instrumental Treatment Group which receives an informative reminder about a possibility to have an influence on the public service provision by voting. All treatment groups will receive an SMS before the advance voting period and another before the election day. Potential heterogeneous effects by age, geographical area, previous voting participation and socioeconomic status will be estimated."
