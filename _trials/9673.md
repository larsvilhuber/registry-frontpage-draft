abstract: "Parental decisions regarding education and occupation pathways are often predictive of children’s outcomes, leading to intergenerational persistence in labor market outcomes. We survey adolescents aged 14-17 as well as their parents to study the role of information and parental expectations for adolescents’ occupation choice. For that purpose, we first elicit information on parents’ occupations and their occupation recommendations for their adolescent child. We then inform a randomly selected subgroup of adolescent respondents about their parents’ answers to study the effect of information on adolescents’ occupation preferences. "
