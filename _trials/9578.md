abstract: "The study examines whether prior migration experience—that includes various social and economic interactions between migrants of the same nationality, albeit across different ethnic groups in the foreign country of employment, affects the return migrants’ preferences and beliefs in their home country about individuals of their own as well as of different ethnic groups. This project will use randomized controlled trials based on experiential priming to evaluate the changes in returnees’ in-group and out-group behaviors using different types of in-the-lab, incentivized economic decision-making games.
