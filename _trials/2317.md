abstract: "We study internal vs. external motivation with regard to helping behavior. Batson (1987, 1991) has formulated the “empathy-altruism hypothesis” (EAH). It claims that empathic concern felt for a person in need produces an altruistic motivation to relieve that need. However, research has neglected the motivational mechanisms whereby empathetic concern elicits help giving. For example, feeling empathetic concern for another person could potentially trigger external pressure to help others (e.g., adherence to social or cultural norms could be motivated by tangible rewards, punishments, guilt, or pressure from others), which in turn could cause helping behavior driven by external motives, rather than being due to an increased motivation to act in accordance with internal moral values. Using a comprehensive laboratory experiment, we test EAH. We experimentally prime empathy. Moreover, in contrast to previous studies, we provide subjects with an opportunity to only appear moral in the eyes of someone in need, without actually being so (hypocrisy case). If empathy causes an internal motivation to help, we should observe more helping behavior and no hypocrisy. However, if empathy merely triggers external motives to help, we would expect to see an increase in hypocrisy. The various benefits of helping behavior for the self will also be investigated; e.g., is acting hypocritically enough to reduce aversive arousal? Practical implications for organizations (e.g., team work) and markets (e.g., for health care) will be discussed.
