abstract: "The objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) delivered by local counselors, on the mental health and socio-economic empowerment of survivors of Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) who suffer Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), in North and South Kivu (DRC). The therapy is expected to reduce the symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety in SGBV survivors. In the medium-term, the therapy is expected to improve beneficiaries’ economics empowerment, self-efficacy and social functioning and participation. The therapy will be delivered by local counselors only, but following a ‘training of trainers’ approach. A first generation of counselors will be trained and supervised by clinical experts from the NGO Vivo International. These trained counselors will deliver a subsequent training to a new generation of counselors, who after a period of time with train a third generation of counselors. This proposed impact evaluation will answer the following research questions: 1) What is the impact of NET on survivors’ psychosocial wellbeing, economic empowerment and social functioning and participation?  2) Does the intervention have the same impact when implemented by each generation of counselors, trained by international or local facilitators? Do counselors become better over time?"
