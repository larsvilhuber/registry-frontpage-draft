abstract: "We measure couples’ divorce expectations and knowledge of divorce law using a new online panel of spouses in the US. We provide randomized information on divorce risks to two-thirds of couples. Half of those also receive information on the division of Individual Retirement Account and 401K upon divorce. We investigate the impact of the treatments on divorce expectations and knowledge of divorce laws, as well as on saving for retirement, retirement plans and Social Security expected claiming age, of both partners.
