abstract: "Wearing masks and regularly washing hands with soap and clean water are strategies recommended by the CDC and the WHO  to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.  These actions may be feasible in settings where social distancing measures are difficult to implement.  However, it is challenging for health authorities in low-income countries to share accurate, up-to-date information with local communities, and misinformation and mistrust can undermine compliance. We will partner with the Ministries of Health in Zambia and Kenya to deploy accurate and locally-appropriate text messages about how the coronavirus spreads and actions individuals can take to mitigate the spread, and about reducing stigma associated with infection or preventative actions.  We will leverage individualsâ€™ own networks to spread messages.  Recent evidence indicates that peers may have an advantage over third parties in communicating health information, but financial incentives may be necessary to overcome the time, monetary, and psychological costs of outreach.  Therefore, we will test the effect of SMS message dissemination by peers compared to from a central authority, with and without financial incentives, on behavioral change by the social contacts of cellphone users.
