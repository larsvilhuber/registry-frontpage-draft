abstract: "This project evaluates the effects of international educational migration, a novel approach to reducing global inequality by helping individuals from low-income countries to study and work in high-income countries. We partner with Malengo, an NGO that supports Ugandan students to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Germany. We conduct a randomized controlled trial, exploiting that Malengo randomizes admission among qualified applicants, and compare the outcomes of applicants who are selected by Malengo and those who are not, as well as their families and communities in Uganda. Here, we focus on short-term outcomes within the first three years of students’ arrival in Germany, i.e. before they complete their degrees and enter the labor market. We measure the effects of the intervention on objective and subjective wellbeing, cognitive skills, and aspirations of applicants and their social networks in Uganda."
