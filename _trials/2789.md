abstract: "In this study we experimentally evaluate an education program in the Salvadorean district Morazan that expands schooling by an additional 180 minutes per week. The program comprises three different interventions that target primary school children in grades 3 to 6: (1) addtional math lessons taught by contract teachers, (2) additional math lessons taught by contract teachers using the software "Khan Academy", and (3) additional math lessons based on the software "Khan Academy" supervised by technical staff (but not teachers).  This setup allows us to study the degree of complementarity/substitutability between computer-assisted learning software and pedagogically trained teachers. In particular, we appraise whether the (potential) impact on learning outcomes is primarily attributable to additional math classes or the use of computers, and further compare the cost-effectiveness of the three different versions of this school expansion program.
