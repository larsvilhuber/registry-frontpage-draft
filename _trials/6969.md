abstract: "The COVID-19 pandemic caused colleges and universities to offer many courses online. The United States Military Academy at West Point was no exception and each department was asked to find a way to teach classes at 50 percent capacity.  Per institutional and Army policy, West Point already randomly assigns cadets to course order, class hour, instructor, and class section.  The Economics Department decided have each instructor teach half of their course load online and the other half face to face.  Given West Point's previous policy on random assignment to class section, cadets were randomly assigned to either an online or face to face class.  Instructors used a uniform curriculum and all graded events were the same across the modality.  This experimental setting will allow us to control for instructor style and quality while assessing the efficacy of online learning."
