abstract: "We live in a society which values meritocracy, in which people are rewarded by their merit, rather than luck or other factors. Studies show that inequality is more acceptable to individuals when the source is considered as merit (Almas et al., 2020). We are interested in situations where the source of merit is unequal opportunity. Specifically, we investigate individualsâ€™ preference for redistribution when the source of inequality involves unequal opportunity. "
