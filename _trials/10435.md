abstract: "In this paper, we conduct a two-part survey to understand the role of misperceptions in determining willingness to pay for clean air. First, we conduct an incentive-compatible survey experiment to elicit individuals' understanding of environmental quality and how the current research frontier suggests these exposures map into measures of life expectancy.  Next, we use a follow-up survey experiment to explore the role of information provision in ameliorating both misperception on average, as well as differences in misperception between racial groups. Finally, we use a real-stakes exercise to test whether respondents' willingness to pay (WTP) for clean air changes when they update their beliefs about air pollution. "
