abstract: "The question how firms improve their productivity is of paramount policy im-
portance for every nation. To harness the benefits from the recent acceleration
of investment in digital technologies, firms must put in place appropriate man-
agement practices. In this paper, we aim to use a field experiment among
UK firms to causally identify the effect of information provision on the perfor-
mance management of a key digital asset - business websites - and the software
technologies used to build them. Specifically, we investigate the importance of
information gap in hindering technology adoption, performance and manage-
ment of digital technologies. For this end, we provide a randomly selected firm
with an information about own website performance, industry common and
best practice together with inputs of digital management and monitoring tools.
After that we assess if these change the adoption of web-based technologies,
and website performance. The information provision or encouragement design
will be carried out to randomly selected firms in the retail industry."
