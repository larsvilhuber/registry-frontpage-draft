abstract: "This study evaluates a low-cost intervention aimed at encouraging mothers and other caregivers to converse with their infants as a way of promoting language and brain development. In our study setting of Ghana, as in many developing countries, the practice of "infant-directed speech" is not common and its value for child development is not fully appreciated by parents. We developed a short (3-minute) animated video that encourages the viewer to talk to, sing to, and read to her babies, and to encourage family members to do so as well. A randomly selected subset of study participants are shown this video. Half of the treatment group is additionally given a calendar with images and messages from the video as a way to keep the message salient and to facilitate common knowledge in her household about these lessons. We will measure the impact of the interventions on child development and language skill approximately 4 years after the intervention."
