abstract: "I derive a simple and generally applicable theoretical model of choice bracketing from two behavioral axioms on top of expected utility. The first behavioral axiom establishes a direct link between narrow bracketing and correlation neglect. The second behavioral axiom identifies the reference point as the place where broad and narrow preferences are connected. The narrow bracketer is characterized by an inability to process changes from the reference point in different dimensions simultaneously. As a result, her trade-offs between dimensions are distorted. While she disregards interactions between actual outcomes, she appreciates these interactions mistakenly with respect to the reference point. Since the narrow bracketerâ€™s ability to think multidimensionally is preserved at the reference point, my model resolves the general incompatibility of narrow bracketing and budget balance. Furthermore, it allows me to isolate the effects of narrow bracketing in the absence of loss-aversion. Finally, the model reveals a connection between narrow bracketing and the use of budgeting heuristics. In addition to the theoretical contribution, I present the results of an experiment to test the predictions and underlying assumptions of my model."
