abstract: "Many public policies create (perceived) winners and losers, but there is little evidence on whether redistribution can support new political economy equilibria that raise aggregate welfare. We extend an experiment from Uganda that randomly distributed cash grants labeled as aid shared from the refugee response (AEARCTR-0005229) in Kenya. We test for impacts of the receipt of labeled aid on attitudes toward refugee hosting policies, relative to an unlabeled grant of the same value or no grant."
