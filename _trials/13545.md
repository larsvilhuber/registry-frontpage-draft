abstract: "Each year, Norway disburses reimbursements totaling around 665 millions dollar to its general practitioners (GPs). The system operates on a fee-for-service basis, predominately relying on trust. Under this system, GPs receive compensation determined by their fee utilization which ideally reflects their volume of health services. However, there is considerable variability in fee utilization, leading to diverse amounts of reimbursement being issued to GPs.
  
This study aims to investigate the extent to which GPs respond to information indicating that they are among the GPs receiving the highest reimbursements from HELFO. More specifically, we randomly assign municipalities into a treatment group and a comparison group, with approximately equal numbers of GPs in each group. 

It is expected that the results of this study will serve as a resourceful guidance for policymakers, to how responsive GPs are to information on their reimbursement claims compared to others in a cost-efficient channel. In addition, it will provide a reference regarding which GPs are the most responsive.
