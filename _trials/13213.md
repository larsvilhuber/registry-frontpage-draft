abstract: "Child sponsorship is a popular way of supporting children in low- and middle-income countries around the world. We study the impact of after-school child sponsorship on learning outcomes in the Philippines. For each the centers in our study, the child sponsorship organization identifies eligible children from grades 3-4, from which we will randomly select children for child sponsorship. We collect household and child demographics at baseline and further measure learning outcomes and supporting factors, including the child’s hope, food and health, investments in learning, and the child’s preferences. We will study the impact on learning outcomes, explore the extent to which the supporting factors may explain these impacts, and research heterogeneous effects along various relevant dimensions."
