abstract: "High upfront connection costs may limit demand for electrification in low-income settings, but such costs may only be one of multiple factors preventing households from connecting to electricity. Imperfect information about the benefits and costs of electrification, technical or behavioral savings constraints, the price of electricity postadoption, credit constraints for appliance investments, and low-quality service may all
pose barriers to electrification even when connection costs are low. Which barriers, either alone or in combination, are responsible for low electricity adoption?"
