abstract: "We investigate pay-what-you-want pricing determinants for visitors of an open-stage performing arts competition regarding the performersâ€™ rewards. Seeing performing arts as a mixed good with a private, as well as a public goods component, we want to identify different visitor types concerning their payment motivation. Our main factors of interest are public good valuation, reciprocal motives towards the artists, competitive preferences arising from the characteristics of the show, and gender effects."
