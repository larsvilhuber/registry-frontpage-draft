abstract: "An implication of loss aversion is that contracts written to reward agents with gains from effort will not produce the same effort as contracts that are otherwise equivalent but exact losses from the lack of effort. Given that a “losses contract” increases average effort, those who are loss averse should drive this increase. We run a laboratory experiment in which subjects are incentivized to complete a real-effort task. Subjects are treated with either a "gains" or "losses" frame. Using an independent measure of loss aversion, we focus on how loss averse subjects are differentially affected by this framing. "
