abstract: "In France, only 30% of 6th grade students iare expert readers, while 56% are slow readers and 14% have serious difficulties reading. In PISA 2012, reading comprehension is an issue for 18.9% of 15 year old students. Reading is key to success in school; however, in France, very little is done after 5th grade to improve reading skills because teachers are nor sensitized nor trained to these difficulties; struggling readers  are not even routinely spotted. We use a randomized experiment to investigate the impacts of reading workshops to develop fluency and comprehension skill on poor readersâ€™ outcomes. Every 6th grade student is tested at the beginning of the year to spot students with reading or comprehension difficulties and create the target group in every school. Only target students are then offered the workshops. We estimate impacts on reading skills of target students but also on achievements in other skills. We also estimate peer effects. "
