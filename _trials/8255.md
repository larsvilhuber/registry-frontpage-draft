abstract: "This study aims to investigate the effect of Douyin and its algorithms on usersâ€™ subjective well-being, cognitive skills, and opinion polarization. We carry out a randomized experiment among both the general population and university students in China. Participants in the two treatment groups were asked to either log out of their Douyin accounts (so that the algorithm stops working) or refrain from using Douyin completely. Outcomes are measured through online surveys, direct observation of Douyin accounts, and the screen time records of their smartphones."
