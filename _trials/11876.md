abstract: "We examine the impact of providing information on the income of the top 1% earners on attitudes towards this group. We focus on the income at the top derived from capital and labor, an aspect scarcely studied in previous literature. We conduct an online survey with 2,000 French adult respondents. We randomly expose two-thirds of the sample to our quantitative information on the income of top 1% earners in France. In addition, half of the respondents that received the quantitative information were randomly selected to receive complementary qualitative interpretations of the quantitative information."
