abstract: "“Moving Beyond Conditional Cash Transfers in the Dominican Republic” is an impact evaluation of a pilot program designed to train beneficiaries of Progresando con Solidaridad (ProSoli), the Dominican Republic’s conditional cash transfer (CCT) program, in the areas of financial literacy, entrepreneurship, and job skills. This program aims to increase beneficiaries’ basic financial knowledge and ability to access formal financial services through training modules including Budgeting, Savings, and Credit. Additionally, this program aims to train beneficiaries in both hard and soft employment-seeking skills (Job Skills module) or starting and maintaining micro businesses (Entrepreneurship module). The evaluation compares the impact of training groups led by peer or professional facilitators in their ability to increase the beneficiaries’ financial literacy, as well as the efficiency of the Job Skills and Entrepreneurship modules as labor market interventions. In particular, we are seeking to test whether there are heterogeneous returns for the two programs based on their demand for such training as determined in the baseline survey. Ultimately, the project is designed to advise the Dominican government as it develops a graduation strategy for the program’s beneficiaries."
