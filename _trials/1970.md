abstract: "The SEED schools merge both the "No Excuses" charter model (publicly funded schools outside of the local school districts) and a 5-day-a-week boarding program (intended to provide a nurturing experience outside of the classroom), providing America's only urban public boarding schools for low-income students. The purpose of SEED schools is to close the racial achievement gap, which can have ramifications on health, cognitive development and school achievement. 

Utilizing a random lottery when applications exceed the available admission slots, researchers report that attending a SEED school increases achievement by 0.211 standard deviation in reading and 0.229 standard deviation in math each year, although most of the impact is from female students. Students eligibile for free or reduced-price lunch have greater progress than those who are ineligible. Treatment effects for special education and non-special education students are not statistically different. "
