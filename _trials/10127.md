abstract: "Across South Asia, the brick manufacturing industry is dominated by inefficient, coal-burning kilns. Brick kilns are one of the largest emitters in the region. In Bangladesh, kilns contribute 17% of the country’s annual CO2 emissions and 11% of PM2.5. The pollution released by these kilns worsens local air quality, health and agricultural productivity, and global climate. Reducing these emissions could generate large social benefits. A properly constructed and operated zigzag kiln can reduce black carbon by 41%, CO2 by 21%, and PM2.5 by 80% – and strikingly, also increase kiln profitability. Yet the vast majority are incorrectly constructed and operated. Our preliminary work found that lack of knowledge regarding proper construction and operation and inattention to worker incentives undermine kiln operation. We propose a randomized intervention among kiln owners in Bangladesh that relaxes these barriers to improve kiln performance, reduce air pollution, and lower greenhouse gas emissions. "
