abstract: "A growing literature documents that nudges to students and their caregivers – from reminders to encouragement messages – can systematically improve educational outcomes. Having said that, when there is substantial heterogeneity in treatment effects, policy-makers have very little guidance on what is the best nudge for each student. In partnership with the São Paulo State Secretariat of Education (SEDUC-SP), in Brazil, this project implements an adaptive treatment protocol to assess heterogeneity in the responses to motivational nudges via text messages, and thereby to assign optimal messaging to students based on their observed characteristics. In a previous experiment (Bettinger et al., 2021) during school closures in the context of the pandemic, students were randomized to motivational nudges via text messages that targeted, specifically, (i) salience of school activities, or (ii) growth mindset, or (iii) beliefs about high returns to effort, or (iv) beliefs about low costs of effort, or (v) risk-taking, or (vi) future-orientation. We have built a machine learning model to predict student-level responses to each treatment arm – short-term effects on access to remote learning activities, and effects on attendance and grade by the end of the school year –, based on their individual characteristics. In this follow-up experiment, we use the ML-predicted ranking of treatments to assign each individual to their personally optimal messages. We evaluate impacts of being assigned the best treatment on average versus the personally optimal treatment on school attendance, grades and school dropouts."
