abstract: "We examine the effects of the Federal Reserve's communication of monetary policy on beliefs about future housing prices. On one hand, we analyze the impact of informational treatments regarding potential reductions in the federal funds rate and the mechanisms that link these changes to the housing market. On the other hand, we investigate how different communication formats (transcript, audio, and video) influence expectations about housing prices."
