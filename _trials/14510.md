abstract: "Even if it can be individually beneficial and rational to work more hours than others, the corresponding behaviour can lead to a collective increase in working hours without an increase in individual benefits. We investigate how the hours worked by colleagues affect working hours decisions. 

We conduct a survey experiment employing a between-subjects design with a representative sample of full- and part-time employees in Germany. Participants are randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups, with each group receiving a different hypothetical scenario. Depending on the treatment group, participants are informed that most of their colleagues work more, fewer or the same number of hours as they do. They are then asked how many hours a week they would like to work.

Our experimental design allows us to identify the causal effects of colleaguesâ€™ working hours on individual working hours decisions and to analyse heterogenous effects between socio-demographic groups and by attitudes.  "
