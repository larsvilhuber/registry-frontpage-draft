abstract: "The number of refugees and internally displaced people is increasing in the world. Building a good relationship between refugees and host communities is crucial for the welfare of both parties. This study investigates if formalizing land rental agreements is effective for reducing land disputes without decreasing the access to land for refugees. In doing so, we conduct a randomized control trial in the Rhino refugee camp and surrounding communities where refugees informally rent land from Ugandans but there are land disputes. The study contributes to the existing literature by providing rigorous empirical evidence. Findings will be beneficial to policymakers in understanding how to promote the economic independence of refugees by improving their access to land and to developing peaceful relationships between refugees and hosts. "
