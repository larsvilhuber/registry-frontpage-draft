abstract: "Since the pandemic, working a couple of days per week remotely from home has become the norm in many organizations. This transition, while granting newfound flexibility, also presents challenges. Employees may feel compelled to remain constantly connected to the workplace, particularly because digital communication tools enable virtual accessibility from anywhere. Research suggests a correlation between employee well-being and productivity regarding email and meeting practices. In this research, we conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) within a Belgian public administration to assess the impact of nudges (focusses) aimed at alleviating digital communication overload. The study seeks to assess how these nudges affect employee productivity and well-being. 

The intervention involves proposing to managers and employees a specific set of “best” organisational practices (nudges) intended to improve operational efficiency. These nudges primarily address the utilization of digital communication tools, such as email, scheduling meetings, and techniques for disengaging from work. The objective is to provide strategies that minimize unnecessary communication and meetings while optimizing the effectiveness of these communication channels. Further details regarding the practical application and execution of the intervention will be elucidated below. "
