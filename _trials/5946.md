abstract: "In the proposed study, we aim to distinguish the individual and combined influences of acute stress, failure and success on economic decision making using a behavioral online experiment. We propose to study a range of decisions that are commonly studied in economics and have been shown to be vulnerable to behavioral biases. Specifically, we will focus on the following elements of economic decisions: (1) intertemporal substitution, (2) risk taking, (3) altruistic behaviors and (4) effort choices."
