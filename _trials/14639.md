abstract: "Lead service lines (LSLs)  remain prevalent in the United States. Notably, the New York City Water System ranks third among public water systems regarding the number of LSLs.  This study will conduct an information provision experiment in NYC using an online survey. Both the treatment and control groups will answer questions about their beliefs regarding whether their homes have LSLs and their WTP for kitchen tap water lead concentration inspections before and after the information intervention. The treatment group will be provided with information on whether their building's service lines are made of lead. This study will investigate how receiving building-specific LSL information maintained by a government agency would affect oneâ€™s belief about LSL exposure and willingness to pay (WTP) for water lead inspection.
