abstract: "Generalised uptake of the supplier-managed charging of electric vehicles (EVs) is thought to be a major prerequisite for the wide-scale electrification of personal transport without costly investment in grid infrastructure. Yet this arrangement requires private individuals
to cede control of their domestic environment to an energy retailer, potentially hampering adoption. To empirically probe the malleability of private EV owners’ preferences around “handing over” control of their charging schedules, we will run a five-arm randomised field trial in 2024 involving 13,233 customers of a British energy supplier. These individuals will be offered randomly-assigned amounts of money to test how much it costs to switch them to a “smart” tariff combining supplier-managed EV charging with a static daily off-peak electricity price for their entire home.
