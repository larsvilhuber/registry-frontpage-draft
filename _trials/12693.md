abstract: "Studies have shown that excessive screen time is negatively associated with physical and mental health and academic performance. While most individuals have access to soft commitment devices designed to help regulate screen time, these tools are often underutilized. This study investigates the effect of a nudge on the adoption of commitment devices and subsequent changes in screen behavior, academic performance, and overall wellbeing of college students. We implement a randomized controlled trial at an undergraduate institution where a randomly selected group of first-year students receive emails that encourage the use of soft commitment devices. Using a combination of survey and administrative data, the study will assess the impact of the intervention. This study has the potential to inform policy by providing empirical evidence on the role of commitment devices and nudges in enhancing student outcomes in the digital age."
