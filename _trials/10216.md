abstract: "People may have negative emotions when being treated unfairly. In this project, we investigate whether different communication protocols can be effective in moderating such negative emotions in comparison to when such communication opportunities are not available. We test several scenarios where such negative emotions can be expressed through n human-human/ human-robot interactions. The evidence can shed light on the effectiveness of the widespread use of robot customer service."
