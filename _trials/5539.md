abstract: "Union workers make between 10 and 20% more in wages, and receive better non-wage benefits, than comparable non-union workers, a pattern that is remarkably stable across labor market contexts. This “union premium” is what unions can negotiate in collective bargaining agreements, yet the terms they negotiate depend heavily on their ability to mobilize their memberships to participate in “work actions” around contract negotiation time, in order to signal to employers a willingness and capacity to strike. We will conduct an experiment within the context of an approaching April 2020 contract negotiation covering  a large population of union workers in the United States.  Our project will (1) build and validate a predictive model for identifying shops and employees exhibiting untapped mobilizing potential for the union, and (2) randomize the distribution of this information about each building to union representatives in order to learn more about whether and how they are able to make use of it, including measuring contract mobilization outcomes.
