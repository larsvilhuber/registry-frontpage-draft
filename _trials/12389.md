abstract: "Although previous results in the literature show that workers' performance is not affected by Affirmative Action (AA, hereafter) policies, it is important to note that most of the previous experiments study one-shot interactions. One-shot studies present the limitation that participants lack the opportunity to learn over time. Consider, for instance, an AA policy benefiting female workers by enhancing their performance by a fixed increment. It is plausible that their male counterparts, who do not benefit from the policy, may not anticipate its true impact, which would lead to them initially exerting their best efforts. However, upon observing the results and experiencing the consequences, they might lose motivation and reduce their efforts. In such a scenario, what would be the overall effect of AA policies on performance? Would male workers be willing to move to a company that is not implementing this policy? This paper studies both the effect of AA on performance in the long-term scenario as well as the dynamics and endogenous group formation under AA policies."
