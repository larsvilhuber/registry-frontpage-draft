abstract: "In some cultures, the decision for young women to join the labor force comes with highly perceived social costs. With traditional gender roles being dominant in these contexts, young women carefully consider their marriage outcomes when making such high stakes decisions. In Saudi Arabia, we provide senior undergraduate women with information on men’s marriage preferences and how acceptable they find it for their wives to work. We try to understand the salience of this social norm and the effect of updating young women’s perceptions of what is socially acceptable to observe their attitudes and behaviors towards employment. We also aim to elicit these women’s job preferences through an incentivized choice experiment that provides them with real job vacancies and observe their employment outcomes."
