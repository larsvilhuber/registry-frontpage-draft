abstract: "Replication of experimental results is a focus of the recent literature. More broadly, it is important to know how experimental results vary when the context, or design, changes, that is, how heterogeneous the findings are. For example, how sensitive experimental results are to the demographics of the sample? How do they depend on the output measure used? How critical is the experimental protocol? We consider these questions in the context of a real effort task. We run variants of the same experimental treatments, varying one-by-one the demographic group considered, the task used, the measure of effort, and whether subjects know that the task is an experiment. We examine how much the experimental results change in response to these changes, compared to a pure replication."
