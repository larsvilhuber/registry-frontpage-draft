abstract: "Various positive psychological interventions have been investigated in different contexts to increase subjective well-being. The Crisis Ministry of Mercer County in Trenton, New Jersey provided a unique opportunity to study this form of intervention in a real world setting. In this paper, we outline a pre-analysis plan for a study at the Crisis Ministry’s food pantry to examine the effect of such an intervention on the participants. Participants in the treatment condition were asked to perform a task directly benefitting the Crisis Ministry that involved shopping for other clients who could not come to the Crisis Ministry. Participants in the control condition proceeded through the food pantry as usual. After shopping for food, a survey was administered to assess subjective well-being and information about the participant’s relationship with the Crisis Ministry. Here we outline the analysis of the effect of asking people to do a small favor on subjective well-being and the relationship between them and the requester."
