abstract: "This project evaluates a play-based intervention for Rohingya refugee children at Humanitarian Play Labs (HPL) in Bangladesh. Using a cluster RCT, we test whether HPL activities such as group play and art can improve social skills, social capital, mental health, physical, and cognitive development. The intervention runs for 12 weeks, offering a structured environment to develop key life skills for children aged 3-5. Our aim is to determine if these activities are a cost-effective, scalable way to build important skills among refugee children."
