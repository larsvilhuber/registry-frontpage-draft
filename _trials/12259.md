abstract: "Our study aims to address a critical challenge in contemporary society: the integration of low-income families into the rapidly growing digital society. We implement and evaluate a program designed to achieve this goal through three primary channels. Firstly, it ensures families' access to internet connectivity. Secondly, it provides them with digital devices, thus reducing economic barriers to technology adoption. Finally, it fosters the development of digital skills among family members, enabling them to effectively utilize available digital resources.
The program is implemented in an Italian city and involves approximately 900 participants, assigned to two treatment groups and a control group. We anticipate that implementing this intervention will promote increased online participation among treated families, enhancing their ability to access digital services, resources, and opportunities. We believe that sustainable digital access will encourage consistent and long-term engagement in the digital society, leading to improved quality of life for these families. This, in turn, should positively impact their job-seeking efforts, interactions with public services, and the education of their children."
