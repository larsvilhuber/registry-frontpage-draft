abstract: "Pneumonia and diarrhea continue to be primary causes of death among children under five, accounting for 30% of child mortality in Kenya alone. Research has demonstrated that handwashing with soap prevents pneumonia and diarrhea, but lack of soap provisions and limited piped water infrastructure makes handwashing practices difficult. To make the process of handwashing more convenient, Innovations for Poverty Action has redesigned an existing tippy-tap handwashing system to create a more functional, durable, and innovative handwashing system. The result is a water-efficient, soap-frugal handwashing station that is portable and adaptable to multiple settings. The innovative soap foam dispenser conserves soap by dispensing tactile foam and the water tap is easy to use and conserves water.

This study will assess household willingness to pay for the redesigned handwashing system in peri-urban communities in Kisumu, Kenya. Using a take-it-or-leave-it (TIOLI) approach with randomized offer prices, the study seeks to understand the potential market value of the handwashing stations. Additionally, usage and maintenance of the handwashing stations will be evaluated. "
