abstract: "This study consists of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to study whether appeals based on religious values can influence support for military aid to Ukraine in the presence of a competing economic cue. The influence of the religious values appeal is studied both independently and in combination with appeals based on international norms and security interests."
