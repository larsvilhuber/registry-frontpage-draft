abstract: "This study seeks to identify the role of affect in eliciting racially chauvinistic behavior on the Ultimatum Game (Güth et al., 1982). Existing studies show that some people, when in the UG’s receiver role, are more sensitive to unfair offers when these offers come from women or
racial minorities. We would utilize ultimatum offers from racially and ethnically diverse proposers to assess whether men in a non-WEIRD country behave similarly to those in the U.S., and, if so, whether certain affective primes impact their choices. Kuk (2019) used the
“economic insecurity” priming developed by Mani, Mullainathan, Shafir, and Zhao (2013) to elicit increased ethnocentrism among all participants and racial resentment among a subset, and we would use similar prompts to evaluate whether participants’ game play depends on
their “financial feelings.” Survey data from the same subjects may help explain greater or lesser tendencies toward chauvinistic behavior both in the control condition and when experiencing negative affect. We would also assess whether positive affect could ameliorate the behavior of people who might otherwise display racially chauvinistic play as the responder in the UG.
