abstract: "A vast literature in economics has considered the question of how firms set prices, and a growing literature has demonstrated how real people differ systematically from theoretical consumers. In this project, we ask how real consumers in an experimental setting respond to firms' prices. We focus on a specific pricing strategy, bundling of multiple goods, which has been shown to be theoretically optimal in a wide variety of settings (Chu et al., 2011; Eckalbar, 2010) but that may result in long, complex menus of prices that are difficult for consumers to digest. We aim to study (1) whether these complex menus drive consumers to make sub-optimal choices, and (2) how those real choices might change optimal firm behavior. We also test the impacts of two firm strategies that affect the complexity of the choice problem that consumers face: unexpected price shocks and information costs. We will quantify how these strategies may cause consumers to differentially deviate from an optimal choice, and test whether these may have lingering spillover effects on future decisions. We study these questions using a combination of simulated firm behavior with results from a lab experiment with students in the BRITE Lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison."
