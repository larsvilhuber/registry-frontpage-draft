abstract: "This study aims at estimating the impact of information letters on the uptake of Payments for Environmental Services (PES) by farmers in Northern France. PES are subsidies compensating farmers for the adoption of green practices. The European Union Common Agricultural Policy (EU CAP) is home to the largest PES program in the world. PES programs are voluntary and thus their efficiency strongly depends on farmers being informed about the existence of the PES. In this project, we sent letters to eligible farmers (located near zones where PES are available) informing them of their eligibility, of the type of program available to them (practices subsidized and subsidy amount) and providing them with the contact information to caseworkers in charge of helping them with their application. We also varied the content of the letter, adding testimonies of farmers already benefiting from PES and the ease of response by adding easy to use pre-stamped return letters. Finally, we test for the existence of a social multiplier in the numbers of letters sent by varying the proportion of farmers in a given commune receiving the letter.
