abstract: "In this experiment, we seek to understand the effects of temperature on productivity and cognitive effects under different piece-rate wage regimes in rural forest dwelling communities in Indonesia. The objective of this study is to (1) understand how ambient temperature affects core body temperature and subsequently productivity, (2) examine how incentives affect that relationship, and (3) test the cognitive impacts of the temperature, incentive, and environment relationship. Participants were asked to conduct a repetitive, generalizable task for 90 minutes while wearing a variety of sensors that measured their movement, heart rate, and core body temperatures. A separate set of sensors also collected objective data on environmental conditions (e.g., relative humidity, Heat Index/Humidex, wet bulb and globe temperature,  dry bulb temperature).  Participants are assigned to one of four conditions from a 2x2 factorial design. The two factors are the activity setting (open area vs. forested area) and the incentive type (standard pay vs. high pay [two times standard pay]). We answer (1) by using minute by minute variation in environmental conditions and core body temperature and its impact on productivity (and breaks). For questions (2) and (3) we will employ a 2x2 factorial design. This trial is being registered after the completion of the study but before the investigators have had any access to the data."
