abstract: "In this study, we conduct a randomized controlled trial to examine the effect of social interactions on prosociality and team performance. University students are paired and divided into two groups: one engages in a structured social interaction, while the other does not. We aim to assess how these interactions influence the level of prosociality between team members, specifically looking at the gap in prosociality levels within each team.
Following the interaction, all teams participate in a cooperative task designed to evaluate their collective performance. This experiment seeks to provide insights into how social connections within teams can enhance collaboration and task success, with a particular focus on the dynamics of prosocial behavior among team members."
