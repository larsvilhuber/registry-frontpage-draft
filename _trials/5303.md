abstract: "In a laboratory experiment, we examine whether ex-ante cash payments as compared to ex-post cash payments affect productivity under a loss contract. In particular, we aim at investigating whether loss contracts induce higher effort provision if participants receive their payment in cash before working on a real-effort task then if participants receive the cash payment after working on the real-effort task.
