abstract: "Objective: To investigate the short-term effects of lumbar Kinesio taping
on pain intensity and disability in women with pregnancy-related low back
pain.
Design: A randomized controlled clinical trial.
Setting: Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinic.
Participants: A total of 65 women with pregnancy-related low back pain
were randomly allocated into either Kinesio taping (n=33) or control
(n=32) groups.
Intervention: The intervention group was treated with paracetamol plus
Kinesio taping, while the control group received merely paracetamol.
Kinesio taping was applied in the lumbar flexion position, and four I bands
were used for five days. Two band was attached horizontally, with space
correction technique. The remaining two bands, one on each side of the
lumbar spine, were placed vertically, with inhibition technique.
Main outcome measures: Worst pain and disability were assessed at
baseline and at five days follow-up. The low back pain intensity was
measured on a 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS), and the Roland Morris
Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) were used for evaluation of disability.
Results: Pain intensity and RMDQ scores improved significantly in both
groups at fifth days compared with baseline. Considering the degree of
treatment effect, the Kinesio taping group was significantly superior than
the control group in all the outcome measures (for all P<0.001).
Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that Kinesio taping can be
used as a complementary treatment method to achieve effective control of
pregnancy-related low back pain."
