abstract: "Time and other-regarding, distributional preferences are fundamental for individual and collective decision-making and are therefore affecting economic outcomes such as consumption choices, human capital formation and labor market outcomes. Empirical evidence supports the view that these preferences are formed early in life and shaped both within the family and through interaction with peers and close social environments. This project proposes a closer look at the formation of an individual (patience) and a social (otherregarding) preference at an early age of 12-13 years. By measuring preferences at parental, class and friendship level, we explore the role of the close environment in the formation of the child’s attitudes and link them to school outcomes. While both preferences are fundamental for later-life outcomes, we expect differences in peer effects due to their more or less social nature. Using the gender dimension of the close environment we can uncover potential pathways of gender-specific preference formation. To sum up the project aims to address the following main research questions:
• What is the role of parents and peers in the formation of children’s patience and distributional preferences? How does the social environment relate to gender-specific formation?
• Do children sort into preference networks? How do patience and other-regarding preferences in the social network affect child outcomes?
• Are there differences between the individual (patience) and social (other-regarding) preferences?
