abstract: "This project unfolds in four steps. First, we will test the hypothesis that cooking with LPG (stoves and fuel) is viewed as desirable by Ghanaians but is associated with an expensive lifestyle. Second, we will compare survey respondentsâ€™ beliefs about LPG prices with true market prices in their home regions. This comparison gives us the direction and size of possible price information failures in this market. Our third step is to correlate price beliefs with individual and household observable characteristics. This will allow us to learn about key determinants of price perceptions for LPG. Fourth, we will use an experimental design to learn whether and how individuals update their price beliefs upon receiving information about LPG consumption in specific locations. This last piece will teach us about whether and how individuals learn from others in the context of cooking technologies. Results may allow us to think about cost-effective interventions aimed at addressing an information failure in the Ghanaian LPG market."
