abstract: "In this study, we will evaluate the effects of nudge messages to promote early evacuation before heavy rains occur. To examine the effects, we are going to conduct two online questionnaire RCT surveys. In the first survey, we will provide nudge messages to promote early evacuation and ask the willingness to evacuate under a hypothetical heavy rain situation. We are going to conduct follow-up survey two month later and investigate the long-term effects of messages and changes in disaster preparedness behaviors. Moreover, we are going to investigate the heterogeneity of the effects due to an occupation. This survey will give us an insight into what kinds of messages are effective for promoting evacuation and how the effects changes according to an occupation. "
