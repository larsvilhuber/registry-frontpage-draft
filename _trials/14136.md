abstract: "In this study, I investigate the role of social networks and biases in access to opportunities at a university setting, where such opportunities require third-party referrals, such as nominations and recommendations. I focus on university students as candidates and faculty members as referrers. Through a field experiment, I explore how these networks influence the request and receipt of referrals, potentially perpetuating biases that disadvantage certain groups in reactive help settings.

In the experiments, I inform students that they are offered an opportunity based on both their demographics and academic merit, requiring them to seek support from a faculty member to access the opportunity. I experimentally vary the information students disclose when requesting helpâ€”either focusing solely on academic merit (control condition) or including demographics. This variation allows me to evaluate how the type of information affects students' likelihood of seeking help, their choice of faculty members, and the likelihood of receiving assistance.

I conduct the study in two waves, one with only high merit student. The other with only low merit students. In each wave I use the same treatment variations.

This study complements a previous study on proactive help conducted in 2022, where faculty members where invited to nominate students to the same combined opportunity, access to an international training program plus participating in the lottery for a valuable prize. Data from the previous experiment allows me to identify proactive helpers, those who chose to make a referral in the first study. This consistency enables me to examine the relationship between proactive and reactive help. Specifically, I investigate whether faculty members who initiate help in the proactive experiment are also those whom students seek out in the reactive experiments.

The findings from these experiments will provide insights into the presence and extent of biases in referral processes and the effectiveness of awareness interventions in mitigating these biases. I aim to inform strategies for enhancing access to opportunities for underrepresented groups by increasing awareness of potential biases."
