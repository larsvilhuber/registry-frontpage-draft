abstract: "Previous experimental research has shown that engineering models for predicting the returns to investment in energy efficiency overestimate potential savings. We conduct an experimental evaluation of energy efficiency programs by conducting a 75,000-household randomized field experiment under the Home Performance with Energy Star program in Baltimore, Maryland. We test both the cost-effectiveness of the program, as well as several marketing strategies used to influence customersâ€™ decisions on energy efficiency. "
