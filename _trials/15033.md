abstract: "This paper examines the causal impact of self-chosen performance, learning, and behavioral goals on student motivation and academic performance in a college Microeconomics course. Using a randomized controlled trial, students were assigned to one of four groups: a control group with no specific goals, or treatment groups that self-select their own performance, learning, or behavioral goals. We find that self-chosen goals enhance academic outcomes compared to a control group, with learning and behavioral goals yielding significant effects. Performance goals drive higher achievement through increased effort, learning goals facilitate deeper engagement, and behavioral goals promote consistent productive habitsã€‚"
