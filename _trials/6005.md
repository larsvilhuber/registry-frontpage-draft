abstract: "We propose to conduct a randomized evaluation of a texting intervention to notify parents when their children miss school in the Province of Mendoza, Argentina. The province already has an online platform to which teachers regularly upload attendance information. We plan to leverage this platform to send weekly text messages to parents of students in public primary schools."
