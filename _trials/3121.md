abstract: "This is a re-registry (after data collection and analysis) to accompany our study, which was pre-regiistered at the OSF in November 2017.

Situations where one gives up own material payoff in order to increase someone else's material payoff are ubiquitous. In experimental economics, they are modeled as ‘dictator games’ and have been analyzed in great depth. What has gone unnoticed is that there are many games that are being studied under the label 'dictator game' in the laboratory, and that these game differ critically with respect to whether the underlying context is such that one player only gives and another player only receives, or whether players give and take at the same time. These two protocols come with crucially different (Nash) equilibrium predictions, even if players are allowed to have substantially pro-social preferences. Across the experimental literature, there has been a shift from the former –‘non-interactive’– dictator game implementation to the latter –‘interactive’– dictator game implementation. In this study, we will therefore implement dictator games using both protocols to improve our understanding of how these different protocols affect giving decisions."
