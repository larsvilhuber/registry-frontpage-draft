abstract: "This project encompasses two experiments being conducted as part of projects funded by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) in Cambodia, attempting to find ways to use information and communication technologies to improve the delivery of agricultural extension.  The project is being conducted in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) in Cambodia. A major challenge for many countries today is to find a way to appropriately and cost effectively support smallholder farmers given constraints on available resources with which to do so. Farmers often need technical advice, but it is not necessarily either cost effective for governments to provide it, nor is it necessarily feasible for governments to provide all farmers with extension.  Farmers by definition are spatially disperse, making it difficult to design effective extension systems from a public sector perspective.  Consequently, many governments are trying to get the private sector involved in disseminating messages, but years of priming have led farmers to place little private value on these services; in other words, farmers are used to getting whatever extension they get for free, and it is difficult to convince them they should pay for extension as a result.

New technologies provide potentially useful ways to disseminate extension messages to farmers. This project incorporates two such technologies, one within the PADEE (Project for Agricultural Development and Economic Empowerment) project and one within the ASPIRE project (Agricultural Services Program for Innovations, Resilience and Extension).  Within PADEE, we test the introduction of ePADEE, a specialized software for extension workers to provide them with information about seed choices, fertilizer application, and plant disease control. ePADEE includes a module to perform individual plot soil tests to provide personalized recommendations based on each farmers’ needs. The software’s content was developed by MAFF’s specialists based on Cambodia’s local agricultural conditions. Within ASPIRE, we test a system of direct phone calls to farmers.  We describe both below.

As part of the PADEE project, Grameen Intel collaborated with PADEE to develop what was termed ePADEE. To implement it, a small group of mobile support technicians (MSTs) were provided with tablets loaded with ePADEE and the software was tested in a small pilot by two NGOs (the SNV Netherlands Development Organization and International Development Enterprises - IDE) throughout 2015. Testing of ePADEE allowed MAFF and Grameen Intel to ensure that extension workers were able to use the software and that the information provided was locally relevant. During the testing phase, ePADEE was restricted to provide advice related to rice (the largest staple crop in Cambodia). 

Our project will test the impact of financial incentives and ICT (available through the ePADEE and tablets) on extension workers’ performance within the PADEE  projects in Cambodia.

Within the second project, ASPIRE, the government planned to distribute tablets to community extension workers (CEWs) in all areas, negating the possibility of randomizing ePADEE, which is just one of the tools made available on the tablets. Instead, IFPRI in collaboration with MAFF and CDRI developed a number of short messages about rice, chicken raising, and vegetables to send a set of short extension messages through direct mass calls.  Text messages were also considered, but many farmers do not have phones that support Khmer script.  To sign up farmers, CDRI conducted a baseline survey among farmers both within and outside farmer groups within a set of 72 communities that are part of the ASPIRE target area.  The team randomized the 72 communities into 4 groups of 18: a “basic calls group”; an “enhanced calls group”, which is receiving calls more regularly; an “enhanced calls plus” group, which is receiving calls both inside and well outside the farmer group, and a control group, which is just receiving ASPIRE as usual. 

More than 90 percent of Cambodian households now have access to at least one cell phone. But it is not at all clear that farmers would be receptive to any sort of message coming to their phones; further, individuals often change numbers in rural areas to take advantage of discounts or cheaper plans. As a result, it might be difficult to target farmers over a long period of time.  In the pilot described below, farmers were linked to the crops being promoted by their farmer groups and received a screening call to ask whether they were interested in participating; we included all farmer group farmers in call lists regardless of interest in the calls, but we can disaggregate findings by interest level.
