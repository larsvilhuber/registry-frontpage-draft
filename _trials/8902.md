abstract: "The goal of this study is to provide accurate information on COVID-19 vaccination to a large number of people. Since COVID-19 vaccines became available in France in early 2021, rates of vaccination have increased rapidly but have reached a point where the binding constraint is no longer the supply of vaccines, but rather demand from people to get vaccinated. On September 15, 2021, 70% of the population was fully vaccinated and 75% had received at least one dose. While these numbers are good relative to other countries, they likely fall short of the vaccination rates required to prevent the development and spread of new variants of the virus. The study will also include a few videos on the importance of flu vaccination.

In this study, we plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial with France-based adults initially contacted through Facebook. The aim of the study is to distribute videos recorded by health care professionals along with other resources that encourage COVID-19 and flu vaccination to a large sample of Facebook users. We will test the most effective ways to maximize diffusion of vaccine-related content and increase vaccination rates.
