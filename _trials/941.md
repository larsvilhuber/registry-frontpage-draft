abstract: "The primary goal of this evaluation is to test alternative implementation strategies for the performance contracts in the Kenyan Judiciary. This impact evaluation will test three of such measures: (i) information that illustrates to performance contract signatories how they are performing against their targets and compared to peers; and (ii) complementing the information with calls from management for supervisory accountability, and (iii) sharing this information with court user committees as a means of local accountability. Variations in these complementary measures will be the heart of the impact evaluation."
