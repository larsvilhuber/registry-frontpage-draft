abstract: "The ecological transition of the economy that is advocated to contrast climate change must be supported by the creation, in parallel, of green jobs and workers capable and willing to work for them. For this purpose, public and private actors from the green sectors need to define incentive-compatible tools so as to attract skilled workers. While the extant literature is rich in studies approaching the restructuring of greener sectors, there is a lack of knowledge about the behavioural motivations underlying job applications for a job in a green or polluting sector. What is most striking is the potential difference in short- and long-term financial incentives gave the opposite trends of the two sectors, as well as the potential inducing mechanism of social pressure for preferring green jobs."
