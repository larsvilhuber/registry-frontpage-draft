abstract: "Conducting a randomized experiment, we examine whether discrimination exists among teachers against Roma minority students in Hungary. Our target population consists of teachers who teach Hungarian grammar and literature or mathematics in the 5th-8th grades of Hungarian primary schools. The experiment will be carried out online. We will contact every Hungarian primary school with an invitation letter sent to the schools’ central e-mail address that is publicly available. The first 200 mathematics and 200 Hungarian and grammar school teachers who are willing to participate can take part in the experiment. Teachers will be asked to evaluate six mathematics/Hungarian tests and recommend a secondary school track to the fictive student. Students’ names on the tests will be randomized (Roma male, Roma female, non-Roma male, non-Roma female names). We hypothesize that tests with Roma names receive lower evaluations and track recommendations on average than tests with non-Roma names. We test our hypotheses estimating linear regression models with teacher and test fixed effects. We preregister the analysis plan before having any endline data."
