abstract: "Internet-based surveys provide data to social research especially when administrative sources are difficult to obtain or does not exist. In this context it is valuable to study effective ways to attract survey participants to enter and stay panel online survey. In this study, we experimentally test whether particular dimensions of the incentive to re-enter existing Internet-based panel survey conducted during pandemic lock-down in Poland can keep panel subjects in the survey. We find that providing a reward ex ante and lottery with a high award (but the same expected value as certain prize) increase response rate among survey participants. The long-lasting effect is observed only with an ex ante payment."
