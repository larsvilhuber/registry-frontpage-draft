abstract: "The experimental design will be used to infer the impacts of a financial education course integrated into the math curriculum for 9th and 10th grade students, as well as active learning methodologies trainings for their teachers. The program targets students from disadvantaged families, seeking to make school more attractive and effective for them. 

The intervention spans the biennium 2021 and 2022 and comprises three treatment arms: a single dose of the program for students and teachers (in the 9th grade); a second dose for students in the 10th grade, and a second for 9th grade math teachers. The evaluation seeks to account for the impacts of the program over students cognitive and non-cognitive development, teachers’ practices and motivation, their financial knowledge and behaviour, their attachment to school, besides the use of a new instrument to measure students’ readiness for the labor market.
