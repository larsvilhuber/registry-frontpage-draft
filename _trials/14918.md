abstract: "We use a survey approach to estimate the exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) at the firm level. We randomly assign firms to different vignettes presenting different hypothetical scenarios for the euro exchange rate. Firms are then asked to provide own-price growth expectations over two different horizons in response to these scenarios, directly eliciting their ERPT. We subsequently investigate whether firms are operationally or financially hedged against exchange rate movements. "
