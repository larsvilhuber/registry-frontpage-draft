abstract: "Performance targets indexed to indicators of economic activities have the advantage of adapting to the changing winds of the economy. However, they impose uncertainty on the economic agents that may result in lower effort. With our RCT we want to analyze whether sales team members exert more effort when they have a tangible target expressed as an absolute number of units to be sold versus a target expressed as percentage of an activity indicator? Further, how the effort exerted varies as a function of the ex-ante uncertainty in the economic activity? How different are the ex-ante number of units sold targets from the ex-post target number calculated as a function of the activity indicator?"
