abstract: "We study the impact of cash transfers and a psychological video intervention, individually and in combination, on womenâ€™s empowerment and intimate partner violence. The sample includes over 3000 married women from around 170 villages in the Siaya Country in Western Kenya. In addition to evaluating the impact of the interventions, we also consider possible mechanisms for the impact."
