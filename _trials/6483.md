abstract: "While behavioural economics has considerably profited from incorporating insights from other social scientific fields into economics, it has mostly applied each finding separately. For example, loss aversion, altruism, or guilt aversion have greatly enriched the set of behavioural measures in improving decision-making modelling. However, a major structural driver of behaviour, namely basic human values have so far been neglected. Yet, both the theory of human values (Schwartz 1992) and behavioural economics share the goal of uncovering the fundamental drivers of what people ultimately want. This study aims to close this gap by relating human values to the most prominent behavioural economic concepts with two samples from Germany and Poland. "
