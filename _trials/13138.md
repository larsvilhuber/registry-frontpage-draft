abstract: "For short-term workers facing uncertain output, hourly wage contracts provide implicit insurance compared to self-employment or piece-rate pay. But like any insurance product, these contracts are prone to market distortions through moral hazard and adverse selection. Using a model of wage contracts under asymmetric information, I show how these distortions can be identified as potential outcomes in a marginal-treatment-effects framework. I apply this framework to a field experiment in which data-entry workers are offered a choice between a randomized hourly wage and a standardized piece rate. Using experimental wage offers as an instrument for hourly wage take-up identifies moral hazard, while comparisons between piece-rate workers who declined different wage offers identifies adverse selection.
