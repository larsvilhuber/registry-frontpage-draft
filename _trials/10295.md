abstract: "In low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs), social networks facilitate critical risk-sharing between households facing shocks that, otherwise, would result in severe deprivation. However, LMIC social networks often fail to quickly diffuse information about beneficial new technologies, possibly slowing growth and development.  In this paper, I develop a model where a householdâ€™s payoff from a new technology is jointly determined by the level of informal insurance and communication provided by the social network. When the technology is riskier than the outside option, reliance on informal insurance discourages communication about the technology. I test this model through an experiment in rural Pakistan.
