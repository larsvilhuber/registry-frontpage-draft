abstract: "MDRC, in partnership with MEF Associates and Abt Associates, is conducting an evaluation of The Journey, as part of broader study called Building Evidence on Employment Strategies (BEES). BEES is funded by Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation within the Administration for Children and Families at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Journey, originally a pilot program run by the Franklin County Child Support Enforcement Agency (FCCSEA) in Ohio, provides a package of employment supports, structured parenting classes, and individualized case management to noncustodial parents with new child support cases. The goal of The Journey is to achieve a better and more productive start of the relationship with noncustodial parents, to increase their rates of employment, improve their engagement with children, and improve their adherence to child support orders through early intervention.  Under a BEES evaluation, both FCCSEA and the Stark County Child Support Enforcement Division (SCCSED) will implement The Journey, and the BEES evaluation will test an enhanced version of Franklin County’s pilot services in both Franklin and Stark counties. Individuals eligible for and interested in receiving The Journey services are assigned at random to a treatment group, who will be offered the full Journey services, including employment services combined with parenting services, enhanced child support and other services, or to a control group, who would receive “business as usual” services with the child support agency and have access to other services in the community. The goal is to enroll 1,400 people in the study across the two counties (1,020 in Franklin County and 380 in Stark County). In each county, sample members will have an equal chance (50%) of being randomly assigned to the program or the control group. The main outcomes to be measured are total earnings during the 12-month follow-up period, and number of quarters employed during the 12-month follow-up period. "
