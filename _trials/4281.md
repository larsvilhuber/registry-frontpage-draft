abstract: "In many workplaces, newly-employed workers are usually assigned to teams where most teammates are more senior to them. As a result, new workers may be relatively well-informed about the current performance of senior workers, but not so much about the past performance of senior workers and the current performance of other new workers. This differential visibility of co-workers' performance may affect the well-being, productivity, and attrition of new workers through its interaction with two behavioral phenomena. First, new workers may set their reference point at the high level of the current performance of the senior workers, resulting in high stress and high attrition. Second, new workers may misattribute the current high performance of senior workers to their innate ability rather than the outcome of learning, and hence have a dim outlook about their own future performance. 

In a field experiment at a leading multi-national spa chain, we study how information about co-workers' performance affects workers' well-being, productivity, and attrition. First, we study how workers' outlook about their future performance and their reference points for performance comparison depend on their knowledge about their co-workers' current and past performance. Then, we provide workers with information about their co-workers' performance. In Treatment 1 (T1), we provide information to each worker about the current performance of co-workers with similar work experience. In Treatment 2 (T2), we provide information to each worker about the performance trajectory of their senior co-workers. We measure the treatment effects on the workers' beliefs about their own future productivity, reference points, stress levels, productivity, attrition, and pro-social behaviors."
