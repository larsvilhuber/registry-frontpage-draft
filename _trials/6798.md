abstract: "We study how social networks may shape adoption of preventive health behavior. Our multiple surveys - an in-person household census and subsequent phone surveys - cover the period before and during COVID-19 pandemic from all 16,058 households in 135 villages/sub-villages in Bangladesh. We collect detailed information on local social network, COVID-19 preventive behavior and knowledge, demography, and other socio-economic variables. In the experimental part of this study, we provide preventive health messages to randomly selected 20% households in our sample in May-June 2020. These health messages target specific preventive behaviors, following households' self-reported adoption of best practices (e.g., using mask, hand washing, social distancing). About five months later while the pandemic is still ongoing, we collect information on adoption of preventive behavior and COVID-19 awareness from households."
