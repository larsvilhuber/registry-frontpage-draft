abstract: "We conducted a randomized experiment in which we provided Wikipedia access to secondary school students at boarding schools in Malawi. Malawi is one of the least developed countries in the world, yet internet is widely available on mobile phones. While many young Malawians have occasional or regular access to a mobile phone, access to a smart phone and the internet remain unaffordable. This is likely to change in the near future, in Malawi and across the developed world. The effects of a large increase in access to information for young African students is an important policy question. Investigating the impact of Wikipedia in particular is interesting for both theoretical and policy reasons. First, restricting internet access to Wikipedia allows us to isolate the impact of an information shock from the other resources available through internet access. Second, as a matter of education policy, schools may choose to provide students with some of the informational benefits of the internet without allowing unrestricted access. Wikipedia is a free and valuable resource, and may prove to be a useful educational tool. We will measure the impact of Wikipedia access on education outcomes, aspirations, internet literacy, time use, general knowledge and social network position. "
