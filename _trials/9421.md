abstract: "Measuring the size of the LGBT+ population, homophobia and discriminatory practices in surveys is difficult. Understanding the extent of these identities and behaviors is important for policy design and implementation. We run an intervention using an item count technique to recover both the (closer to the) true prevalence of these identities and behaviors and an implicit measure of the cost of revealing this information socially. Our setting is large metropolitan areas in Mexico. We then relate these experimental measures with labor market choices, such as participating in the informal economy.  "
