abstract: "Workers periodically worry about issues unrelated to the job, such as dwelling on whether the front door is locked or stress induced from other factors. Similarly, workers are routinely under pressure to meet their job’s demands, increasing productivity to meet deadlines, or achieve performance goals. Previous work has studied the response to incentives under both these two sources of stress experienced by the workforce in isolation, characterizing non-work-related stressors as distractions and work-related pressures as performance under pressure.  There is no research that we are aware of directly testing whether these two roots of stress differentially affect the way in which workers respond to incentives. The main objective of this study is to investigate whether job related, and non-job-related sources of cognitive load produce different effects on performance under the lens of utility theory. Specifically, using a modified real effort task first introduced in Gächter et al. (2016), we propose and implement a design to determine whether exogenous increases in cognitive load caused by distractions unrelated to the real effort payments or payments contingent upon the real effort task differentially affect the performance of workers when facing different incentive structures."
