abstract: "It is often assumed that naturalization has positive impacts for immigrants, but this has been difficult to test given the self-selection into naturalization. We will examine the effects of naturalization through an experimental study which randomly offered vouchers to low-income immigrants in New York that would pay their naturalization fee. We will use follow-up surveys and administrative data linkages to measure the effect that American citizenship has had on their financial outcomes. "
