abstract: "During information evenings about the upcoming choice of tracks at the end of 6th grade, we will provide attendants with information on how strongly girls and boys adjust their aspirations for vocational trainings in the STEM fields when these aspirations are to be discussed with parents rather than staying confidential. We will analyze whether the provision of this information affects eventual track choices. "
