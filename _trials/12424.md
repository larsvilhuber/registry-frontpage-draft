abstract: "This study will investigate the phenomenon of strategic incompetence in the context of gendered differences in the allocation of low-promotability tasks in the workplace. Using a series of online experiments, it will explore whether individuals strategically feign incompetence to avoid being asked to perform undesirable tasks again. Our findings will contribute to understanding gender dynamics in task allocation in the workplace."
