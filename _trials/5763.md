abstract: "Attitudes toward risk are one of the primitive concepts in economics. Moreover, measuring risk preferences is critical for economic analysis and policy prescriptions alike. Therefore, it is only natural that economists have developed a variety of experimental methodologies. However, “risk elicitation is a risky business” (Friedman et al., 2014) with some of the current established methods being hard to understand for participants, difficulty to implement, or not able to capture attitudes well enough. In this study we propose an improved, simple but effective method to elicit on-line individuals’ attitudes toward risk, SERA. This new method sits between a fixed design (i.e., Multiple Price List, Holt & Laury, 2002) and a dynamically optimal design (i.e., BOARD, Wang, Filiba, & Camerer 2019) using an adaptive three questions procedure. Hence, it strikes a compromise among quality of the data, simplicity of implementation (for experimenters), and easiness to understand (for participants).
In an empirical validation we perform a within-subjects comparison of SERA with the most commonly used risk elicitation procedures (the MPL and the investment task) using as a metric of judgement the proportion of out-of-sample correctly predicted choices."
