abstract: "This randomized experiment takes place on a social media platform in Pakistan called Baang.  It measures the impact of two treatments that fully control access to misinformation relative to a more standard ex-post approach to controlling misinformation.  In the treatment versions of the platform, moderation is ex-ante: all user-generated posts are reviewed by a moderator before being posted on the platform. In the remove treatment, user content that includes COVID-19 misinformation is simply never posted to the platform, while in the sunshine treatment, user content that contains COVID-19 misinformation is posted along with a rebuttal that debunks the post.  The experiment focuses on misinformation regarding COVID-19 and is combined with an intervention to disseminate official information about the pandemic on the platform. "
