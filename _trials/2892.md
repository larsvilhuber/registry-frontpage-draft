abstract: "We study how the introduction of a new microcredit loan with greater repayment flexibility affects firm growth among existing borrowers, and how it changes the pool of borrowers who select into borrowing. BRAC, one of the largest microfinance institutions in the world, decided to pilot a new loan product with greater repayment flexibility in Bangladesh. The new, flexible loan contract allows borrowers with good credit history to delay 2 repayments (out of 12 monthly repayments) within their loan cycle. Using a cluster-randomized design, we evaluate the effect of the flexible loan contract on eligible borrowersâ€™ investment and borrowing decisions and firm growth. Moreover, we track the borrowing decisions of a representative sample of microenterprises in treatment and control areas to study which types of firms become microfinance clients after the introduction of the new loan.
