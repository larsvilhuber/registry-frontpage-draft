abstract: "We partner with an online dating service to study the market outcomes and consumer behaviors under different recommender systems. There are two treatment groups: The first treatment group receives the recommendation based on the mate preference estimated from the existing database. The second treatment group receives the recommendation based on the same preference estimation, adjusting for the matching cost implied by a structural matching model. The control group receives a randomized recommendation. We measure several outcomes: consumer satisfactory (from a survey after the experimental period), click-through rate, response rate, time to find a dating partner, cross-sectional distribution of the number of likes, degree, and centrality of the dating bipartite graph."
