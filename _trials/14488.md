abstract: "This randomized controlled trial (RCT) examines the effectiveness of remedial classes in enhancing educational outcomes and promoting equity among children in Tanzania. The intervention is designed to address learning disparities, particularly among students in underserved communities, by providing targeted support to those at risk of falling behind. The study leverages a rigorous experimental design to assess the impact of remedial classes on both immediate academic outcomes and. We want to quantify the causal effects of remedial classes on student outcomes. These outcomes include general academic performance (based on the intensive margin) measured through standardized test scores, grade completion rates, and attendance records. By stratifying the analysis by gender, the study could in principle investigate how remedial education impacts boys and girls differently, providing insights into gender-specific barriers and opportunities in educational attainment. The main outcomes will include i) improvements in academic performance (standardized test scores, grades), ii) progression to the next grade level, and iii) school attendance rates associated with gender-specific effects on learning outcomes, iv) teacher performance metrics, and v) students’ self-reported confidence and motivation to continue their education. The program incorporates a robust teacher training component to enhance the effectiveness of remedial instruction. This aspect of the study will explore how teacher preparedness and instructional quality mediate the relationship between the intervention and student outcomes. The RCT will monitor participants throughout the 2025/2026 academic year to assess the long-term impact of remedial classes on students' academic trajectories and overall educational outcomes."
