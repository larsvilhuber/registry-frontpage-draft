abstract: "This report evaluates the impact of the Cash Transfer for Education pilot in Garissa, Kenya. The pilot took place over 18 months, 2013-2014, and involved giving conditional and unconditional cash transfers as a means of increasing primary school enrolment and attendance. 

The results from this pilot rely on randomised allocation to treatment that was conducted with 4000 participants in 31 villages. Each participant was assigned to either the unconditional cash transfer treatment (UCT), conditional cash transfer treatment (CCT), or control group. "
