abstract: "    This study explores the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to mitigate medical overuse by examining the decision-making processes of physicians in a controlled experimental setting. Medical overuse, characterized by unnecessary interventions that may harm patients and inflate healthcare costs, is a significant issue in both developed and developing healthcare systems. By integrating AI tools that offer evidence-based recommendations, this research aims to understand the extent to which AI can influence physician behavior and reduce overtreatment.
    
    Our experimental design involves a lab-in-the-field setting within a medical school, where we manipulate both monetary incentives and the availability of AI assistance across different groups of medical students. We employ a two-by-two factorial design to assess how these variables impact the rates of overtreatment and the accuracy of clinical decisions. The studyâ€™s primary outcomes include the frequency of overtreatment, diagnosis accuracy rates, and the adoption rate of AI advice.
    
    The findings are expected to contribute to the broader discourse on how AI can be lever-aged to enhance clinical decision-making and reduce inefficiencies in medical practices. By providing empirical evidence on the effects of AI interventions in reducing overtreatment, this study could inform policymakers and healthcare administrators about the merits of incorporating AI technologies in healthcare settings, potentially leading to improved healthcare efficiency and patient safety.
