abstract: "How do small firms navigate tax compliance in low enforcement environments? Using the population of administrative tax declarations by Rwandan firms from 2008 to 2016 to evaluate a 2012 reform in Rwanda that introduced an income tax exemption threshold, we find that firms previously below the exemption threshold on average double the amount of taxable income reported to the tax authority and increase the amount of tax paid by 60 percent in the post-reform period. Potential mechanisms behind this response include overestimation of the likelihood of experiencing an audit, the influence of peers on the declaration decision, and changes in the actual likelihood of experiencing enforcement resulting from the choices of local peers. In order to identify which of these mechanisms explain the observed behavior, we will conduct a survey of 1,000 taxpayers to collect detailed information on the tax compliance decisions of small firms and assess their responses to information through an experimental approach. The survey will measure how the characteristics of firms differ across amounts of reported taxable income in order to understand the responses observed in the quasi-experimental analysis. The survey will contain an information experiment, the design of which is detailed in the pre-analysis plan. The experiment addresses the potential mechanisms by assessing how taxpayers respond to information about (1) the likelihood of experiencing an audit or review from the tax authority and (2) the declaration choices of local peers. Outcomes will be assessed through a survey experiment approach and by observing the actual post-treatment tax declarations made by firms in the sample."
