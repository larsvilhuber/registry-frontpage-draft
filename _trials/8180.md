abstract: "Field experiment designed to investigate the role of dynamic norms for donation decisions in a natural setting. In collaboration with a large charitable organization, we test the hypothesis that giving social information by making dynamic norms salient has the potential to increase charitable giving. In a regular donation upgrade request, we vary whether and how information about how many others have increased their donations in the past already. At the same time, we vary whether subjects can choose between relatively low or relatively high upgrade options.

In a second trail, we conduct a two further experiments to better understand effects that we observed in the first trail. The experiments are in particular concerned with the effects of the ask string."
