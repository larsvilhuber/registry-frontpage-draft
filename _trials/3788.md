abstract: "This project investigates whether Filipino migrant domestic workers are treated better by their employers in Saudi Arabia and Hong Kong after an intervention that suggested them to bring a small gift and to show a family photo to their prospective employer during their first meeting. The first part of this study (originally registered with the funding agency 3ie) found these positive effects (also in a revealed-preference way). In the second part, we use an incentivized online experiment with representative samples of upper- and middle-income populations of Saudi Arabia and Hong Kong. Participants ("employers") can redistribute money between themselves and Filipinas. The games allow us to study both pro- and anti-social behavior. Before their decisions, participating Filipinas either reveal 1) no additional information about themselves, 2) they show photos of their families, 3) they send a small online gift, or 4) both. We also examine if the effect differs when the gift or photo are presented during the first round, or during a second round, two weeks later. To separate mechanisms, we also introduce a default allocation of money in the redistribution games. In the second round, we also measure changes in implicit associations using a single-target Implicit Association Test."
