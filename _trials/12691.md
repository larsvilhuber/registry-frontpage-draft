abstract: "The randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted from 2013 to 2014 in rural middle schools located in Shaanxi Province, China. Out of a total of 32 schools, one class each from grade seven and eight were randomly selected. All students within the sampled classes underwent an eye examination, and those identified as myopic were further refracted. The refractionists were from a nonproÔ¨Åtorganization called OneSight, a foundation that aims to provide access to quality vision care and eyewear in underserved communities worldwide. The refractionists
were all participating in a volunteer project that was working in the three sample counties. Among the 32 schools, 16 were randomly chosen as treatment schools where free eyeglasses were manufactured and provided to all myopic students. The baseline survey took place in September 2013, while the endline survey was conducted in May 2014. This study was led by a team consisting of scholars from Shaanxi Normal University and Stanford University under the team of REAP. The project was designed to investigate the impact of addressing students' vision problems on their academic performance, thereby yielding implications for policy regarding student vision issues."
