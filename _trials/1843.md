abstract: "The Bangladeshi garment industry was instrumental in expanding womenâ€™s employment opportunities in the urban job market. However, the positions available to women at factories remain mostly limited to those at the machine-operator level. Building on findings from Macchiavello et al (2015) we implement a shorter and less costly training program for female operators that focuses on soft skills. Randomizing individual workers into three groups, we seek to determine whether soft skills training or hard skills training is a more effective and efficient means to promoting female advancement. We also investigate the effects of and interactions with a cross-cut training for higher-level factory management, which provides managers with tools for standardized worker evaluations and demonstrates the effectiveness of female supervision. In February 2017, Hannah Uckat added an additional component to the trial, which investigates the role of and the effects on women's bargaining power in the household.
