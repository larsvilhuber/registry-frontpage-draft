abstract: "Firms are typically modeled as profit-maximizing agents. In low-income countries, many firms are subject to social relationships that affect profit-maximizing behavior. In this project I study the cost of competition between small, urban firms by measuring their minimum profit needed to publicly undercut competitors. By subsidizing firms to post below-equilibrium prices, I additionally study how firms respond when competitors sell at below equilibrium prices."
