abstract: "Much of the population in rural sub-Saharan African relies of firewood or charcoal to prepare food. Population pressure is speeding the rate of deforestation, raising the monetary and opportunity costs of cooking meals. We use a field experiment in Zambia to investigate the impact of solar cook stoves on the money households spend on charcoal and the time allocated to collecting firewood. Additionally, we examine changes in diet that result from the reduction in the cost of meal preparation."
