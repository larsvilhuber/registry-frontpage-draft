abstract: "In many developing countries, gender inequalities begin at a young age and influence individuals’ long-term trajectories. In particular, social norms can lead to girls dropping out of school, marrying, and having children early in life. Women with less education may then experience reduced empowerment and limited job opportunities. In turn, this can create a cycle of gender inequality: participating less in the labor force may increase economic dependence on men, and strengthen the social norms that contribute to women dropping out of school. Can encouraging girls to stay in school and to develop skills improve their future economic and social trajectories? In order to answer these questions, we evaluate the impact of secondary school scholarships for girls on skill development, empowerment, and job opportunities."
