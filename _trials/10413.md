abstract: "This project examines the beliefs individuals hold about how willing others are to receive feedback on their performance. In particular, in a previous study, we explored whether individuals seek or avoid receiving feedback on their performance on a cognitive test or their performance on job interview questions. In this follow-up study, we attempt to understand whether a new set of individuals holds accurate beliefs about the willingness to seek or avoid feedback of these previous study participants. "
