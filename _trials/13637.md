abstract: "Income inequalities have risen starkly across the globe in recent decades. Yet societies worldwide are increasingly organized along ethno-religious lines rather than economic ones. This puzzle is particularly true of Lebanon, where ethno-religious voting blocs continue to uphold a failed state. To explore this, we will first conduct a representative survey of 3,300 Lebanese living in Greater Beirut to document the relationship between incorrect beliefs about out-groups and support for sectarianism — the formal and informal organization of life around religious sect. We then conduct an experiment to test the effects of correcting the misperception that out-group individuals “are better off than us”  — on political preferences and participation. We randomly assign respondents to a video treatment stressing the relatively low levels of inequality between religious groups, or control. We test whether correcting beliefs can bolster social cohesion, shape policy preferences on redistribution, tax morale, and the acceptability of voting for politicians from other religions, and boost real-world measures of political and civic participation."
