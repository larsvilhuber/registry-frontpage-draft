abstract: "This project aims to estimate consumersâ€™ willingness to pay for mobile money in Tanzania. We randomize households across 29 regions in Tanzania into a treatment group, where they are eligible to receive either a 50% or 100% discount on some mobile money transactions for 8 weeks, or a control group, where they do not receive any discounts. The treatment group is further divided into 4 sub-treatments where discounts are eligible for either (1) all Cash-Out (CO) transactions, (2) all Person-Person (P2P) transactions, (3) all Person-Merchant (P2M) transactions, or (4) all CO, P2P and P2M transactions. We will visit households 3-4 weeks after the discounts end, to measure transaction use outcomes both during and after the discounts are active.  "
