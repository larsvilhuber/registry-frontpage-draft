abstract: "The South African Department of Basic Education is investigating ways to strengthen the teaching and learning in Foundation Phase through the Early Grade Reading Studies (EGRS). The first study took place in the North West province and focused on the teaching of reading in home language. The second study is taking place in Mpumalanga  and evaluates two different interventions, both aimed at improving early grade reading in English as First Additional Language (EFAL) to prepare learners better for the transition from home language to English as the language of instruction, which occurs in Grade 4. Both interventions provide teachers with a structured learning programme aligned to the national curriculum, and additional reading resources. However, the two programmes differ with respect to the modality of training and support: (i) the traditional face-to-face format through central training and regular school-based coaching; (ii) a combination of face-to-face training and an ICT component that includes electronic tablets and cell phone messaging to the teacher. The cost-effectiveness of these two programmes will be measured relative to each other and relative to a control group of schools. The interventions will be evaluated by testing learners entering Grade 1 at the start of 2017 and following the same learners through to the end of Grade 3 in 2019, testing the learners yearly at the end of each year. To evaluate the sustainability of the benefits of the interventions, the same learners will be assessed in Grade 4, a year after the interventions have been concluded.
