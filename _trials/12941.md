abstract: "City—and national—governments are under pressure to mitigate carbon emissions, improve air quality and public health, ease traffic gridlock, and fund public transit (Salvo and Wong, 2023). A successful energy transition implies attracting urban commuters away from private cars and into public transport. The challenge is huge because car use—whether owning or ride-hailing a car—is aspirational, convenient, and increasingly affordable relative to rising incomes, including for the 4 billion urbanizing commuters in the “rising middle classes” (Gertler et al., 2016; Oswald et al., 2020). 

By conducting a Randomized Control Trial with 300 students, this project is the first step to test the hypothesis that a mix of pro-environmental messaging, carbon scoring, and gamification-based rewards encourages public transit (Salvo and Lee, 2023; see the external link below). Researchers from the National University of Singapore are collaborating with economists from Singapore's urban transport agency, the Land Transit Authority, on this research.
