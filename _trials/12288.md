abstract: "This research project examines the impacts of integrating refugees into a national public works and livelihoods program. It leverages a nationwide large-scale randomized controlled trial conducted among 22,500 households across six refugee camps and neighboring areas in Ethiopia. The program under investigation, called Refugee and Host Integration through the Safety Net (RHISN), offers remunerated participation in public works (e.g. building roads, irrigation ditches, cleaning public spaces, etc.), business trainings and coaching, and a USD 600 business grant to refugee and host beneficiaries to promote economic livelihoods and socio-economic integration between refugees and hosts through joint work in integrated teams. We will assess i) whether the program improves beneficiariesâ€™ well-being (including economic, social, and psychological well-being), ii) the productivity and social cohesion effects of inter-group contact by mixing refugees and hosts in public works groups, and iv) the economic and social spillover effects of the program. This is one of the first Sub-Saharan efforts to integrate refugees into a national social protection system. Our findings will inform the ongoing shift of policy in the region from a primarily camp-based humanitarian approach to one based on promoting socio-economic integration.
