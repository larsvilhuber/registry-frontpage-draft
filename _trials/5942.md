abstract: "In this project, we investigate the extent to which people manipulate their views on morality in a self-serving way. We implement an online experiment among a representative sample of adults aged between 18 and 69 years in Germany. Each subject is randomly assigned to one of four experimental groups, and completes four consecutive stages. In stage 1 of treatment 1, the subject divides a fixed monetary endowment between herself and a charity which supports children with low educational success. In stage 2, the subject is asked whether she considers it a moral obligation to support children with low educational success. In stage 3, we elicit the subject’s belief about other respondents’ moral assessment and incentivize correct beliefs. In stage 4, we again elicit moral assessment as in stage 2, and pay an incentive if the respondent gives the modal answer among all other respondents. Treatment 2 is identical except for the fact that the allocation task in stage 1 is between other survey participants (instead of the subject herself) and the charity. By comparing responses in stages 2 to 4 between treatments 1 and 2, we assess whether moral assessments and beliefs change to justify previous selfish choices. Treatment 3 is identical to treatment 1 except that there is no allocation decision in stage 1. Instead, subjects are simply informed that they receive an extra payment. Comparing stages 2 to 4 between treatment 1 and treatment 3 allows us to test for endowment effects. Treatment 4 is identical to treatment 1, except that the allocation task is performed in stage 4 instead of stage 1. Comparing allocation decisions between treatment 1 and 4 allow us to investigate the extent to which allocation decisions are affected by preceding (moral) introspection. At the same time, responses in stages 1 to 3 of treatment 3 provide a benchmark for moral assessments which is uncontaminated by preceding allocation decisions."
