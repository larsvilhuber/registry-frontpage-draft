abstract: "This experiment studies the effect of macroeconomic expectations on the business decisions of small enterprises. More precisely, we study: (i) whether small businesses form accurate expectations about important macroeconomic indicators such as the foreign exchange rate and inflation rate; and (ii) how changes in those macroeconomic expectations affect the actual day-to-day business decisions, such as price-setting or inventory holdings, among others. We designed a survey that allows us to measure the expectations of firms selling their products through one large online retailer in India. Firms that participate in the survey are assigned to a treatment or to a control group. The treatment group receives information about one macroeconomic indicator; either an official forecast of the expected inflation in the next 12 months or the forecasted exchange rate. The control group does not receive any information. We use the rich administrative records of the firm to measure the effects of the information on actual, real-time, pricing decisions."
