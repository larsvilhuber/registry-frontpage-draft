abstract: "Educational and career choices are based on beliefs about subsequent career outcomes but these beliefs may be incorrect. In this research we document that U.S. STEM doctoral students hold excessively optimistic beliefs about the share of students eventually becoming tenure-track faculty in research-intensive institutions. We then conduct a field experiment providing  STEM doctoral students accurate information on historical placement rates to estimate whether this information impacts their preferences for different careers (academia versus industry) and their actual career choices."
