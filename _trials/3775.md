abstract: "This pre-analysis plan outlines the hypotheses to be tested in the evaluation of an initiative against Muslim radicalization done by the main Muslim authority in Mozambique. This initiative will be conducted in Mosques in the Province of Cabo Delgado at a time where a series of deadly attacks in the region was being attributed to Muslim radicals. In response to these events, the Mozambican Islamic Council (CISLAMO) decided to test two different types of interventions to dissuade the Muslim youth to join the radicals. A religious sensitization meeting where the authorities discuss the Muslim Law and Tradition to show how the radicals are not defending the Muslim Faith. And a professional training session that helps to increase youth employability. In this study we conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of these different programs."
