abstract: "Forest restoration is crucial for mitigating climate change, improving local environmental conditions, and supporting farmers’ livelihoods. Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) can directly incentivize rural property owners to join reforestation efforts, yet the evidence to guide their design is thin. PES systems can suffer from high adoption barriers, low additionality effects, and contract compliance challenges. In this pilot, we plan to evaluate the impact of different producer outreach strategies for enrollment in a Brazilian forest restoration PES program. Enrollment is a key bottleneck for scaling up forest restoration in this region. As part of this assessment, we also examine motivations for enrollment and participation costs participation during the first year of the program. This will also provide crucial information for designing a full-scale randomized evaluation of forest restoration."
