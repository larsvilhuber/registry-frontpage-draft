abstract: "Stereotypes and social norms influence females' academic self-concept, pushing them to choose humanities rather than science. Female scientists may serve as role models to lower the prevalence of the general stereotype associating quantitative science with men. Recent studies have shown that female science professors and teachers increase females' enrollment rates in scientific majors (e.g., Carrell et al, 2010). In this study, we investigate the effect of a one hour, one off intervention by an external female scientist in high-school classrooms. The scientist shares her own experience and provides information about scientific careers and the underrepresentation of women in science. Classes selected for the intervention are randomly drawn within each of the high schools that volunteered to participate in the program. The intervention will take place in about one hundred high schools of the Paris region and will target approximately 6,000 students in their first year of high school (Seconde generale et technologique, equivalent of 10th grade in the US) and approximately 3,000 final-year students preparing the scientific baccalaureate (Terminale scientifique, equivalent of 12th grade in the US).

The main goal of the study is to investigate if a short intervention by an external role model can effectively change students' stereotyped perceptions and educational choices. Such an intervention can easily be scaled up, should it prove effective, whereas it is not always possible to use female teachers as role models to reduce the gender gap in science."
