abstract: "This study should provide insight into the impact party cues have on the public opinion on the amount of action to be taken to protect the environment and climate during the current COVID-19 crisis. In particular, the effects of cues from one or multiple parties as well as the mechanisms behind these effects are supposed to be analyzed employing two online survey experiments."
