abstract: "The Gini coefficient and the concentration index for socio-economic health inequality are two widely used measures of inequality in their respective fields. Both indices implicitly make the value judgment that individuals that are equally far away from the median are weighted equally when the index is calculated. The generalized Gini coefficient (Donaldson and Weymark, 1980) and the extended concentration index (Wagstaff, 2002) both generalize the standard indices so that the value judgment enters as a separable variable that can be adjusted e.g. giving relatively higher weight to the disadvantaged part of the distribution. The aim of our study is to use surveys to elicit this inequality aversion parameter with respect to income inequality and socio-economic inequality in health. Assuming that health is increasing in income, we first elicit the ν parameter of the concentration index of socio-economic health inequality. Since the value of the ν parameter is dependent on the societies used to elicit it, we estimate ν based on two types of societies, one with high average health and relatively little variance and one with lower average health and relatively large variance. We then elicit the δ parameter of the generalized Gini coefficient (S-Gini) of income inequality. Both the ν and the δ parameters capture the relative weight respondents put on different income groups (socio-economic groups) when assessing the level of inequality in a society. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to empirically assess the δ and ν inequality aversion parameters using individual data. We also estimate the inequality aversion parameter ε of the Atkinson inequality index for inequalities in income and health, again assuming that health is increasing in income. While δ and ν measures preferences for how to weight income groups when the average health/income is constant, ε measures preferences for how to weight income groups by eliciting willingness to exchange efficiency in health/income for equity in health/income.
