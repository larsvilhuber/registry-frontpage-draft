abstract: "The Duke Global Health Institute will work with Catholic Relief Services (CRS) to lead the design and implementation of a cluster-randomized controlled trial in Uganda to assess the impact of the Child-Optimized Financial Education (COFE) curriculum among participants of selected Savings and Internal Lending Communities (SILC) groups. CRS has focused its outreach efforts on caregivers and households of orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) through the Sustainable Outcomes for Children and Youth (SOCY) program in central and western Uganda. Hence, there is a mix of SOCY and non-SOCY participants within and across SILC groups.  All study participants are in SILC groups but only SILC groups randomized to the intervention receive the COFE curriculum. The main research questions include: 

1) Does participation in COFE + SILC groups increase the likelihood that caregivers pay for required education expenses of all the school-age children under the caregivers’ care to stay in school vs. participation in SILC only groups?

2) Does participation in COFE + SILC increase the likelihood that caregivers pay for health-related expenses of all the children under the caregivers’ care (who have a health need) vs. participation in SILC alone? 

3) Does participation in COFE + SILC increase caregivers’ financial self-efficacy vs. participation in SILC alone?
