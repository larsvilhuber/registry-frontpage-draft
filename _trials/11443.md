abstract: "Armed conflicts cause tremendous human suffering, particularly for displaced populations who lose their homes and sources of livelihood. Armed conflicts have resulted in 48 million people being displaced, either as refugees or Internally Displace People (IDP). Displaced populations are particularly vulnerable to psychological disorders because of war-related traumas before departure and adverse experiences during the transition and after arrival in a new community. Despite their dire need, displaced populations have limited access to mental health services. For this pilot study, around 600 Afghan refugees will be recruited in Istanbul, Turkey, and randomly assigned to (1) a manualized Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) training that teaches coping and emotion regulation skills, (2) Islamic-based CBT delivered by religious clerics, (3) sermons delivered by religious clerics without CBT structure, or (4) a waiting control condition. We will study the impact of the intervention on refugees' psychological well-being and prosociality."
