abstract: "This document describes the analysis plan for a randomized laboratory experiment examining the effects of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) on psychological and physiological states. Our study expects to include 60 subjects from the informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. Respondents are randomly assigned to either a treatment or control condition of the TSST, for either one single day or seven consecutive days. This plan outlines the design of the study, the outcomes of interest, and the econometric approach."
