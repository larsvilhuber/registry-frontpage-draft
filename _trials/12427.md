abstract: "In this study, we examine motivations underlying where students decide to attend college. We examine the effect of selectivity, diversity, and aid packages, on student willingness to pay (WTP) for college and likelihood of matriculation, using a robust set of demographic information. We use a discrete choice experiment (DCE) programmed in Qualtrics where 400 respondents (consisting of first-year college students) choose between three randomly selected hypothetical institutions over 13 menus (including 2 attention check menus), in collaboration with an online survey company, College Pulse."
