abstract: "Private land conservation is critical in generating environmental services for society. Protecting and enhancing environmental services from private land through land use change and adaptation often impose considerable opportunity costs on landowners. Over the last decades, agri-environmental schemes have been widely used as a policy instrument to compensate landowners financially for the costs related to land conservation. However, the performance of such incentive-based schemes relies heavily on landowners’ willingness to participate. An RCT will be conducted by mailing a survey package to 7,299 eligible individuals who own forest land in the Kumakogen municipality in Japan. This RCT addresses two questions: (1) Does a nudge intervention facilitate landowners’ participation in an easement contract? (2) How severe can non-response bias be in nudge interventions through a mailed solicitation?"
