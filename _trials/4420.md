abstract: "This study examines the impact of information intervention on paternity leave use. In Finland, fathers are entitled to paternity leave of 54 working days. Fathers can use 1 to 18 days at the same time as the child's mother is on leave. The remaining days be can used after the parental leave but not later than the child reaches the age of two. More than half of fathers do no use the remaining days of their leave. In this trial, we test whether an information intervention has an impact and send fathers a letter that provides information on paternity leave. "
