abstract: "Research has shown that tax refunds are usually spent on consumption instead of being saved or invested. In an email experiment, we inform (prospective) customers of a roboadvisor about the deadline for filing the 2022 tax return, promote a special partner offer to file it, and nudge them to invest the refund with the roboadvisor. To increase the motivation of filing and investing the return against the control group, we test a graphical nudge in the otherwise identical treatment group. The graph illustrates the expected wealth accumulation when investing the average tax return each year for the average working life in one of the roboadvisor's portfolios. We expect more filings, manual transfers, and assets under management in the treatment group, because customers have a higher motivation to file and invest the tax return. Moreover, we expect more prospective customers to become customers of the roboadvisor in the treatment group, because of a higher motivation to use the tax return to start investing with the roboadvisor."
