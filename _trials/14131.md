abstract: "Jobseekers across countries and cohorts value amenities. However, in developing countries, many job descriptions are sparse and thus may not include the full range of amenities that firms offer. In the first part of this project, I partnered with a large Indian job board to analyze whether a lack of amenities on job descriptions forms an information friction. Conducting a data collection exercise and survey experiment with first-time jobseekers, we found that firms have amenities that jobseekers value, but do not include them on job descriptions. In the second part of the project (this experiment), I partner with the job board to examine one reason why valued amenities are missing from job descriptions: firms may not fully be aware of jobseekers’ preferences. We test whether informing recruiters of jobseekers’ preferences can lead them to update their job descriptions with valued amenities. "
