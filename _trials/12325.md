abstract: "We run a RCT to test the impact of information interventions on reducing household carbon footprints. A link to access the personalized report on household carbon footprints is sent via a text message. The impact of the following three elements in reducing carbon footprints are tested: (i) the detailed structure of household carbon footprints, (ii) peer comparison, and (iii) personalized feedback. individuals who participated in the baseline survey (N=3,000) are randomized into four groups, with the control group receiving only the carbon footprint amount, treatment group 1 receiving the amount and structure, treatment group 2 the amount and structure plus peer comparison, and treatment group 3 personalized feedback in addition. We calculate carbon footprints based on itemized expenditures on different activites, which are self-reported in online surveys. We would exploit variations within individuals (before and after the information intervention) and between treatment arms to analyze the impact of different information interventions on reducing household carbon footprints.
