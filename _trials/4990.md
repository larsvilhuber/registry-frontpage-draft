abstract: "Parental involvement is increasingly used to improve student performance at school, yet, it remains unclear if the diverging background of parents could reinforce disparities among students. This study provides causal evidence on the effects on student performance of information provision to parents in a financial education course in which parents are involved by means of a homework assignment. Based on a randomised controlled trial with three different treatment groups and in total 1,253 students in 8th and 9th grade in Flanders, we identify the effects of a classroom intervention without parental involvement, parental involvement through homework and the provision of information to parents. In addition, effects of an interactive family task on students’ and parents’ learning are evaluated."
