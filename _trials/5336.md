abstract: "The project investigates how to increase the long-term savings of cocoa farmers in Ghana, with the aim of improving food security. While cocoa farmers are very eager to open savings accounts, it turns out to be difficult for them to continue savings for old age. We study whether long-term savings can be increased by showing a pension documentary (Video), and/or handing out a savings calendar. We hypothesize that the pension documentary can increase viewersâ€™ savings by raising their aspirations, and savings are important for future food security. In this field experiment, we work with about 750 cocoa farmers in 2 Ghanaian cocoa cooperatives, and randomly assign them to two treatment groups and one control group.
