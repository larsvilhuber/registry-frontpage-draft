abstract: "The result that markets erode morals (Falk & Szech, 2013) has recently been challenged (for instance by Bartling et al., 2019). Recent experiments on norm erosion restrict market participants to trade at most one unit. This choice might limit the extent to which market forces facilitate selfish behavior and outcomes. In this project, we study markets with multi-unit trading. We establish whether the moral concerns of traders are reflected in market outcomes to the degree that is theoretically predicted and whether there is norm erosion in markets by comparing valuations of a charity donation in individual decision-making to the valuations in markets with single and multi-unit trading."
