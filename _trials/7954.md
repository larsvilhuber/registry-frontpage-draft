abstract: "We are partnering with Rising Academy Network (RAN) in Liberia to evaluate the impact of an accelerated reading program on learning outcomes of overage students in early childhood education (ECE) classrooms. In Liberia, a majority of primary and pre-primary students are older than the mandated age for their grade.  To mitigate over-age enrollment in ECE classrooms, RAN has developed the FasterReading curriculum to prepare ECE students for enrollment into age-appropriate grades. We are conducting a randomized controlled trial of this new curriculum from November 2021 to July 2022. 74 RAN-managed government schools with ECE classrooms were randomized to the FasterReading curriculum (37 schools) or to the standard curriculum (37 schools). A sample of students in treatment and control schools will be assessed on foundational literacy skills at baseline and at endline. The results of this research will be used by RAN to inform scale-up decisions, and will be shared with government partners to inform ECE programming across the region. "
