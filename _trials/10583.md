abstract: "Over the last half century empirical economics has gone through a paradigm shift. The credibility revolution, with its careful attention to causality, has presented itself as a new paradigm for taking the "con out of econometrics”.  We hope to study causal effects of a paradigm shift in the social sciences on practitioners–policymakers–using the training of the paradigm as its instrument. There seems to be consensus emerging in the literature that policymakers are highly averse to shifting their beliefs and engage in motivated reasoning to justify their initial policy choices. Sticking to priors and being inattentive to evidence may stymie the implementation of good policies that might otherwise spur economic development. How can policymakers be made more receptive to evidence? Will training them in concepts associated with the credibility revolution make them more likely to shift their beliefs? Will it induce them to change their policy choices? Can the econometrics training impact State capacity? Can it increase uptake of tax policy for which there is causal evidence? To answer these questions, we randomize policymakers in econometrics training and trace its impact on their attitudes, policy and the population.
