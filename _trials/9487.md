abstract: "Women are often under-represented in competitive careers---including in the Indian civil services, where positions are allocated through a system of merit-based exams and successful placement often requires multiple exam attempts. Using data from a state public service commission, we show that women make fewer attempts than men in these exams, which leads to gender gaps in placement. We run a survey experiment to understand why women make fewer attempts than men. We focus on two main explanations: (i) the role of marriage and household constraints, or (ii) a lack of information about the number of attempts required for successful placement. We implement primes and information treatments related to these two explanations and measure how they affect choice over and investments in exam-taking.
