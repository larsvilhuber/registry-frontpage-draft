abstract: "This project studies how a scientific approach to entrepreneurial decision-making impacts start-up performance of entrepreneurs with a background in science. We argue that entrepreneurs with a background in science apply more effectively the scientific approach in a business context, since they can exploit their prior knowledge of the scientific method that they learnt in the context of natural sciences. More specifically, we expect that entrepreneurs with a background in science who learn about the scientific approach: (i) exit more, (ii) pivot more and (iii) earn more revenue than other entrepreneurs. To test our predictions, we embed a field experiment into a pre-accelerator program and use this setting to randomly assign entrepreneurial teams to either learn about a scientific approach or not."
