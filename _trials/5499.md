abstract: "Bayesian Updating is the dominant theory of learning in economics and other disciplines. According to this theory, decision-makers have prior beliefs which they update according to Bayes rule after receiving new information. The theory is silent about how individuals react to receiving information that the subjects have not observed previously and, hence, which they may deem impossible. Recent theoretical literature has put forth a possible mechanism, called “reverse Bayesianism”, which decision-makers may use to react to unforeseen events. We started to explore experimentally testing reverse Bayesianism in a previous experiment (AEARCTR-0003815). Our experimental findings show that participants are consistent with the theory, while they do not show to have an expectation of the unknown. 

Because of these findings, our goal in this project is to understand when individuals cease to expect something new. Additionally we aim to test reverse Bayesianism in a more dynamic context where more than one unforeseen event might occur. A summary description of our design follows. Participants will be asked to repeatedly draw coloured balls from a virtual urn. After every draw, participants are asked to declare their perceived proportion all colours that have been drawn until that point and for any other colour not yet drawn or observed. There will be a total of 30 draws and this will be repeated for 4 different virtual urns. The beliefs on the proportions of different colours will be incentivised using the Karni (2009) method.
 
We have two treatments. In the “2 - outcome” treatment, participants will first make draws out of a 2-outcome urn, while in the “4-outcome” treatment participants will first make draws out of 4-outcome urn. Following the first urn, the three following urns will be for both treatments: 3-outcome, 2-outcome and 4-outcome. In the supporting documents, we attach a diagram detailing this sequence for each treatment. 

This design will allow us to explore if participants have an expectation of the unknown and additionally when does this expectation diminish. Contrasting our two treatments, will allow us to consider whether a difference between individuals that have experienced a broader environment or a narrower environment will exist. Specifically, how experience might cause an individual’s expectation of the unknown to diminish differently. Furthermore, we will be able to consider multiple instances of new events occurring and thus testing reverse Bayesianism in a more dynamic fashion. We will in particular address the following questions: Do individuals naturally expect events that were previously considered impossible? Does experience affect an individual’s expectation of unknown events? How do individuals update their beliefs about the urn composition after an unexpected event takes place?
