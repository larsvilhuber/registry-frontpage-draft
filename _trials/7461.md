abstract: "Recent research indicates that microcredit has not contributed significantly to poverty reduction. Take up of affordable credit by the poor for investment in businesses, education and health turned out to be very low. We argue that this can be explained by risk aversion when investment affects the probability of success of a risky project. Our model abstracts from fixed costs in the production technology, commonly
assumed in the existing literature. There are no imperfections in the loan market, and we abstract from assumptions about false beliefs by the poor regarding the production function or other behavioral assumptions. We hypothesize that to facilitate investment and thereby reduce poverty, policy should be aimed at reducing the risk faced by the poor.
In the experiment, we aim to test our theoretical findings empirically. We predict that while the distribution of the investment choices in the return game will be unimodal, in the probability game it should be bimodal, especially for the risk-averse individuals. Second, we predict that risk-averse agents should select a lottery with a higher probability of winning, rather than a lottery with the same probability but higher return. For that, we will ask participants to provide us with step-by-step investment decisions of five equal portions of their entire endowment. The participants will choose either to invest the portion into an investment with a higher chance of winning or into an investment with a higher return. We also predict that risk aversion goes hand-in-hand with respondentsâ€™ household income and will differ by gender.  "
