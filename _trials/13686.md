abstract: "Baseline data collection is a common practice among empirical researchers. While asking questions is often cheaper, observational data is typically trusted more. In this study we develop an experiment in Bangladesh where we randomly assign respondents to (i) only self-reported questions on sanitation behavior, (ii) a combination of observation and self-reported questions on sanitation behavior, or (iii) no questions on sanitation behavior. Our first objective is to determine if observational data influences self-reported responses at baseline. Subsequently, we will examine whether self-reported questions and observational data impact both self-reported and observed sanitation measures at the endline. Additionally, we will investigate whether self-reported questions and observation affect the impact of a separate sanitation intervention."
