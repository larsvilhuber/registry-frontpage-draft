abstract: "1. Background and study aims.
Public health depends on both the technological developments of medical treatments and the public's willingness to take up these treatments. The publicâ€™s willingness to take up novel treatments depends on the public's beliefs about the costs and benefits of the treatments. By tracing updates on public beliefs about COVID-19 vaccines before and after they began to be administered to the general public in Japan, we investigate the relationships between the evolution of public beliefs about COVID-19 vaccines and the public willingness to take up the vaccines. This study is a follow-up study of AEARCTR-0010145 (https://doi.org/10.1257/rct.10145-1.1) implemented in November 2022.

2. Who can participate?
We recruit a non-probability sample of 15,000 respondents in Japan through a survey company, Rakuten Insight, Ltd.

3. What does the study involve?
1) We ask whether respondents have taken COVID-19 vaccines and, if so, whether they experienced side effects.
2) We ask whether the respondents have taken a second, third, and fourth doses of COVID-19 vaccines and whether they want to take a further dose of COVID-19 vaccine.
3) We ask the respondents to choose the preferred hypothetical conditions for vaccination between the two, which are fully randomly generated by our conjoint experimental design. We allow the respondents to answer to deny either condition and not to take up COVID-19 vaccines.
4) We ask the respondents questions about their demographic and socioeconomic backgrounds.

4. What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?
As a benefit, respondents will receive a certain number of points to be used for shopping. Since the survey is administered through the internet, respondents will face no substantial risk.

5. Where is the study run from?
The survey will be conducted through the internet.

6. When is the study starting and how long is it expected to run for?
We plan to begin the survey on Februrary 27, 2023 and continue until we obtain responses from 15,000 respondents approximated on March 13, 2023. The duration is expected to be two weeks.

7. Who is funding the study?
The Japan Society for the Promotion of Science funds the study (SPS Grant-in-Aid KAKENHI JP18H03630)."
