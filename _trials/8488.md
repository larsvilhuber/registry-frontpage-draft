abstract: "This study aims to identify whether wise reasoning promotes prosocial behavior on the individual level. We investigate this by conducting a large-scale survey in several European countries. We measure wise reasoning on a general and on a specific scale of survey items. Prosocial behavior is firstly measured as individual behavior in a donation experiment and secondly through a set of survey items on real-world behavior, such as blood donations and behavior during the Corona pandemic."
