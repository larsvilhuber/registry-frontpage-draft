abstract: "Trial Design and Methods: This randomized controlled trial in Uganda evaluated the Information Motivation Behavioral (IMB) model's impact on reducing risky sexual behavior (RSB) among 213 participants with severe mental illness (SMI). Participants were divided into two groups: one receiving standard health education (control group) and the other receiving IMB model interventions (intervention group).
Results: The trial showed no significant difference in information scores between the groups post-intervention. However, there was a notable increase in motivation scores in the intervention group, suggesting the potential effectiveness of the IMB model.
Conclusions: Integrating the IMB model into mental health care services could improve sexual health education and promote safer sexual behaviors among individuals with SMI. The study recommends healthcare workers to incorporate sexual health discussions in routine care and calls for further research on the IMB model's integration into mental health care.
