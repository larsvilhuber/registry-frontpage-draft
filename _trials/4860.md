abstract: "Choice-matching is a recently developed method for eliciting honest responses to multiple choice questions in surveys (CvitaniÄ‡ et al., 2019).  Toussaert (2018) has also recently developed a method for incentivising predictions of one's own future behavior which avoids creating incentives to alter actual behavior. We test both of these methods in a general population survey on physical activity preferences and behavior by randomly assigning respondents to one of three versions of the same survey: one which uses choice-matching and the Toussaert method, another which uses choice-matching only, and a third which uses neither method. We test the effect of these methods on survey responses."
