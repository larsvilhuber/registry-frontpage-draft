abstract: "This study provides answers to two research questions. First, what are the impacts of corporate social responsibility (CSR) messages on employee attrition, productivity, and well-being? Second, we compare two types of CSR information-external CSR and internal CSR- to examine which type of CSR is more effective. 

We conduct a 3-month field experiment on more than 8,000 workers in 145 stores of a large multi-national spa chain home-based in China. The spa worker's job is physically exhausting. Workers have long working hours and the attrition rate is very high. Thus, the strategic provision of corporate social responsibility messages could be an effective managerial practice to improve employee attrition, productivity, and worker well-being.

We assign stores into two treatment groups and one control group. In both treatment groups, workers receive a corporate social responsibility message every other day through the company's information system. Our first treatment, labeled as "external CSR", is to send workers information about the firm's external CSR events in history. Examples include but are unlimited to the firm's subsidizing the socially disadvantaged groups, building schools, and donating during natural disasters. Our second treatment, labeled as "internal CSR", is to provide employees with information on the firm's internal CSR events, for example, setting up relief funding, providing resources for, and helping out its own workers during difficult times. The difference between the two treatments is that external CSR is not directed related to worker's welfare, while internal CSR is closely related. 

The field experiment starts on June 1st, 2020, and lasts 14 weeks (3 months)."
