abstract: "Non-cognitive skills are key predictors of central life outcomes such as educational attainment, job performance, earnings, health outcomes, and participation in risky behaviors. Despite their fundamental importance, we know surprisingly little about how non-cognitive skills form. By combining the collection of panel data (three to four waves) with an RCT design, we will provide causal evidence on investments as possible drivers of skill formation on top of comprehensive descriptive evidence on the formation of non-cognitive skills in childhood and adolescence. In defining non-cognitive skills, our project adopts the interdisciplinary and multidimensional approach in the emerging field of personality psychology and economics. In this field, the definition of non-cognitive skills encompasses both economic preferences (time, risk, and social preferences) and personality traits from psychology (Big Five, locus of control, self-control, self-esteem). The malleability of both preferences and personality traits during childhood and adolescence is our key interest.

In cooperation with Lions Clubs International, we will implement the social and emotional learning (SEL) program Lions Quest Skills for Growing (PreK-5) in grades 2 to 5 of 69 primary schools (treatment group) located in rural areas of Bangladesh. In total, our sample covers 135 schools from four districts (Chandpur, Gopalganj, Netrokona and Sunamganj) that are divided into treatment and control group by stratified randomization. 

We sample 3,000 children and their households, at least 20 from each school across grades 2 to 5. We will implement three waves of interviews: a baseline for the full sample of 3,000 households in 2018 (pre-treatment, wave 1), a short-run post-treatment measurement in 2019 (wave 2), and a longer-run follow-up in 2020 (wave 3). This allows us to identify short-run effects as well as to analyze whether possible treatment effects are sustained in the longer-run. We will not only analyze the impact of the intervention on the development of non-cognitive skills per se, but also be able to differentiate between different age groups, allowing for an analysis of heterogeneous treatment effects, and possibly to address the timing of skill-specific sensitive periods. Additionally, we will have data on an already existing sample of households from the same villages that was established earlier (“non-intervention sample”). It will extend our intervention sample with comprehensive information on demographics, socio-economic status, cognitive and non-cognitive skills on another 1,000 households."
