abstract: "In the field of decision-making under risk most theories and models assume that risk is communicated through precise numerical probabilities. This is an unrealistic assumption as individuals prefer to use verbal probability phrases (e.g. likely) when conveying risks. Previous research on verbal probability phrases typically focuses on how individuals translate such phrases into numerical values. The direct impact of verbal probabilities on risk preferences and subsequent decision-making is mostly unexplored. Within our experiment we analyze how the translation of verbal probability phrases lines up with subsequent decision-making. Additionally, we distinguish whether risk is communicated numerically or verbally and focus on how the two forms of communication may differently impact the risk preference and subsequent decision-making."
