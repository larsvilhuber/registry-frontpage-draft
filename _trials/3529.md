abstract: "Algorithms based on enormous amounts of data enable new ways of supporting decision making by integrating and improving data-driven predictions. The present projects investigates whether this algorithmic assistance can suppress ethical considerations in decision making. We will focus on two important drivers of this phenomenon, namely diffusion of responsibility (e.g., Bartling and Fischbacher, 2011) and ethical fading (e.g., Tenbrunsel and Messick, 2004). "
