abstract: "
Low-income countries suffer from both weak state capacity to mobilize taxes and chronic underdevelopment that reinforce each other. As a result they  collect very low tax revenue as a share of their GDP, compared with high income countries. This has partly led to chronic fiscal deficit, often resulting in rising debt levels, macroeconomic instability, growth volatility, and limited provision of basic social services. With the rising debt vulnerability in many low-income countries, improving domestic tax mobilization has become more critical. However, economic structure dominated by a large informal sector, culture of poor tax compliance due to weak institutions, and pervasive corruption remain serious impediments. For example, 27% of individuals surveyed by Afrobarometer  across 36 African countries believe that citizens should not pay taxes at all, and in some countries this figure was above 40%. One contributing factor for such adverse attitude towards tax compliance is low level of trust on government, including on tax authorities, who are generally perceived to be highly corrupt .  This paper examines the impact of two prominent strategies, threat of audits and persuasions/positive incentives,  that could improve tax compliance and provides evidence using novel data generated from fully randomized field experiment in Ethiopia. The experiment involved approximately 5000 businesses operating in Addis Ababa. The experiment was conducted during 2012 for two randomly selected groups in collaboration with revenue authorities. A duly signed letter of threat and a complementary letter from the revenue authority was hand delivered to the treatment groups. To avoid possibility of information sharing among recipients of the treatment letters, the timing was chosen such that it coincided at the fiscal year when businesses were expected to file profit tax returns. The threat letter contained information that the said firm had not been complying with its tax obligations and following that the revenue authority would undertake an audit that fiscal year. The letter also stated the penalties associated with tax evasion including financial payments as well prison terms. The 'persuasive letter" described in detail the positive behavior of the tax payer in complying with its duties' and provided information how because of such tax  payers the country was able to make remarkable achievements in the areas of infrastructure development, education, health and other areas of development. The control group did not receive any letter. All other information about the businesses was obtained from administrative data maintained by the revenue authorities. "
