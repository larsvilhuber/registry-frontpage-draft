abstract: "An on-demand courier company conducted city-level randomization from July to September 2024, dividing its more than 300 operating cities in mainland China into three groups: A, B, and C. In the Group A cities, the platformâ€™s flexible workers (riders) are informed that they can earn platform tokens (which can be redeemed for priority order access) by performing good deeds. In the Group B cities, couriers are told that by doing good deeds, they have the chance to earn platform badges (both physical and displayed in the app). In the Group C cities, couriers are encouraged to do good deeds, but no reward is given. We studied how the mood of the riders affects their pro-social behavior and how their pro-social behavior interacts with their normal business, and how the company's pro-social campaign helps with its brand image, hence affecting its competition with other platforms."
