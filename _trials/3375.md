abstract: "The goal of this study is to examine whether higher utilization of social services helps prevent/delay recidivism among ex-inmates. We partner with a social service provider for ex-inmates and randomize participants into treatments that incentivize usage of social services at various intensities. We will keep track of social service usage and incidents of re-arrest record to see how usage of these services affect recidivism.
