abstract: "We test the effect a steeper wage progression between low-tier employees (e.g., frontline service providers) and higher-tier employees (e.g. supervisors, bosses) on organizational performance, and investigate whether this effect differs in more vs. less- meritocratic promotion systems. While steep wage progression may incentivize lower-tier workers to perform better in a meritocratic regime (through career incentives), it may instead demotivate workers in a non-meritocratic regime (through fairness or inequality concerns). 

We collaborate with a national public organization—the Community Health Worker Program in Sierra Leone—in which supervisors (high-tier workers) are in charge of monitoring and advising about 9 health workers each (lower-tier workers). Each time a supervisor leaves her position, one of the 9 health workers located in that “health unit” (henceforth, PHU) is promoted to the supervisor position. 

Our project takes places in 372 PHUs across 6 districts of Sierra Leone. It introduces exogenous variation at the PHU level on: (1) the perceived gap between health workers’ and supervisors’ earnings (higher vs. lower perceived wage progression), and (2) the extent to which the promotion process is meritocratic or not (higher vs. lower meritocracy). 

Our goal is twofold. First, we aim to test the differential effect of increasing the perceived vertical wage steepness in regimes that are more vs. less meritocratic. In particular, we are interested in understanding whether a larger vertical pay gap can motivate workers in meritocratic regimes while demotivate workers in non-meritocratic regimes. Second, we aim to test the effect of meritocratic promotions per se on worker performance, and the heterogonous effect by worker type (ability, social connections, etc.).
