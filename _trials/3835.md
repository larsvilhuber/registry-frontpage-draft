abstract: "This study looks at the effects of providing teachers raises based on their students' test scores versus their principal's rating of them as compared to a flat raise. We measure the effect on teacher behavior in and out of the classroom, teacher retention, and student performance. While subjective performance pay is easier to implement and can be more successful at addressing multi-tasking concerns, there is a worry that principals may be biased against certain groups or show favoritism toward teachers they are socially connected to. We look for evidence of gender discrimination and favoritism toward connected teachers as well as heterogeneity in treatment effects by more or less biased principals. Finally, we introduce an additional randomization as to how often principals observe certain teachers to vary the principals' accuracy of information. We look to see if principals accurately update and if teachers in response work harder when their effort is more observable. "
