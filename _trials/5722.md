abstract: "Like much digital technology, mobile banking is characterized by network externalities. It is most valuable when employers, shops, family, and friends are also part of the network. Adoption patterns are thus shaped by how and where the technology is supplied and marketed. We investigate the role of network externalities and implications for gender gaps in technology adoption through a randomized experiment on the choice to adopt the bKash mobile banking service in Bangladesh. We experimentally vary decision contexts for urban migrant workers and their rural-based families, the two main nodes in their networks. In the first treatment, we randomly select some of the rural families to be trained on the technology before we begin training sessions for their relatives who work in Dhaka. These migrants thus make adoption choices with the ability to know that their originating families are already familiar with mobile banking (and may have already adopted). In the second treatment we randomize whether the marketing of bKash is pro-family: we prompted migrants with information that their originating families had expressed general interest in adoption. Both interventions increased adoption rates relative to individualistic interventions, on average by 5.1 percentage points (measured imprecisely, s.e.=5.0), but the interventions have different and highly gendered impacts. When female migrants are visited after their originating families, adoption of mobile money increased by 18.7 percentage points on average (s.e.=9.5), with no comparable effects for male migrants. When migrants received the pro-social marketing treatment, adoption rates by males increased by over 11.4 percentage points (s.e.=5.1), but not for women. The results show that network effects matter within family networks and shape patterns of inclusion, and that thematically similar interventions can have different implications for patterns of technology adoption."
