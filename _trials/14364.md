abstract: "This study investigates how private investors make investment decisions based on sustainability ratings from different rating agencies and whether they react to inconsistencies between these ratings. To explore this, we conduct an investment experiment with German private investors, asking them to allocate money between a conventional and a sustainable fund. Both funds are identical except for the sustainable fundâ€™s sustainability ratings, sourced from different agencies. Participants are exposed to different combinations of sustainability ratings, and the dependent variable is the proportion of money allocated to the sustainable fund. We hypothesize that higher sustainability ratings will tend to increase investments in the sustainable fund, while rating divergence will reduce them. We also aim to examine which investor groups are most sensitive to changes in sustainability ratings and rating inconsistencies."
