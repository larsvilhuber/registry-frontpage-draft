abstract: "This randomized controlled trial employs a two-phase lab-in-the-field experiment to quantify gender-based discrimination in mortgage loan evaluations. Credit analysts will assess 16 randomized, pre-approved applications that vary by gender, age, and marital status. The study focuses on middle-income applicants, as identified by Hern√°ndez et al. (2021), particularly targeting those between 30 and 40 years of age. It also accounts for family size and spousal income as potential confounding variables. The research introduces a renegotiation parameter, building upon Amanatullah & Morris (2010), to ascertain the influence of negotiation settings on loan conditions.

In the registration phase, credit analysts undergo the OCEAN personality test, the Rosenberg self-esteem scale, and the Wonderlic psychometric test. These metrics serve as control variables in the subsequent analysis. The evaluation phase involves the appraisal of synthetic applicant profiles, focusing on loan terms and conditions. Utilizing a controlled platform for decision-making, this study aims to contribute nuanced insights into gender discrimination within the mortgage market, thereby enriching the discourse on financial gender equality."
