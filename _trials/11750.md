abstract: "This study aims at measuring human subjects’ economic rationality using budgetary experiments in four domains: risk, time, social, and food preferences. In each domain, there are 25 decision tasks, whereby subjects are endowed with 100 points to allocate between two commodities with different prices. We measure economic rationality by assessing the consistency of subjects’ 25 decisions with utility maximization in classic revealed preference theory. Subjects are randomly assigned to three conditions. In the Baseline condition, subjects perform the classical budgetary experiments in all four domains with random order. The Price Frame condition proceeds exactly as the Baseline condition except that we use a different price quote method. In the Discrete Choice condition, subjects are asked to choose among 11 discrete options schemes from the budget line instead of choosing any scheme from the budget line."
