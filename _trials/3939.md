abstract: "The RCT studies the impact of making the energy-efficiency trade-offs salient on purchases of refrigerators from an online retailer. Experimental treatments display the energy consumption costs of refrigerators in Euro, and vary the level of aggregation of such information (1 year versus 15 years). Data collection began in June 2018 and ended in October 2018. The intervention targeted an estimated number of around 610k visits on the online retailer refrigerator web pages. Our analysis will study the impact of the experimental treatments on purchasing and search behavior of customers who visited the website and purchased a refrigerator on the online platform over the study period. We are currently in the process of merging and cleaning the various sources of data, detailed in the PAP, and expcet to begin data analysis in March 2019. "
