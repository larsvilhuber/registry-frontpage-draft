abstract: "Earlier studies have found that home visiting programs have significant effects on children's development in the short run and long run, but the effects especially on cognitive skills may fade out in the medium run. This study evaluates the mid-term effects of a home-based parenting program, with a special focus on children's multi-dimensional outcomes and parenting practices. This study is based on an earlier RCT that was randomized across 131 villages in rural China comparing 66 treatment villages, where weekly visits were made to households with children between 18 and 30 months of age to deliver a structured stage-based curriculum designed to teach parenting skills, with 65 villages in the control group. This follow-up study was done when sampled children were 3-5 years old, which is a critical period to develop time preference according to developmental psychologists. We adopt a real incentivized Marshmallow Test paradigm to elicit children's time preference. We also have a parenting style questionnaire as developmental psychologists suggest parenting style is the main determinant of children's time preference. 

This study is expected to answer several debates in the literature. First, a comprehensive evaluation of children's cognitive skills, non-cognitive skills, and economic preferences can help to answer why the intervention effects on cognitive skills fade out in the medium run but the treated children finally achieve higher in adulthood. Induced changes in non-cognitive skills and economic preferences may act as mediators. Second, it contributes to a broader literature on the origins of inequality by focusing on the formation of time preference in early childhood. Third, as the earlier RCT is designed to improve parenting skills, we could establish some links between parenting practices and children's outcomes.
