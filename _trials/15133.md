abstract: "This study evaluates the impact of "Opgang-til-Opgang," a municipal program designed to support welfare-dependent families through integrated social care. The intervention assigns each participating family a team of two dedicated social workers who assist in navigating the often-complex interactions with multiple caseworkers and government authorities within the modern welfare system. By offering a single point of contact and personalized guidance, the program seeks to reduce administrative burdens for the families and improve their overall well-being.

The program is being evaluated using a randomized allocation of eligible families within a local government jurisdiction, allowing for direct comparison between participants and non-participants. The study focuses on three primary outcomes: (1) changes in welfare receipt, (2) improvements in employment for adults and youths in the household, and (3) reductions in risky behaviors among children. This research is intended to provide new insights into the potential of integrated social care to address systemic challenges faced by vulnerable families in the welfare system.
