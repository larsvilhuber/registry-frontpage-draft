abstract: "The California Policy Lab will evaluate the impact of the Santa Clara County Public Defender’s Office’s Pre-Arraignment Representation & Review Team (PARR) during the pilot implementation on pre-trial detention, release at arraignment, and case outcomes. The pilot will use a random process to assign legal staff to clients who are booked on felony charges and not released by a night judge within 24 hours of booking. "
