abstract: "This survey experiment will study the impact on public opinion of describing Australia’s foreign aid response using two different frames. The frames used will be: a political frame in which recent increases in foreign aid are expressly tied to the current (conservative) government; and a coronavirus frame in which recent increases in foreign aid will be expressly tied to the use the aid is being put – helping counter the impacts of Covid-19 in developing countries. 

The impact will be measured in terms of views on Australian aid volumes.
