abstract: "We aim to investigate how information about the causes of homosexuality affect people's beliefs and behavior towards sexual minorities. The mechanism suggested in the study is the following: when sexual orientation is perceived to be biologically predetermined (thus uncontrollable), people's attitudes will be more tolerant towards sexual minority groups. The second direction of the study is to explore whether religiosity plays a role in sexual orientation discrimination. In this regard, we employ priming approach. Next, we elicit job-related stereotypes about sexual minority groups. To study this topic we use online information provision experiments."
