abstract: "Tutoring stands out as a highly effective educational policy for improving student outcomes, but its implementation is hindered by issues of scalability and cost. One solution involves equipping teachers with enhanced skills in utilizing Computer Assisted Learning (CAL) to simulate the tutoring experience at a lower expense. A recent evaluation of this approach, called "Khoaching with Khan Academy" demonstrated meaningful improvements in standardized math test scores for elementary students whose teachers were randomly assigned to receive such assistance, as compared to students whose teachers did not benefit from it. Although this intervention successfully enhanced average math scores, the study also highlighted significant variations in CAL practice time both within and across classrooms receiving the treatment. To improve engagement of the Khan Academy platform and increase practice time, the KWiK program will leverage Khanmigo, a ChatGPT virtual assistant developed by Khan Academy, as a personalized tutor to support studentâ€™s progress with Khan Academy assignments.  The additional improvement to the program is from dedicated practice time.  Participating schools will set aside 30-45 minutes at the end of school during independent learning time for students to practice on KA with khanmigo.

We will conduct a grade-level RCT, randomizing Grades 6-8 within each of about 20 schools for students to receive the program for Tier 2 and 3 students.  Teachers would receive mandatory training before the beginning of school with simplified instructions and a project manager within the district would be hired to manage khoach meetings and field visits to help ensure fidelity.  All students would be given khanmigo access to maximize power for estimating the full program. The analysis will include impacts both at the end of the program in year 1, and a year after the program has concluded, at the end of year 2.
