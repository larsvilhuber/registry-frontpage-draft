abstract: "Low-income families in the United States struggle to make ends meet and rates of hardship are greatest among families with children. Although a number of social policies are designed to ameliorate the negative consequences of poverty, access to cash assistance is difficult to obtain or insufficient to meet familiesâ€™ basic needs. Additionally, the recent coronavirus outbreak has dramatically expanded the number of families in need of assistance. This study will examine the impact of an unconditional cash transfer on the social and economic wellbeing of low-income families with children. Randomly selected low-income families with children will receive a one-time lump-sum cash payment. Families in both the treatment and control groups will be interviewed and tracked for up to six months to assess the impacts of the transfer on material hardship, mental health, parenting, child wellbeing and partner relationships. Given recent interest in unconditional cash transfers, this study has the potential to inform policy debates about the effectiveness of such transfers, especially during serious economic crises."
