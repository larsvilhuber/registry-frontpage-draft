abstract: "This project provides evidence on how cooperative inclination is related to professional behavior and success in a large multinational software corporation. We analyze data to be elicited through artefactual field experiments and company data to be linked on the individual and group level. Also, potential sources of naturally occurring experiments as well as potential field interventions are anticipated. The three main hypotheses we are going to address are the effect of cooperative inclination measured via variants of the public goods game on main outcome variables of professional behavior within a company (1), the predictive power of cooperative norms elicited through coordination mechanisms (2), and the external validity of these experimental measures of cooperation (3).
