abstract: "The global road safety epidemic, with 1.35 million fatalities annually and 90\% occurring in developing countries, has become a critical issue for economic development. This study investigates the effectiveness of contracts in reducing speeding behavior among motor taxi drivers in urban Uganda. Given the informal and semiformal clustering of workers in this setting, the research design varies the type and visibility to peers belonging to the same cluster of monetary incentives offered to drivers and assesses their impact on driving behavior, labor market outcomes, contract demand, and the environment. The use of GPS technology enables the collection of high-frequency driving behavior data, which serves as the basis for designing credible contracts and observing behavior during and after the contract period."
