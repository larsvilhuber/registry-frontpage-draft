abstract: "A growing body of work has begun to investigate how a lack of financial resources can have an impact on cognition. For instance, using natural variation in resources due to a lack of consumption smoothing before harvest-time, Mani et al. (2013) provided evidence Indian farmers had greater working memory and cognitive control capacity after a harvest than before. However, some of these results have been difficult to replicate. Carvalho et al. (2016) found minimal differences in cognitive measurements (aside from present bias) when they surveyed a group of low-income Americans before and after a payday. In this study, we make psychological measurements of low-income workers in Abu Dhabi before and after a payday and hope to add to this literature in several ways. First, we measure cortisol, the gold standard biomarker for stress (Kirschbaum and Hellhammer 1994). By measuring changes in cortisol around a payday, we can make comparisons to the large existing literature on cognition and cortisol (e.g. Kandassamy et al. 2014) to understand the magnitude of changes we might expect around a payday. Second, we measure model-based decision-making (Daw et al. 2011), a computational formulation of dual system theories of decision making. Previous studies have linked variation in model-based or goal-based decision making to stress (e.g. Otto et al. 2013, Quaedflieg et al. 2019) which suggests that there might be variation around a payday. Understanding the relationship between poverty and "model-basedness" may provide for a new understanding of decision-making under poverty. Third, we measure changes in feelings of control and perceived constraints which have been theorized to underlie some changes in cognitive processes under poverty (Pepper and Nettle 2017, Krauss et al. 2011). Finally, we attempt to improve the precision and generalizability of our measurements over previous studies by making within-person measurements and including a true control group, as well as improving our control over the timing of measurements. We hope that these additions to the literature will help improve understanding of mechanisms of povertyâ€™s potential effects on cognition."
