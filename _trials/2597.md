abstract: "People are highly skeptical towards inequalities that arise due to pure luck, such as the toss of a coin. In contrast, they largely accept inequalities stemming from talent differences. However, talent may be fundamentally understood as coming about from a lucky draw in the ``genetic lottery." The question arises why inequalities from talent are accepted even when an individual has done nothing to develop her talent. We investigate two potentially morally relevant distinctions between a ``talent" lottery and a pure luck lottery. The first is whether the indivisibility of talent-luck from its owner implies that it is a personal trait with a legitimate claim on the outcome. The second is whether it is the act of exerting effort on a lucky draw that makes talent a more legitimate source of inequalities."
