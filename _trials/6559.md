abstract: "The Chilean Ministry of Housing and Urbanism (MINVU) implemented the first rental voucher program in Latin America in 2014. It was the first time that rental housing was being subsidized in the country. Every year, six out of ten assigned vouchers are left unused and many families move with their vouchers to neighborhoods with poorer characteristics.

In this project we evaluate different strategies to reduce demand side barriers faced by rental voucher recipients. In particular, we analyze how a low-cost online counseling program that provides different pieces of online information to voucher holders affects their voucher utilization rate and residential mobility-related outcomes.

Vouchers recipients are randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms with the purpose of reducing different demand side barriers. The first group receives information to reduce information frictions about program’s rules. The second group is provided with information on neighborhood characteristics and the third group gets access to information about the benefits from living in better areas. Information is provided through an online platform, Aprendo y Arriendo (Learn and Rent).
