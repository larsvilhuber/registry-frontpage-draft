abstract: "Business support programs, such as classroom-based training or consulting services, are widely used by developing country governments to enhance the performance of small-scale enterprises. Although job creation and the central role of the small business sector for overall employment are one common justification for implementing such programs, they are often not designed to target employment outcomes directly and few studies have established a clear link between business support interventions and job creation or employment quality. We conduct a rigorous impact evaluation of a support program for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Côte d’Ivoire. The program will deliver consulting services to 250 Ivorian MSMEs over the duration of six months and focuses on the dimensions of financial management and human resource management. Beneficiary MSMEs are selected randomly from the pool of more than 450 MSMEs who applied to participate in the program, passed the eligibility assessment, and responded to a baseline survey. Our evaluation covers key outcomes at two levels. At the firm level, we will consider (i) employment in quantitative terms, (ii) employment security and quality, (iii) HR management practices, (iv) firm performance, (v) capital and labor productivity, (vi) access to finance and financial constraints, as well as (vii) financial management practices. At the individual level, outcomes are (i) employment, (ii) employment quality, and (iii) mobility."
