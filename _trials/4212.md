abstract: "We propose a pilot randomized evaluation of strategies to facilitate advance directive completion in the aged 55+ patient population of our partner, Providence St. Joseph Health (PSJH). Despite the significant economic and personal implications of end-of-life health care decisions, many fail to document their wishes or to select a representative who can make medical decisions on their behalf. Descriptive evidence suggests that this results in sub-optimal outcomes including dissatisfaction and potentially unnecessary medical spending. However, it is not well understood why patients fail to engage in this apparently high-value planning. We propose a pilot randomized trial to study the effect of a targeted informational outreach to promote advance directive completion among 3,000 patients in 5 PSJH primary care clinics. This study is a follow-up and refinement of a JPAL-funded pilot study conducted during summer 2018 in two clinics at PSJH. Key outcomes will include advance directive completion rates, decisions made on advance directive forms, and eventually observed care decisions. We will also leverage surveys and granular data on patient health to better understand barriers to advance care planning and relate to underlying economic theory that explains behavior."
