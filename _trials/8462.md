abstract: "We study households' beliefs about the autocorrelation of annual returns of the aggregate stock market and the role of these beliefs in investment decisions. Based on a survey of retail investors at a German online bank, we document substantial heterogeneity in individuals' perceived autocorrelation, with a majority believing in mean reversion of  returns. These beliefs predict how respondents adjust their portfolios in response to market movements, as measured in administrative account data. We provide a random half of our respondents with historical information on the low predictive power of realized returns for year-ahead returns. The intervention persistently reduces respondents' perceived autocorrelation, and shifts their expected year-ahead return accordingly. We find only minor adjustments of investment decisions in the short term. However, among those believing in mean reversion before the intervention, treated respondents display a significantly smaller increase in equity purchases in response to the COVID-19 stock market crash four to five months after the treatment. Our results suggest that heterogeneity in perceived models is a causal driver of trade in asset markets, and may more generally lead to differences in economic decisions across individuals."
