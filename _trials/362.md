abstract: "Researchers are using a randomized evaluation to examine the impact of subsidizing transportation on job search activities and youth employment outcomes by providing prepaid bus tickets for two major public transportation systems, Rea Vaya and Metrobus, in South Africa. From the database of unemployed youth (between 18 and 30 years old) provided by the South African Department of Labor, researchers randomly invited 1,200 job seekers to participate in the program. The study consists of two treatment treatment groups, with individuals in the sample being randomly assigned to either a group receiving a conditional transport subsidy, an unconditional transport subsidy or a control group receiving no subsidy. Researchers will gather data through interviews with participants on job search activity, job history, and various socio-economic characteristics. They will also extract data from the two transport systems on travel patterns and transactions made using the cards provided to study participants."
