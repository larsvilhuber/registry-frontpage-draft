abstract: "The Colombian tutela provides a swift mechanism for resolving state violations of individual rights. The Colombian Constitutional Court has provided innovative solutions through tutela to a variety of systemic bureaucratic failures, yet, the practical impact of these innovations depends on the ability of claimants to obtain through a court order what they could not get on their own, and that depends on compliance. Compliance is commonly monitored in legal systems via indirect monitoring, where litigants are themselves responsible for alerting judges to problems. Recently courts have begun directly monitoring compliance by tracking their own orders. We conduct a cluster randomized trial designed to evaluate the effect of direct compliance monitoring. Specifically, we consider the effect of increasing health provider expectations that the Colombian public will become aware of their activities on compliance with tutela orders governing health rights. Our hypothesis is that providers that expect public scrutiny of their behavior will experience better compliance outcomes than providers who do not.
