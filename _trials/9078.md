abstract: "The COVID-19 pandemic has had unimaginably tragic human costs and devastating negative effects on countries’ economies, triggering an unprecedented economic crisis worldwide and sinking the global economy into the deepest recession not seen in eight decades. Systematic studies documenting socioeconomic consequences from the pandemic, let alone effective strategies to mitigate these consequences, remain scarce. This study addresses this question head-on, leveraging two large and coordinated cluster randomized controlled trials (RCTs) carried out as part of the rollout of World Bank-funded public works programs in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Egypt and Tunisia between 2015 and 2021 and at least one endline survey in each country during the COVID-19 pandemic. It provides systematic quantitative evidence on economic conditions as a result of the pandemic and ascertains the extent to which participation in workfare programs helped mitigate the negative socioeconomic consequences of the pandemic and quarantine measures to contain it. The primary outcomes of interest concern potential socioeconomic consequences of COVID-19 on households. The array of any such consequences is broad, but this study focuses on six broad outcome families: (i) exposure to COVID-19; (ii) consumption and food security; (iii) economic shocks (e.g., job loss or drop in productivity and earnings); (iv) coping mechanisms; (v) children’s health and schooling; and (vi) subjective/psychological well-being.
