abstract: "While recent studies have found that social pressure can induce people to comply with various norms, little is known about how norms are organically communicated and enforced in everyday life. Anecdotally, when we see someone violate a norm, we are often hesitant to do anything in response. The project measures the incentivized willingness to pay to (not) give social pressure, in the context of college students emailing unregistered peers to register to vote for the 2020 U.S. General Election. Furthermore, it decomposes this cost into Self- (e.g., fear of confrontation) and Other-regarding (e.g., altruism) sources, and examines whether pressuring others increases their chances of registering. These findings are crucial to understand the true welfare costs and effectiveness of policies that aim to use social norms."
