abstract: "How can intergroup understanding be increased? We study this question in the context of refugee migration to developed countries, focusing on the attitudes of high school aged students in Sweden. We study a role-playing intervention which simulates a typical refugee experience, including initial flight, as well as navigating bureaucracy and attempting to find asylum in another country. The intervention takes approximately 1-2 hours, takes place during school hours, and is hypothesized to induce native students to take the perspective of refugees, thereby yielding more positive beliefs about refugees. The intervention is provided to all students, but a random subset is surveyed just prior to the intervention, while the treatment group is surveyed afterwards."
