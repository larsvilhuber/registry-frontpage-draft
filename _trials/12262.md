abstract: "This study implements a clustered Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) across two districts in a Northeastern state with a state preschool program. The research aims to assess the effectiveness of access to the full digital Creative Curriculum (CC) ecosystem and associated professional development provided by Teaching Strategies, relative to practice-as-usual in districts currently using Creative Curriculum. 

In this RCT, one group of coaches and the teachers/classrooms they work with in two districts serve as the control group receiving no intervention(n=60 teachers), while the other group of coaches and the teachers/classrooms they work with form the treatment group (n=60 teachers). Randomization was completed in the Fall of 2021, before the commencement of study activities. Clustering at the coach level is designed to account for shared professional development activities within each cluster. The study includes a third arm where the outcomes are assessed in randomly selected preschools classrooms across the state (n=60 teachers).

Primary outcome measures used to evaluate the impact of the intervention include two measures of classroom quality (in the 2021-22 school year and again in the 2023-24 school year). Secondary outcomes encompass child cognitive assessments (language, literacy, and math), children's executive functions, social-emotional development (teacher report), and creativity. These assessments are planned for the fall of 2023 and the spring of 2024 to assess childrenâ€™s growth over the school year. Implementation is captured through measures of cumulative hours of training, engagement with the ecosystem and fidelity of implementation. "
