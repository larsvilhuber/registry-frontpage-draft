abstract: "This study will examine whether educational interventions can improve individuals' ability to recognize and avoid financial fraud.  Participants in a nationally representative survey panel will be randomized either to a control condition, a video-based education treatment, or a text-based education treatment.  Half of the video (text) treatment group will receive the text (video) intervention three months after the initial intervention.  We will examine the effects of the treatments on individuals' abilities to identify fraudulent investment opportunities both immediately and six months after the initial intervention, and heterogeneity in efficacy by age group.
