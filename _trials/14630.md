abstract: "Understanding how people understand complex causal models is paramount to facilitate the implementation of the kind of policies needed to address some of the most pressing issues that society faces. This pre-registration refers to a survey – one in a series of more surveys – collecting data on people’s understanding of complex policies and corresponding narratives. This survey focuses on carbon pricing. Besides piloting our approach to complex mental models, this survey also provides a snapshot of public support for and perceptions of carbon pricing in October to early November 2024. The survey oversamples residents of Washington state, which are asked to vote on an initiative (Initiative 2117) aimed at repealing the current carbon pricing scheme, known as “cap and invest.” Hence, this data collection also serves the causal analysis of public support.
