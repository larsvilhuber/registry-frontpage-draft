abstract: "Superstar assets sustainably grow their value far into the future.  Given that superstars are attractive and rare, that people tend to practice base rate neglect, and that regular assets can appear to grow like superstars for several periods, investors may overdiagnose the probability of assets being superstars and may overpay for such assets in the market.  To assess this possibility, a laboratory experiment is presented in which subjects observe a limited history of a risky asset, are informed about the relevant base rates and movement probabilities, and must guess the posterior probabilities that the asset is a superstar as well as its final payoff and place a bid to purchase the asset.
