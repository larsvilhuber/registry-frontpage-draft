abstract: "The epidemiological transition has resulted in an increased burden of non-communicable diseases such as hypertension throughout the developing world. As countries adapt to this new environment, they must find cost-effective ways of screening for, and treating these diseases. With the proliferation of mobile technology as well as the increased evidence for the effectiveness of cash transfers we will be conducting a randomized-controlled trial in rural Tanzania to examine the usage of an SMS-based approach of informing individuals of the dangers of non-communicable diseases and offering financial incentives for hypertension and diabetes screening. Beyond estimating the overall impact of this program, we will measure how much of the impact is derived from offsetting the opportunity cost of screening as well as the impact from providing negative prices. The study includes four arms: (1) Pure Control, (2) Information Only, (3) Information + Small Transfer, and (4) Information + Larger Transfer. Due to the small area where our study takes place, we will also be examining how information spreads between individuals in the treatment and pure control arms to assess the effects of social networks on program success."
