abstract: "Despite legal restrictions, child marriage remains prevalent in Bangladesh and in fact have gone up from 31% to 42% between 2020 and 2023. BRAC's Social Empowerment and Legal Protection (SELP) program is implementing an intervention that combines life-skills training and networking called "Shwapno Sharothi" (SS), and layering a conditional cash transfer component. This study employs a two-stage cluster Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to evaluate the impact of the empowerment (i.e. SS) and the marginal impacts of providing monthly conditoinal cash transfers of two different values. The RCT operates across 5 districts in Bangladesh, targeting 450 clusters (primarily a village) with a total sample size of 11,250 adolescent girls aged 13â€“17. Clusters are randomly assigned to four groups:

1.	SS only = 140 
2.	SS + High cash = 100 
3.	SS+ Low Cash = 100 
4.	Control = 110

The study will measure the impact of these interventions on child marriage prevalence and gender norms with a midline after the completion of the program and an endline one year after the completion of the program. Additionally, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted to by comparing the costs associated with the interventions and potential improvement by applying different targeting approaches. "
