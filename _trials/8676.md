abstract: "In a web platform that reproduces a shop that sells food products, we investigate whether it is possible to induce consumers to reduce the carbon footprint of their basket by using monetary incentives (a carbon tax in our case) and/or non-monetary incentives (traffic lights carbon labels in our case).
The objective of our research is to investigate whether a carbon tax and a traffic lights mechanism implemented on food products are, first, efficient in encouraging consumers to reduce the carbon footprint of their basket of food and, second, whether these two types of incentives are complement (i.e., their joint effect is stronger compared to their effect when used separately) or substitutes (i.e., their joint effect is weaker compared to their effect when used separately).
