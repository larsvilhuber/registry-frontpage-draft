abstract: "The Alliance for Catholic Education (ACE) is implementing the ACE Ascent Program, a new program which will provide math teachers in Catholic schools with training and professional development with the goal of improving studentsâ€™ academic achievement. LEO is working with ACE to help them randomly select schools who will participate in the program. LEO will support ACE by randomly selecting teachers for the program and, in the future, assisting ACE with data analysis to determine if their program had an impact on the academic performance of students, particularly in the subject of math."
