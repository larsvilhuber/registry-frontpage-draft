abstract: "Economics lags other disciplines in inclusivity both as a field of study and career track, with disproportionately low representation of women and racial and ethnic minority groups, relative both to the population at large and to other academic disciplines. To address this challenge, the Becker Friedman Institute at the University of Chicago has launched the “Expanding Diversity in Economics program” (EDE Program) to help attract underrepresented undergraduate students to economics. Although diversity and inclusion programs are increasingly common in educational and workplace settings, virtually no rigorous evidence of their effectiveness exists. We propose the first longitudinal randomized controlled trial to evaluate the causal impact of a diversity program on applicant outcomes: students’ choices of courses and major, graduate study, career track, and pursuing research in economics. We randomize selection into the 2022 and 2023 cohorts of the program, admitting randomly selected students into the program from a pool of top applicants. We stratify on economic status and international / domestic student status, and balance across key demographic characteristics and education outcomes. Outcome data is tracked using several rounds of surveys and secondary data on educational and professional outcomes."
