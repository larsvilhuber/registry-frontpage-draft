abstract: "Financial literacy is an essential life skill that is found to be not adequate enough even among the adult population (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2014). Students often start their financially independent lives at the university, and therefore financial education becomes timely. Despite this, studies concerning tertiary education settings are scarce.  

In this study, we seek to fill this gap by an intervention that includes a new online freshman course of financial education tailored to the first-year students of the University of Vaasa. The aim of this course is to improve the financial management skills of the university students so that they would be able to conduct independent financial lives."
