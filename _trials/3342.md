abstract: "We design and conduct large-scale surveys and experiments in six countries to investigate how natives perceive immigrants and how perceptions influence their preferences for redistribution. We collect respondents’ detailed, quantitative perceptions about immigrants’ numbers, origins, religion, net benefits received, unemployment rate, poverty, and education. We compare these perceptions to reality and assess how accurate they are. We also ask detailed questions about support for various tax and transfer policies, social insurance, and migration policies. This allows us to study the correlation between perceptions of immigration and support for redistributive policies. In addition, we perform four randomized experimental treatments, to check that the correlations between immigration perceptions and policies are causal. We randomize the order of questions about immigration and about redistribution. We also experimentally show respondents information about the true i) number, ii) origin and iii) “hard work” of immigrants in their country. "
