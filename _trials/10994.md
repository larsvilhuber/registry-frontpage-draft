abstract: "This study examines whether volunteers provide more effort when they have more autonomy in choosing the volunteering task. In a natural field experiment, students of four public high schools in Albania will be asked to write awareness messages for one of the following causes: bullying, depression, and social inclusion of people with disabilities. Further, this study questions whether students will provide more effort because the choice allows them to raise awareness about the cause they like to support or whether it allows them to match their abilities with the task. Lastly, this study questions whether there are long-term effects of autonomy and whether autonomy can lead to more effort relative to the monetary compensation of volunteers. Treatments will vary in whether students will be allowed to choose the task or be matched with a random task, have their abilities matched with the task, and receive a large monetary reward for their effort.
