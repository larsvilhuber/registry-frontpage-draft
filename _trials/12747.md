abstract: "We conduct a large-scale tax message experiment with firms in Kampala, Uganda. For the experiment, we compiled a unique database by merging business tax information from the Uganda Revenue Authority and trade license information from the Kampala Capital City Authority. This novel database enables us to measure tax compliance in a multi-level tax system. Our sampling frame consists of 65,269 firms. These firms are allocated to a control group that does not receive a message, firms that receive a deterrence message either through KCCA or URA, firms that receive the message through both tax authorities, and firms that receive a message highlighting enforcement coordination between the tax authorities. We test whether (i) the effects of a prior message experiment persist four years post-intervention; (ii) the effects replicate after repeating the original intervention; (iii) the intervention shows different effects when applied to larger firms or previously non-compliant firms; (iv) the intervention shows similar effects when applied to local taxes paid by the same population of firms; and (v) whether treatment effects at one tax tier crowd out compliance at the other tier."
