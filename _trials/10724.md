abstract: "The dissemination of health-related fake news , especially on social media platforms, is a strong thread to the efficient provision of health care. Several media platforms have recently established tools to combat the spread of fake news. In this research project, we aim to assess the effectiveness of such tools, and elaborate on the underlying psychological mechanisms. Specifically, we will conduct an online survey experiment in six sub-Saharan African countries via Facebook to evaluate the impact of two kinds of such tools – a pre- and a debunking tool - on individuals’ sharing behavior. Moreover, our experimental set-up allows to shed light on the causal impact of confirmatory search behavior and article accuracy on the impact of these tools on people’s article sharing behavior. We consider two indicators of sharing behavior: (i) intentions (willingness to share) and (ii) action (clicking a Facebook sharing  button). Apart from the impacts of those tools, we plan to analyze differences in sharing behavior regarding sociodemographic factors, personality and risk aversion, prior health and vaccination attitudes and own health and vaccination history."
