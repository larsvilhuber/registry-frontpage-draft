abstract: "In many developing countries, the large-scale expansion of agricultural producers involves the acquisition of vast areas of land from traditional rural communities. Large-scale agricultural investments (LSAIs) may affect livelihoods positively or negatively. In this research project, we examine the consequences of LSAIs on social cohesion. We conduct household surveys and public good games with more than 2500 inhabitants from villages that are more or less affected by oil palm plantations in rural Indonesia. Before deciding how much to contribute to a public good, a randomly chosen subset is reminded of traditional institutions, the others receive a control prime. We investigate if social cohesion differs between villages that are more or less affected by oil palm plantations, and if dysfunctional traditional institutions drive this result. Furthermore, we look into migration history, ethnicity, and village elite membership."
