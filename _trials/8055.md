abstract: "Internal constraints such as lack of aspirations and hope have recently gathered a lot of attention as important factors for explaining poverty and inequality. Focusing on a cohort of primary school students in India, this project studies the role modelling effect of historical statues. In the process, we intend to shed light on the importance of familiarity and susceptability as key mechanisms that fuel such a motivational effect. "
