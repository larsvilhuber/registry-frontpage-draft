abstract: "Why do consumers' inflation expectations diverge so much from central banks' forecasts? Using new surveys, we provide evidence that German consumers perceive the ECB's inflation forecasts to be less accurate and more optimistic than they are. Using information experiments, we show that such beliefs are causally related to inflation expectations. Information about inflation forecasts also promotes trust in the ECB, which we measure directly with a generic question, and indirectly with a new six-item questionnaire. Communication is effective in changing beliefs about the credibility of the target, the honesty of the ECB, and the personal benefits of monetary policy."
