abstract: "This study randomizes the assignment of interviewers with different ethnic backgrounds to respondents in a nationwide telephone poll of 2000 residents of Ukraine, a multi-ethnic country. This will enable us to test whether respondents systematically self-represent their own identity as well as political views often associated with identity in a survey setting differently when interviewed by interviewers who have different identity traits likely to be discernible through speech (over the phone). The relevant interviewer traits are language of childhood (Russian and Ukrainian) and region where one primarily lived prior to age 14. The study will explore heterogeneity of effects across regions of Ukraine and communities of varying degrees of diversity."
