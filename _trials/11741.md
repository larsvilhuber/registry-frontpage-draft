abstract: "This project studies the economic impact of a certification program to avocado farmers in the Mount Kenya region. A large non-profit organization in the area allows farmers to get their Hass avocado crops certified ahead of the avocado season. Upon receiving certification, farmers enter into an agreement with the NGO, which ensures that the NGO will purchase their avocados at a higher price. The NGO then exports these Hass avocados to Europe. We partnered with this NGO to estimate the direct and indicret impact of this certification program. We are interested in estimating the differences in prices, revenue and profits between (i) farmers with and without certification, and (ii) uncertified farmers in areas with certification compared to those in areas without certification. We propose that the certification program could be boosting the earnings of all avocado growers in the Mount Kenya region - not solely those with certification. Our identification strategy relies on the fact that the latest expansion of the certification program was carried out randomly at the subcounty level.
