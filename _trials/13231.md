abstract: "Export-led growth has long been seen as a key to unlocking structural transformation. In pursuance of this goal, low-income country governments often enact policies to encourage firms to overcome barriers to exporting, such as subsidized credit designed to ease financial frictions. In this project, we propose one of the first randomized controlled trials of one such policy. We partner with Rwanda’s Ministry of Trade and Industry, as well as the Development Bank of Rwanda (BRD), to evaluate Rwanda’s Export Growth Fund (EGF), which provides large subsidized loans to exporters and potential exporters at preferential interest rates. We generate exogenous variation in loan take-up by partnering with the BRD to conduct a door-to-door campaign with randomly selected large and medium-sized firms, in which treated firms receive both promotional materials and application support from BRD staffers. Using a combination of unique administrative data access from the Rwandan Revenue Authority (RRA) and primary survey data collection, we measure the impact of the EGF on key firm performance outcomes, shed light on underlying mechanisms, and measure the aggregate economic effects of this policy"
