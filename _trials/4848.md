abstract: "We propose a form of threshold matching where donations above a certain threshold are topped up with a fixed amount. We show theoretically that threshold matching can induce crowding in if appropriately personalized. In a field experiment, we explore how thresholds should be chosen depending on past donations. Additionally, we explore how thresholds should be set for new donors as a function of their personal characteristics and compare personalization to setting general thresholds applying to all recipients of a fundraising call.
