abstract: "Do social concerns affect whether people pass on information? I run a RCT in rural Punjab to explore the willingness to pass on information about a new technology, mobile banking. The experiment offers people a chance to pass information on two types of information (consumer financial protection and advanced usages) to socially close community members and randomly-chosen community members. I randomize the amount of information revealed about a recommendation and then study information-passing choices. At the village-level, I randomize an SMS campaign with information on consumer financial protection and advanced usages. The results of the experiment will inform a model of information diffusion where potential information-sharers consider the effect of sharing on their relationship with social ties."
