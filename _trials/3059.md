abstract: "The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) sends a reminder letter to business taxpayers who have missed their tax debt due date. This trial evaluated the effect of varying the send date of the reminder letter. The target population is restricted to taxpayers with a history of compliant payment behaviour over at least the previous three years. The trial was conducted based on the 26th May 2017 Business Activity Statement (BAS) lodgment date. 4,787 unpaid debt cases were quarantined from the usual ATO treatment pathways. Debt cases were randomly allocated to receive a reminder letter in either the first, second, or third week following their missed tax debt due date; a control group did not receive a letter for the duration of the trial. An equal number of quarantined debt cases were randomly assigned to each of the treatment groups and to the control group. The outcomes of interest are: (1) the number of days since the tax debt due date until payment is received, including information on partial payments; and (2) details of any payment arrangements clients may have entered into during the trial."
