abstract: "Can monitoring by political parties induce their workers to expend greater effort in electoral campaigns? Through a large-scale field experiment in collaboration with a major political party in Pakistan, I test whether monitoring of political campaigns by the party can induce greater effort by the party's political workers during the campaign and bring about better electoral outcomes for the party."
