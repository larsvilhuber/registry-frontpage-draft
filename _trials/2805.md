abstract: "In this study, we will evaluate a study guidance intervention for secondary school students aimed at reducing drop-out from tertiary education by tackling information deficits concerning suitable study programs as well as fostering academic self-efficacy and developing a growth-mind-set. Professional study counselors will deliver the intervention within an intensive one-day study guidance workshop. We will implement a randomized trial at the individual level and study the effects of the workshop on incremental beliefs of intelligence/ability, self-efficacy, study intentions and study choice as well as on academic achievement and drop out from tertiary education. The empirical analysis will be based on experimental data gathered immediately before the intervention and at different time points after the intervention for up to three years. "
