abstract: "The South Alamo Regional Alliance for the Homeless (SARAH) is the lead agency empowered to prevent and end homelessness in the San Antonio/Bexar County (Texas) Continuum of Care. Together with the Wilson Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunities (LEO), SARAH has developed a simplified assessment tool to connect people experiencing homelessness to appropriate housing options and assistance. The tool replaces the current Vulnerability Index - Service Prioritization Decision Assistance Tool (VI-SPDAT) used in SARAHâ€™s Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) system. The research team will launch a randomized controlled trial evaluation to measure the impact of different prioritization rules on housing stability. The goal of the study is to serve 4,000 clients and randomize them equally inside HMIS into data-driven and case-worker-rating prioritization systems that operate on the same numerical scale. After receiving their score, a client will be placed on one central prioritization list for all clients. When new slots open up, clients will be drawn from this list in order of priority, with the most vulnerable clients offered services first. Outcomes measured in HMIS and administrative records will include housing stability, creditworthiness and use of credit, criminal justice involvement, employment, and income."
