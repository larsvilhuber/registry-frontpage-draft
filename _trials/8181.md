abstract: "Tax administrations have limited resources to ensure tax compliance, and thus it is important to use the tools they have in the right combination. Online cash registers were introduced in Hungary in 2013-2014, they are compulsory equipment in certain sectors and they communicate directly with the tax agency. With a series of experiments I investigate the effect of warning letters and local inspections in relation to online cash registers.
At the beginning of April, 2019 a randomized experiment was conducted with Hungarian taxpayers. Selected companies using online cash registers (OCRs) received a warning letter. The letter warned the reader to use the cash register for every sale they make as the agency is monitoring incoming data continuously and suspicious companies are selected for tax inspection. It was a novel approach for the tax administration to send this kind of reminder. Results showed that after receiving the letter, the number of receipts and turnover recorded by the cash registers temporarily increased. The increase was concentrated among taxpayers who did not give receipts during an earlier tax inspection. A series of experiments is planned to find out the best way to increase tax compliance among companies using online cash registers.
During the summer of 2021 a territorially concentrated tax inspection campaign was conducted in the vicinity of lake Balaton, which is a main tourist destination of Hungary during the summer. In the first phase during July several local tax investigations have been conducted. At the beginning of August warning letters have been sent out based on the results of the first phase in a randomised control trial to businesses around Balaton as well as to businesses around other lakes with touristic relevance in Hungary. For the second phase of the inspection campaign conducted during August businesses were selected for inspection in a randomised way and with regard to the results of the first phase of the campaign. The goal of the research is to find out how does a warning letter and a tax inspection compare in their effectiveness in increasing tax compliance and what is the best way to combine them."
