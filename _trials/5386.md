abstract: "In markets where the protection of intellectual property cannot be assured through legal enforcement mechanisms, organizations have to resort to norm-based compliance mechanisms. The question how to encourage compliance becomes especially interesting in settings where royalty payments contribute towards research and development in a sector's technological advancement. This is the case for the Argentinian agricultural sector and seed technology research. New seeds research is typically financed through a royalty scheme: farmers that re-use seeds in a subsequent agricultural season are asked to pay royalties on the amount of farm-produced seeds. These amounts are self-reported, not verifiable, and reporting cannot be enforced by law. Currently, less than 20% of farmers report re-planting and pay royalties. This is despite a seemingly wide-spread norm that condemns misreporting and thus piracy in agricultural seed R&D. With this project we test several alternative explanations that could drive piracy in agriculture. Specifically, we estimate the importance of attention and present bias, aversion towards private providers of R&D, and moral consistency. We conduct a randomized field experiment with the entire population of wheat and soybean farmers in Argentina and follow them over the course of one agricultural season."
