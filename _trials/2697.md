abstract: "This experiment will help to get a better understanding of how people value information. The research is to test whether people will pay for useless information and what kind of internal and external factors push them to do so. In this context, useless information is information that cannot beneficially inform future decisions. This study identifies the impact of effort investment in decision-making process and consumers' willingness to pay for the information."
