abstract: "In an online experiment, groups of 2, 3, 4, or 5 persons have to solve a complex task collectively while interacting in a video chat. The performance of the group determines the monetary payoff of its members. We first investigate how group size affects group performance. We also explore how group members' personal characteristics impact group performance. Moreover, after the group task we ask subjects to state which fellow group members were instrumental for group performance ("leaders"). Finally, we then investigate how leaders' personal characteristics correlate with them being perceived as leaders as well as with group success. "
