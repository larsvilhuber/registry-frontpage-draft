abstract: "Central banks regularly measure inflation expectations using density forecasts, in which respondents are asked to assign probabilities to pre-specified ranges of inflation. We test how stable these forecasts are if we introduce systematic changes to the scale used, such as shifting the whole scale or varying the number of bins. This experiment is a follow-up to an experiment conducted in December 2021 (see https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/8716). 

Participants are asked three questions on their inflation expectations taken from the New York Fedâ€™s SCE (including the density forecast). After each of these questions, participants state their certainty about their answer on a 6-point Likert scale. Afterwards, participants fill out a short demographic survey, containing questions on age, gender, US state of residence, education, political orientation, knowledge of the Fed inflation target, financial literacy and an attention check. Participants have the option to not answer these questions, if they prefer not to do so.

We run nine conditions with 100 new participants each, plus as many participants from the 2021 collection as possible. Our conditions comprise the unmodified density forecast from the New York SCE plus eight modifications to the scale. Participants that were part of the 2021 collection will be part of the same treatment again.
