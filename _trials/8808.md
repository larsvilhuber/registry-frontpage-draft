abstract: "Bhutan Ministry of Education, Ministry of Labor and Human Resources, and Asian Development Bank conduct an experiment to examine the effects of providing career mentoring to students who are about to decide their tertiary education after graduating from secondary school. Our treatment involves four one-to-one meetings between mentors who are TVET students or workers who graduated from TVET and upper secondary school students. These meetings provide students with information about the importance of TVET education, student life, labor market information and job prospects of TVET students, as well as entry requirements and application process to TVET institutes.
