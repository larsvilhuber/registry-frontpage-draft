abstract: "Teacher expectations, as literature in psychology has shown, can matter for a studentâ€™s performance by creating self-fulfilling prophecies, which is known as the Pygmalion Effect (Rosenthal & Jacobson, 1968, 1992). Using an experimental design, we aim to shed light on answering whether this hypothesized effect of teacher expectations can be harnessed to improve student effort, achievement and engagement, in a low-resource context, like Pakistan. As part of our treatment, teachers deliver statements conveying high expectations of effort to students. Using an experimental design, our study aims to shed light on whether: (a) expectations of high effort and achievement affect student performance and engagement; (b) the treatment effect differs according to whether these expectations are conveyed to a student individually or in a pair and (c) the treatment effect differs by gender. We will also analyze how the intervention affects student peer interactions."
