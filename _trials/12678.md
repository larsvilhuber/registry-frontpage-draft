abstract: "Independent contract work (including gig work) has increased in the 2000s (e.g. Collins et al. (2019); Katz and Krueger (2019a, 2019b); Abraham et al. (2020)). Such work may enable people to self-insure against income or expenditure shocks, but short-term contracts or gigs are also risky. For instance, there is uncertainty whether a suitable job is available when needed, and risks of (last-minute) job cancellations or hours being cut. Moreover, independent contractors are often excluded from unemployment insurance (UI), (employer-provided) health insurance and retirement programs, as well as occupational health and safety regulations, wage and hour laws. Thus, as regular employment contracts decrease, firms are insuring agents against risk less. This begs the question whether there is demand for (supplemental) risk mitigation, specifically of income risk. 

To answer this question we employ an RCT on a nationwide online labor market platform to estimate the demand for insurance against various types of income risk. Workers using the platform will be presented with a series of discrete choices between a job contract that offers less insurance and one that offers more insurance against a specific type of income risk. Workers are randomized into different insurance groups, each of which is presented with a different insurance option against a specific income risk. Workers are also randomized into different information treatment groups and different alternative insurance options groups. Worker choices will allow us to estimate the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) and willingness to pay (MRS) for income risk mitigation, across risk types, insurance levels and pay levels, the sensitivity of the MRS and WTP to changes in beliefs, and workersâ€™ willingness to trade-off flexibility for insurance."
