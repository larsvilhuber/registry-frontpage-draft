abstract: "We investigate elemental financial decisions such as "You can invest some money. Do you prefer to invest in a (safe) asset with 5% returns or in a (safe) asset with 10% returns, all else equal and no additional strings attached?" Such decisions are fundamental for all financial decisions, yet to the best of our knowledge they have not been investigated experimentally. We expect that people misallocate money, and that this misallocation increases with cognitive uncertainty. We try to manipulate misallocation by using framing, negative interest rates, the valence of the decision (investing vs. borrowing) and divisible vs. indivisible money - the three former UVs in a within design, the latter UV in a between design."
