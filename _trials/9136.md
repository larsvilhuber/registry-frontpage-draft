abstract: "This study aims to identify whether information provision about the costs of possessing and using a private car increases the willingness-to-pay for alternative modes of transportation or professional mobility advisory services. In a survey experiment among around 8,000 participants, we elicit the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for various sustainable mobility modes, such as e-scooters, e-bikes, pedelecs, e-cargo bikes and public transport, as well as for professional mobility advisory services in a revealed preference second price auction. In addition, we test if providing participants with information about the cost of their car ownership increases their WTP for the different transport modes and the professional mobility advisory services."
