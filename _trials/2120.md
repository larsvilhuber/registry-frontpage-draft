abstract: "This project focuses on impacts of social preferences on other-regarding risk preferences. In other words, this project will test whether people who care more about social welfare would show different other-regarding risk preferences, than those who care less about social welfare. On the other hand, this project also sheds light upon institutional effects on other-regarding risk preferences. That is, given one's social preferences whether s/he would show different other-regarding risk preferences under the two different institutions: one is where people self select to be decision maker of social risky decisions, the other situation is where people are all asked to make social risky decisions. Additionally, this project will explore whether social preferences influence the discrepancy between self- and other-regarding risk preferences. "
