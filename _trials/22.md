abstract: "The purpose of this study is to understand the determinants of men’s preferences for fertility and family planning. Surveys such as the Demographic and Health Surveys have shown that men in developing countries report a higher desired total fertility than their wives (Becker, 1999). However, little is known about what forces drive such preferences.  
A previous study “Intra-household Decision-making and Excess Fertility:  An Experimental Study of Concealable Contraceptives” conducted by this research team in Lusaka (Ashraf et al. 2009) assigned married women to receive a voucher, which guaranteed ease of access to a range of modern contraceptives, either alone or in the presence of their husbands. The study revealed that women who received the voucher alone were 23% more likely to visit a family planning nurse and 38% more likely to receive a concealable form of contraception than women who received the voucher in the presence of their husbands, leading to a 57% reduction in unwanted births 9-14 months later. This behavior was mainly observed among women who had lower desired number of children than their husbands.   
Discordant preferences in the ideal number of children seem thus to have an important effect on household decisions about family planning. Understanding where such differences originate can inform policy-makers who intend to implement family planning policies that target men, and ultimately can contribute to reducing women’s unmet need for contraceptives.  
This new study thus builds upon the findings of the previous study in attempting to understand the cause of, and potential trigger factors to impact, and differential fertility preferences among men and women.  The final study design that we are submitting with this proposal is the result of two years of exploratory research to refine both the research questions and the research/treatment design, so that the study results will be best suited to inform policy in a meaningful way."
