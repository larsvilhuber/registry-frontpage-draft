abstract: "In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, Italyâ€™s government ordered the closure of all schools and universities in the country. Educators were forced to rapidly adapt to online/ distance learning methods. At home, students from underprivileged backgrounds are less likely to have proper learning support. This inequality might increase existing learning gaps by socioeconomic characteristics. The intent of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention that provides individual online tutoring to students whose background does not allow them to properly follow learning activities during the school closure and in periods with in-person instruction. Specifically, the intervention randomly assign middle school students to a tutor -a volunteer college student- who provides online tutoring every week. We will evaluate the impact of the intervention in the short-term and long-term educational outcomes of students. In addition, we analyze impacts on socio-emotional skills, aspirations, and psychological well-being.

We run a pilot study in Spring 2020 and plan to scale up our efforts during the following academic years. 

Additionally, in the 2022-2023 academic year, we will randomly assign 50% of tutors to receive additional materials aimed at encouraging students to interpret potential negative feedback from teachers and peers in a constructive manner. The goal of this intervention is to help remedial children develop a positive self-representation, increase effort in school, and enhance motivation.
