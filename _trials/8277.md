abstract: "Tax penalty collection remains a significant problem that tax authorities must mitigate around the globe. Failure to identify and mitigate the tax penalty collection problem would result in revenue losses, higher operational costs due to additional steps that must be performed, and higher safety risks because of the escalation of the collection process. Significant strands of behavioural economics exploring tax compliance behaviour generally focus on regular payment and reporting accuracy and timeliness. However, delinquent taxes and penalty repayment and collection have been understudied. This research aims to fill the gap by conducting a field experiment using various behavioural messages to motivate taxpayers that have been issued tax penalties to pay their tax penalties promptly, especially in Indonesia as a developing country. A randomised controlled trial with three treatment arms consists of deterrence, information, and simplification messages will be performed in cooperation with the Indonesian tax authority, the Directorate General of Taxes of the Republic of Indonesia. This research will involve taxpayers registered at the district tax offices within four regional tax offices as possible. The research results are expected to provide meaningful insight for the tax authority in formulating their tax collection policy."
