abstract: "We will evaluate the effects of performance-based bonus pay on the quality of work done by contractors to improve building shell tightness in the Weatherization Assistance Program, the largest residential energy efficiency program in the United States.  In almost all WAP jobs, the measures contractors are asked to perform are chosen based on engineering calculations and quality control is done through an inspection process.  Because they are not compensated directly on the energy performance of the home, contractors lack an incentive to seek out and execute any additional cost effective measures that they find on site, such as air sealing.   We will evaluate whether performance-based bonus pay can result in cost effective improvements in the quality and quantity of air-sealing performed by contractors.  We will also examine the effects of performance incentives on work done by bonus-eligible contractors that is excluded from the bonus payment."
