abstract: "Organizations increasingly rely on digital platforms to post predefined challenges or problems, asking for members' submissions. Individuals can contribute directly when they post original ideas and solutions or indirectly when they give feedback to others' submissions. In general, a solution’s overall quality depends on individuals’ direct and indirect contributions. While research so far has primarily focused on the antecedents and outcomes of the former, very little is known about the drivers and consequences of individuals’ indirect contributions. We test whether granting individuals anonymity stimulates their feedback-giving behavior with regard to contributions by others. To do so, we run a field experiment with business school students on a digital platform that allows direct and indirect contributions of peers in the context of a hackathon. Our treatment takes place at the platform level and involves granting individuals anonymity in providing feedback to the solutions of others on the platform. We measure the quantity and valence of the feedback provided by participants, whether they incorporated the feedback received, and the quality of participants' final submissions."
