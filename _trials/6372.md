abstract: "
If the abilities of men and women are imperfectly observable, statistical gender discrimination in hiring may occur. In our experiment, we randomly match individuals (candidates) that have performed mathematical quizzes, in teams of two, and, subsequently, ask new subjects to evaluate a subset of the candidates’ individual performance based on information about pair performance. We vary the informativeness of an individual’s mathematical performance by ordering pair members either according to their score (First author treatment) or alphabetically (Alphabetical treatment). In this plan we describe hypotheses to be tested, the coding of variables, and the empirical strategy that will be used."
