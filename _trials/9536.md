abstract: "In a previous study, we examined how conditional cooperation is related to the material payoffs in a Sequential Prisoner’s Dilemma (SPD) experiment. We asked subjects to play eight SPDs with varying payoffs, systematically varying the material gain to the second-mover and the material loss to the first-mover in case the second-mover defects in response to cooperation. We find that few second-movers are conditionally cooperative in all eight games, and most second-movers change their strategies between games. Second-movers are less likely to conditionally cooperate when the gain is higher and when the loss is lower. This pattern is consistent with models of noisy decisions as well as distributional preferences. To further disentangle these potential explanations, we now plan to collect rich decision data in similar environments as above that allow us to independently estimate social preference parameters and decision noise."
