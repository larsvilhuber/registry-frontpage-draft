abstract: "The purpose of this project is to study how anchors affect estimations of subjective belief distributions (SBDs). Anchoring is a well-known judgment bias in decisions. Although the impact of anchors has been studied extensively on estimations of single-number summary statistics, its impact on higher moments of SBDs is to a large extent unexplored. This makes it valuable to study since SBDs play an important role in economic theory.

A second study using a number input interface is conducted for robustness check."
