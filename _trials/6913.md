abstract: "The school closures induced by the COVID-19 outbreak has placed heightened emphasis on alternative ways to measure and track student learning besides in-person assessments. A potential option to assess students remotely is phone-based assessments, where an assessor calls students, and asks them to solve some questions remotely. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has not yet been a formal validation of these learning assessments, where the scores obtained over the phone are correlated with the same studentsâ€™ classroom scores or other measures of achievement. It is also unclear whether these correlations hold up across sub-groups of interests like by gender, baseline performance, grade, or different degrees of rurality of each school -which may be particularly important for access to technology. Furthermore, important survey features such as whether there are strong enumerator effects in this type of assessment is also unknown for this type of assessment. We leverage the full random assignment of assessors to primary school children in Kenya to validate this type of assessment, and understand the extent to which enumerator effects explain part of the variance in outcomes recorded.
