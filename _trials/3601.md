abstract: "In many countries, gender inequalities begin at a young age and influence individuals’ long-term trajectories. In particular, social norms can lead to girls dropping out of school, marrying, and having children early in life. Women with less education may then experience reduced empowerment and limited job opportunities. In turn, this can create a cycle of gender inequality: participating less in the labor force may increase economic dependence on men, and strengthen the social norms that contribute to women dropping out of school. In such a context, we aim to measure the impact of two different interventions on women's empowerment: 1) local “adolescent development clubs” designed to provide young adolescents girls who dropped out of school with life skills trainings (“Espaces Sûrs” program); 2) an information campaign designed to change gender-related social norms among young men (“Clubs des Futurs Maris” program)."
