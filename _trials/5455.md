abstract: "Many of the female workers at Shahi Exports, our industry partner, are rural migrants who move temporarily to the city due to financial distress in their villages. According to our exploratory research and baseline data, they tend to remit a large share (close to 50%) of their wages back home. The standard modus operandi is to cash out their salary from their bank account and transfer the money through over-the-counter agent/shopkeeper services (92% of our sample at baseline). By saving time and money, digital payment services have the potential to improve their financial wellbeing.

While these workers are aware of the existence of digital payment platforms, our scoping work and baseline data showed that they do no know how to use digital payment apps and are wary of losing money on these platforms (i.e., the level of trust in digital transfer technology is low). In addition to this, workers face other issues that prevent them from signing up for and using digital payment applications. 

In this context, the research studies the impact of training female migrant workers in India to use digital payment applications. Our team, a collaboration between Good Business Lab and IDinsight, in conjunction with Shahi Exports, designed a randomized controlled trial that studies the effect of a workplace intervention -- training sessions to use a digital payments application -- on take-up and use of digital payment applications. The study sample size is 819 migrant women, randomized at the individual level, and split equally across three experimental arms. 

We are interested in studying the extent to which training programs of differing intensities may be effective and cost-efficient in improving take-up.
