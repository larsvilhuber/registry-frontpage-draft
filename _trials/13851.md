abstract: "We evaluate an intervention to raise application rates to RTE quota seats (under Clause 12(1)(c)) in Chhattisgarh. There are four distinct experiments. The treatment/interventions are the same, but they are conducted in different samples: Urban areas, disadvantaged rural areas, rural areas with under subscription, and "representative" or "typical" rural areas. Within each experimental group/sample, we first conducted an informational treatment. We randomly assigned communities to receive information about the RTE quota and the application process. In the second stage, we have a household-level randomized treatment that provides assistance in applying for the quote. Our main outcome is RTE quote application rates. Secondary outcomes are private school enrollment rates and learning outcomes."
