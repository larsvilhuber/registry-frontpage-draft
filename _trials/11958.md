abstract: "This study investigates the effects of news coverage about inflation on consumersâ€™ inflation expectations in 30 European countries between 2017 and 2023. Specifically, we use a randomized controlled trial to test whether sensational headlines (i.e., those mentioning that inflation or prices have reached a milestone, broken some historical record, or surpassed some round-number threshold) are more likely to i) attract consumers' attention and ii) lead consumers to expect increasing inflation."
