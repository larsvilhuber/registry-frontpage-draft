abstract: "We study the extent author affiliation can bias reviewers in grading papers submitted to international conferences. We exploit a PhD Workshop in Economics arranged by local PhD candidates. Our objective is to investigate the extent to which author affiliation can introduce bias in the evaluation of research papers. Affiliation is often used as a signal to form beliefs about research quality (Blank 1991). We test whether signals can potentially be misinterpreted and exacerbate inequalities across researchers from differently ranked institutions. We will compare blind and non-blind assessments for each paper submitted to the conference. "
