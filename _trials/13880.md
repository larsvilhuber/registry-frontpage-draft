abstract: " We propose to study how risk information about HIV should be presented in order to maximize its effect on beliefs about HIV for longer periods.  In our baseline experiment, we will provide a random sample of participants with quantitative (statistical) risk information about the national new HIV infections and the attendance rates at a local clinic for HIV testing. For the remaining participants, we will complement this statistical information with a story, that is a qualitative narrative explaining how someone overcame the fear and anxiety to get tested after an ex-partner tested positive for HIV. The story also informs the reader about the testing experience  at a local clinic. We will give all participants vouchers for HIV tests. This experimental design will allow us to estimate the effect of stories on the evolution of beliefs about HIV. Next, we will estimate the effect of stories on recall of the statistical information received two weeks after information is delivered. Lastly, We will estimate the effect of stories on voucher take-up intentions and actual HIV tests conducted at the clinic."
