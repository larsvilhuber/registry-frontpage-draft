abstract: "While standard models of technology adoption posit learning as the basis of behavior change, information campaigns in public health frequently fail to change behavior. We design a scalable information campaign embedding hand-hygiene edutainment within popular dramas using mobile phones, randomly distributed to poor households in rural Bangladesh. We measure changes in hygiene knowledge, behavior, and child health, and use machine learning techniques with minute-level data on edutainment exposure and handwashing to better understand the patterns of information exposure that may translate to behavior change.
