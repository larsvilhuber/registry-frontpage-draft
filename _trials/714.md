abstract: "This study will add to the body of research on incentive-induced behavior by quantifying the effect of various incentives on output. While a wide range of incentives have been shown to be effective (see Campbell, 2006), comparisons between different incentive types have been rare. This study hopes to quantify some of the difference between types of incentives, particularly in non-monetary forms (such as goal setting, comparison to others, etc.). The result of this study will form the basis for the elicitation of expert forecasts as registered in "Expert Forecasts of Amazon Turk Treatments" (AEARCTR-0000731). "
