abstract: "Evidence from recent studies shows that people have different perceptions on who are the winners and the losers of the redistribution policies and on the notion of what is fair. These different views crucially affect people’s preferences for redistribution policies.

We conduct an online survey in Spain to clarify how perceptions on intergenerational mobility affects preferences for redistribution. We follow the framework and the questionnaire of Alesina et al. (2018), with minor modifications, and mainly aim to contribute to the existing literature by adding a new country case. The randomised treatment is built on two animations indicating low intergenerational mobility.

In addition to causal inference design, we do also provide some stylised facts on the gap between reality and perceptions, i.e. misperceptions, on personal and household income positions in society and correlations between the misperceptions and policy preferences.

For the details of randomisation strategy and key questions for our study, please see the Supporting Documents and Materials, which is available upon request (by clicking the button).
