abstract: "Cooperation among employees is one of the most important pillars for company success. A common practice to foster a cooperative culture among employees is to provide monetary incentives to cooperate. For example, through managers or institutional arrangements that allocate monetary rewards to more cooperative employees. However, economic theory as well as empirical evidence suggest that such incentive choices can induce unintended side effects. In the economic literature on cooperation it has been emphasized that incentive choices can signal bad (or good) news about the prevalence of uncooperative individuals in a population. As a consequence, incentives can have limited or even counterproductive effects on cooperative behavior. Do incentive choices work as information devices in a natural environment, namely, in a company that wants to foster cooperation? And what are the implications for the company’s efforts? The pre-analysis plan that I upload here outlines hypotheses and planned analyses of a fully-incentivized online experiment with about 50 managers and 350-400 employees from a large company. It focuses on the information effects induced by managers’ incentive choices on the cooperation culture among employees measured in an online public good game experiment.
