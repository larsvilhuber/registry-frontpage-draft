abstract: "We design an experiment to assess the relative effectiveness of human mentors versus AI-powered chatbots in motivating students to pursue a teaching career in Chile. We work with Elige Educar, a Chilean NGO that implements a mentoring program for students interested in education or related fields. Participating high school students are randomly assigned to one of three groups: a group that re- ceives support from a human mentor via WhatsApp; a group that receives support from an AI-powered chatbot, also through WhatsApp; and a passive control group that receives no support. We assess the effectiveness of each treatment in motivating students to register for an education major through Chile’s centralized university admissions process. Beyond addressing Chile’s immediate teacher recruitment challenges, the study contributes to the emerging research on AI in education by empirically assessing the potential of generative AI to provide personalized, scalable mentoring."
