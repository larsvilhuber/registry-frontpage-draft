abstract: "The City of Los Angeles has 16 WorkSource Centers that serve approximately 30,000 residents per year with the ultimate goal of connecting them to meaningful employment and occupational training. The WorkSource Centers achieve this by providing clients free employment services such as career guidance, resume and interview skill building, and employment referrals.Of WorkSource Center clients, around 80% are low income, 80% are people of color, and 40% experience other barriers to employment such as being homeless, justice involved, or substance abuse issues.This randomized experiment evaluates the effect of sending WorkSource Center clients regular communications via text message on client engagement, persistence, and employment and training outcomes.
