abstract: "The objective of this study is to determine whether Cause-focused promotional messages, compared to Product-focused promotional messages, promote the purchasing behavior of services supporting environmental conservation sold by non-profit organizations. Additionally, we aim to explore how differences in messaging affect consumer behavior related to these services. To examine the effects of Cause-focused messages, we will conduct a field experiment at the Oki Islands UNESCO Global Geopark in Shimane Prefecture, utilizing services sold by the GeoPark administrators to support environmental conservation activities.

The services targeted in this study consist of three components: a commemorative card that purchasers can print with their own photos, an exclusive application to participate in missions (e.g., quizzes about local sights) around the island, and commemorative goods given to mission completers (e.g., limited cards or stickers that teach about the natural and cultural aspects of Oki). By purchasing these services, 50% of the purchase price will support the environmental conservation activities conducted by local high school students, allowing visitors to contribute to the preservation of Okiâ€™s environment.

Visitors will need to operate a touchscreen vending machine to purchase these services, and we will use the service explanation screens displayed during this operation as our intervention tool. The experiment will use two types of service explanation screens developed based on promotional methods verified in the context of Cause-Related Marketing. The first screen, Product-focused, emphasizes service details with images and text, while the use of environmental conservation funds is described solely with text. The second screen, Cause-focused, emphasizes the use of environmental conservation funds with images and text while detailing the service with text alone. These screens will be randomly displayed, dividing potential consumers into two groups based on which screen they see: the Product-focused group (control group) and the Cause-focused group (treatment group).

Through a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we will examine whether Cause-focused messages reduce the dropout rate at the service explanation screen and increase the purchase rate of services supporting environmental conservation compared to Product-focused messages. Additionally, we will exploratively analyze whether trends in consumer behavior differ between the two groups by focusing on usage patterns in the application (e.g., number of missions completed) and survey results (e.g., satisfaction with service, perceived value, environmental awareness).

Note: This study was conducted similarly in another region as cited below. Although registered as a separate RCT due to differences in implementation periods and service content, the intervention methods and hypotheses remain consistent.
