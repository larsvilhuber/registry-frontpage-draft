abstract: "What are the determinants of demand for professional development in public administration, and can that demand be changed? This study will assess the ability of an external intervention to influence the demand for management continuous professional development in the public sector. We will measure the willingness to pay for 1) an executive education course, 2) professional coaching and, 3) a shadowing opportunity among professional higher education students at the Civil Service University in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We test how narrative-based ‘edutainment’ videos showcasing the professional success of middle managers can alter demand for professional development, a key element in efforts to improve civil service capabilities.
