abstract: "Background: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is commonly used in diagnosis and treatment of biliary and pancreatic disorders. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of OB use during ERCP on duodenal motility, the tolerability of the procedure (by patients) and the difficulty of the procedure (by the endoscopist).


Method: The study was enrolled in Konya Training and Research Hospital General Surgery Endoscopy Unit in randomized prospective pattern. The patients were divided into two groups as spasmolytic and control groups. The procedure was performed under topical anesthesia and sedation. 

Results: There were 100 cases included into the study (50 cases in each group). The mean duodenal motility score was found to be 1.9 ± 0.5 in the study group and 3 ±0.6 in the control group. In the study group, the tolerability of the procedure score by the endoscopist was moderate in 16% and well/very well in 78% of the cases. On the other hand, in the control group, the scores were poor in 21%, moderate in 71% and well /very well in 24% of the cases. In terms of patient satisfaction, in study group 42% of the cases reported the procedure as moderate and 58% reported as well/very well. However, in the control group 16% of the cases reported the procedure as poor, 58% moderate and 26% as well/very well.

Conclusion: Otilonium bromide is a safe agent with low side effects. It can be used before the ERCP procedure to decrease the duodenal motility. It eases the procedure, moreover, it increases the patients’ satisfaction.
