abstract: "Previous experiments show that (even slight) differences in the design of invitation letters result in significant differences of starting rates between the respective groups. Typically, these studies rely on static experimental groups and inference that allows to determine the best performing invitation letter only ex-post. Trading off exploration and exploitation, we apply a reinforcement learning method in an adaptive experiment, as proposed by Scott (2010). Using multi-armed bandit optimization, specifically Thompson Sampling, we may compare a substantially larger set of alternatives. We show how Thomson Sampling can be implemented in the context of survey research conducted by the German Business Panel (GBP) and how accurate inference can be drawn. We aim to identify the distinct elements of a corporate web survey invitation letter that maximize survey starting rates."
