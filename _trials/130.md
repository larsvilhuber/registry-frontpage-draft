abstract: "Small-scale farming continues to be the principal source of nutrition, employment and income for a majority of the population in developing countries. A large literature has documented the frequent absences of small scale farmers from their own field during the cropping season to engage in short-term "ganyu" labor outside of their households. Qualitative evidence suggests that the observed labor supply off-farm is neither planned nor desired by household, but rather a coping strategy employed by financially distressed households to overcome short-term credit constraints. However, research on the relationship between short-term credit constraints and labor supply is scarce. To identify the causal impact of short-term constraints on agricultural productivity through farms’ labor supply, we propose to conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial, which will provide selected households with access to maize loans during the farming season. In the first year of the study, loan programs will be announced after cropping decisions are made. This will allow us to isolate short-run adjustment on the labor supply margin, and any resulting impact on agricultural productivity. During the second year of the study, the loans will be announced to a subset of farmers before cropping decisions are made. This will allow us to measure the combined effect of adjustments in the overall production plans as well as in the short-term labor allocation. In order to distinguish credit supply from basic income effects, income transfers corresponding to the net value of the credits will be made to a subgroup of farmers. We will also provide cash loans to a selected group of farmers to measure the impact of the in-kind nature of the loan programs on uptake, repayment, resource allocation, productivity and harvest outcomes. The tested interventions are easily scalable, and, if successful likely to be implemented both by government and non-government agencies."
