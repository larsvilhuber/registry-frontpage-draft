abstract: "The labor productivity gap between men and women is a widespread phenomenon and seems to persist along the whole wage distribution. In developing countries, this gap is particularly pronounced both in urban and rural settings. Even though the literature has given increasing attention to this issue, it has partly neglected the psychological dimension that could contribute widening this gap. Under this perspective, women risk being more disadvantaged than men because of mental load, the management underlying household activities. This burden is mostly carried by women, and it may have harmful effects on their health, their labor productivity and, more broadly, their empowerment. Following the recent literature on scarcity, according to which poverty negatively impacts cognitive functions and economic outcomes, the aim of this study is to analyze the gender-differentiated impact of mental load on labor productivity controlling for attentional constraints as leading mechanism. To test for this hypothesis, we propose a lab-in-the-field-experiment where participants will be exposed to a scenario inducing thoughts about mental load, and then they will be asked to perform an effort task.
