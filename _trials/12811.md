abstract: "The equitable provision of effective after-school tutoring is crucial for fostering the accumulation of human capital in children. This study utilizes data from a randomized controlled trial conducted in China to explore the impact of after-school tutoring, facilitated by school teachers, on the development of children’s human capital. Our findings indicate that tutoring provided by teachers not only enhances the math scores of students in the treatment group by 0.134 standard deviations but also contributes to a 0.116 standard deviation increase in their non-cognitive abilities, particular in terms of conscientiousness. Notably, the positive effect on math score improvement is more pronounced among students with initially lower abilities. Through mechanism analysis, we identify the enhancement of children’s learning engagement and increased parental involvement as key channels through which the tutoring intervention bolsters human capital development in students. Further analysis reveals that school-provided tutoring additionally serves to reduce the expenditure of families on private tutoring services."
