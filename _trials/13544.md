abstract: "We analyze more than 6000 research articles published in top 104 peer-reviewed economics journals between October 2020 to March 2021 and document the co-authorship trends. We next conduct a survey with a randomly selected group of researchers (intended sample size of 250) to understand the underlying mechanisms driving such observed research strategies. "
