abstract: "Paternalism, or interventions in others’ freedom to advance their own welfare, is at the center of a long-standing debate in philosophy, politics, medicine, and other fields. Recently, researchers started to experimentally investigate when and why individuals are willing to intervene in others’ autonomy. A so far largely unexplored area in this line of research concerns the question of whether the willingness to intervene in others’ freedom depends on the personal traits and characteristics of the decision maker.

The aim  of this study is to shed light on this question and to learn whether and in what circumstances individuals act paternalistically, depending on the (perceived) rationality of decision-makers. We design a controlled online experiment to study our research questions.
