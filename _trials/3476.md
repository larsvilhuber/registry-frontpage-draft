abstract: "There is a general consensus among economists that carbon pricing represents the most cost-effective way to tackle climate change. Yet, only a relatively limited number of jurisdictions have implemented either a carbon tax or a carbon trading scheme. Most often, the main barrier to the implementation of carbon taxes is lack of public support. The literature in economics and other disciplines has pointed to information asymmetries driving this shortfall in public support. People tend to underestimate the benefits of carbon taxes and their incentive effect, and overestimate their drawbacks. Since people underestimate the effectiveness of carbon taxes, earmarking revenues for additional abatement tends to be relatively popular. Public ballots on carbon taxes are rare. We are aware of only three instances in which people voted on a carbon tax: in 2000 and 2015 (both times in Switzerland) and in 2016 (in Washington State). Inference in the literature is based on population surveys or lab experiments. No carbon tax has so far been accepted at the ballot box. In November 2018, for the second time in two years, the population of Washington State will be asked to vote on a carbon tax proposal (Initiative 1631). We plan to combine a population survey, measuring peopleâ€™s preferences for the 2016 and 2018 carbon tax designs, with field interventions, providing valuable information about the functioning of carbon taxes and the design of Initiative 1631 to a randomly selected number of precincts."
