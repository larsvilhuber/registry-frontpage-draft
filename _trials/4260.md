abstract: "The city of Cape Town suffered a severe water crisis in 2018. At the peak of the drought in South Africaâ€™s Western Cape, a randomised control trial over four months at 105 schools investigated the impact of two behavioural interventions to encourage responsible water usage: feedback in the form of detailed and customised water usage data from smart meters, and an interschool competition. Difference-in-differences analysis showed that the interventions reduced water usage in these schools by 16 to 27%. The information feedback was found to be more effective in reducing night time water use, indicating better water usage by the staff, while the competition was found to be more effective during the day time, indicating better water usage by the pupils. The contrast highlights the way feedback signalling was understood differently by the two groups, with different effects on their assumption of responsibility. This example from Cape Town schools demonstrates the effectiveness of combining smart technologies with behavioural insights and nudges. It provides a model of water conservation interventions for sustainable cities."
