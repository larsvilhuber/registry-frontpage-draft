abstract: "We use a randomized control trial within an online survey to test causally for a set of non-mutually-exclusive channels through which diversity in policy committees might affect economic outcomes through consumers’ beliefs and choices. Specifically, we study how the salience of the presence of underrepresented demographic groups on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) affects the expectations, beliefs, and choices of different demographics of the US population. We use a set of information treatments regarding recent forecasts of macroeconomic variables by the FOMC, in which we vary the information regarding the identity of FOMC members, by making more or less salient the presence of underrepresented demographic groups in the FOMC. As this salience varies, we test how different demographic groups process the same information about the FOMC’s forecasts, the effects of this information on economic expectations, and the extent to which  respondents trust the forecasts and policies the FOMC proposes. We also test whether the salience of demographic representation influences respondents’ choice of  reading news about the FOMC versus another policy institution. "
