abstract: "The recent surge in income and wealth inequality has rekindled the public and economic debates about the causes and consequences of inequality. While inequality is to some extent inevitable, its acceptance critically hinges on individuals’ views about the fairness of inequality. An important aspect of individuals’ tolerance for inequality is their perception of social mobility. If people believe that they face ex-ante equal prospects and that they can move up the social ladder, they may be willing to accept more inequality.
In this project, we investigate the relationship between intergenerational mobility and distributional preferences, which are key inputs into social policy measures and individual decision‐making. We implemented a survey module in a representative panel study of Germans. This survey module allows us to present a randomly selected subgroup information about actual mobility rates in Germany and subsequently measure participants’ distributional preferences in an incentivized way."
