abstract: "This study investigates three determinants of fertility in Burkina Faso: access to contraception, infant mortality perceptions, and social norms about family size. The study does so through household- and village-level interventions that provide free access to contraception at local health clinics; provide information on the area's level and recent trend in child mortality; engage villages in debates about family size norms and contraception; show an "edutainment" film that covers similar topics as discussed in the debates."
