abstract: "This study examines how individuals assess the direct and indirect consequences of comprehensive pricing for parking spaces in German cities and how public approval of such a policy is related to these assessments. In a survey experiment, we propose a policy on comprehensive parking fees and elicit the participants’ acceptance of this policy as well as their beliefs regarding its indirect effects, namely, the behavioral changes of others in response to this policy.
