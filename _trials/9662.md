abstract: "Rainfall and temperature variability induced by climate change pose a substantial economic risk to smallholder dairy farmers in developing countries (Tadesse and Dereje 2018). Rainwater harvesting tanks may help farmers adapt to climate uncertainty. Previous work has found that Asset Collateralized Loans (ACLs) help farmers purchase water tanks in Kenya (Jack et al, 2023). This study aims to validate past work and evaluate the impact of ACLs for water tanks on economic and household outcomes among dairy farmers in Kenya, with a focus on climate resilience. The study will also test an alternative loan design in which required monthly payments are a function of milk income, which may be better adapted to farmers with seasonally variable income. "
