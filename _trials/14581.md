abstract: "In a study involving employees from multiple supermarket stores within a German retail company, a randomly selected subset of employees will be informed about the descriptive norms of absenteeism in the organization. Employees with notably high absence rates will receive a letter comparing their absence level to the company median. We hypothesize that this intervention will reduce absenteeism not related to illness."
