abstract: "In many rural areas in Africa, staple food prices display predictable, sizeable price changes over the year, from post-harvest troughs to lean season peaks. We experimentally evaluate a group-based storage scheme with 139 treatment and control savings clubs in Kenya, designed to enable farmers to take advantage of these intertemporal price gains by storing maize after harvest. Treatment clubs were offered a savings product in which farmers could deposit a fraction of their harvest into a communal storage account, to be sold later in the season. We find that 58% of farmers took up the scheme, and that treatment farmers were 7-23 percentage points more likely to store maize for the hungry season and stored about 10% more maize than control farmers. We find that the vast majority of this maize was sold, leading to large effects on sales: treatment farmers were about twice as likely to sell maize. Finally, farmers realized gains from arbitrage â€“ conditional on selling, the average sale by a treatment farmer was a month later than that of a control farmer, and was made at a 5 percent higher price."
