abstract: "This document describes the pre-analysis plan for a field experiment evaluating the effective-ness of civil society campaigns in shaping election outcomes. This field experiment will be embedded in the Facebook advertising campaign of a German civil society organization dur- ing the run-up to three state elections in Germany in autumn of 2019. The main objective of this field experiment is to test the hypothesis whether civil-society organization can shape elec- tion outcomes via online campaigns. To pursue this objective, we design a randomized field experiment which experimentally varies which postal districts in these three states are exposed to the organization’s Facebook campaign and which are not. In this document we describe the motivation for conducting this experiment, the data and experimental design as well as our main hypotheses and the corresponding empirical analyses."
