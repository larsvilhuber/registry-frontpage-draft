abstract: "Influenza vaccination is important as it can reduce the risk of not only getting, but also spreading influenza. We evaluated how self-reported regret for not having gotten an influenza vaccination depends on individual preferences and information about the importance of vaccines. We run a 3-arm RCT providing either no information, information about the importance of vaccines to reach herd immunity or the possible importance of influenza vaccination regarding COVID-19. The RCT is embedded in a survey conducted on the employees of the University of Zurich, collecting demographic data, self-reported economic preferences, and beliefs about vaccinations and the medical sector."
