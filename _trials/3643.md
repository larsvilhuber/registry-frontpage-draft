abstract: "The study comprises a field experiment using gamification in order to encourage individuals to consume food in a more climate-friendly way. The digital game-app Carbonia features collaborative social interaction mechanisms and is played among university friends. We aim to analyze how the game interacts with the structural evolution of the friendship network of the participants and the network mechanisms that influence dietary choices.

Given that the reduction of meat and dairy products is seen as an important part of climate mitigation activities necessary to achieve the 2-degree climate target (e.g. Bryngelsson et al., 2016; Girod et al., 2014), private food choices can actively contribute to climate change mitigation efforts.
