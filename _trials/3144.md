abstract: "With the increasing individualization and insecurity of the Dutch pension system, the responsibility for a sufficient pension lies more and more with the pension fund participant. In order to make a decision on whether future pension benefits are sufficient or whether to take additional measures to save for retirement, participants need to have accurate information on the status quo. However, interest in pension communication has been found to be low. Through an experiment where different types of financial incentives are promised and paid out between treatment groups, we will analyse which financial incentive is most effective in increasing pension awareness. Our main dependent variables are whether participants log in to their personal space on the pension fundâ€™s website and whether they click on the pension planner (a page where they can see how much pension they have accrued at retirement). Furthermore, we are able to see whether different groups of participants react differently to treatments and whether the behavior on the website changes per treatment. "
