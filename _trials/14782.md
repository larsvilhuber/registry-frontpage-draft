abstract: "Unemployment and a lack of formal jobs continue to be to be major challenges in developing countries. At the same time, digital transformation is creating a need for more individuals with advanced digital skills. In this context, online training programs emerge as a potential solution, offering scalable short-term training in technical and socio-emotional skills. This paper aims to investigate the causal impacts of the Empleabilidad Digital program, which provided free scholarships for online technology-related courses to unemployed individuals and jobseekers in Peru. To do so, we utilize an individual-level randomized controlled trial, which was embedded during the applications to the program.

To assess the impacts of the program, we will use government administrative records merged with our experimental sample. Specifically, we will use the Planilla Electr√≥nica (PE), the Peruvian matched employer-employee dataset. The PE is a document that all formal firms in Peru with more than two workers are required to submit. Access to information from the PE is restricted and has been granted with express authorization from the Ministry of Labor and Promotion of Employment to identify the effects of the Empleabilidad Digital program on formal labor market indicators."
