abstract: "Early childhood programs impact test scores, but do they affect brain activity, and how do such neural changes impact future skills? To study these questions, we use a field experiment that randomized children to preschool or to a control group for one year. Following the intervention, we collect data on childrenâ€™s neural activity during academic and executive functioning tasks using electroencephalography (EEG)."
