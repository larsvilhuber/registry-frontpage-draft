abstract: "A central factor when choosing an action is its causal effect on outcomes we care about. Yet, for many decisions, only observational data are available. While experts often provide causal interpretations and recommendations for action, they frequently disagree. We use a laboratory experiment to study how humans choose in such settings. Our results inform the nascent literature on narrative competition and on model persuasion."
