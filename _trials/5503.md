abstract: "This experiment studies how experimentation incentives are shaped by our strategic environment. In particular, this study looks at incentives for experimentation in a laboratory experiment where a successful breakthrough represents a public good, as in Bonatti and Hörner (2011). Varying the observability of experimentation effort as well as whether experimentation is strategic, I investigate how experimentation in collaborative team projects is encouraged. The aim is to further test the theory's underlying assumptions that i) people respond to the information revealed by others’ actions in a manner consistent with Bayesian updating and ii) strategically consider the effect of their actions on others’ beliefs. This project furthermore examines how behavioral motives, such as reciprocity, drive behavior in the context of strategic experimentation. "
