abstract: "How does price and travel cost affect demand for clean energy? We introduce random variation in the price of liquid petroleum gas through household level subsidies that vary in the location where they can be redeemed. We follow households for six months and observe the demand response to subsidies and location. We will combine reduced form estimates with a discrete choice model to assess how the bundled value of a trip contributes to estimates of demand that rely on distance or travel cost to asses willingness to pay. In addition, we examine demand spillovers via social networks.
