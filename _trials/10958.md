abstract: "We study the effects of the Seoul Safety Income Project (SSIP) on labor market outcomes, household finance, health, education and societal behavior. In collaboration with the Seoul Metropolitan Government (SMG), we conduct a randomized controlled trial in which randomly selected households will receive a monthly income payment for three years. Monthly payments are equivalent to 50% of the difference between the householdâ€™s income and 85% of the median income. We will evaluate the impact of SSIP using detailed individual and household level information obtained from surveys and administrative data."
