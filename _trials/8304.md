abstract: "Despite a significant rollout of the electric grid, electricity usage among household and micro-enterprises in rural Rwanda remains low. This project seeks to answer if the benefits of on-grid electrification can be maximized by the availability of complementary inputs. Specifically, we study how one-time grants for micro-enterprises can stimulate appliance investments, electricity consumption, and business creation and performance. We partner with the Rwandan Ministry of Infrastructure to randomly assign the Business Development Services on the village level. We will look at the direct impact on grant applicants and communities by comparing outcomes between communities with and without access to grants after approximately one year. We will also assess spillovers on non-beneficiary households and microenterprises. "
