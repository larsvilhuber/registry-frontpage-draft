abstract: "This project investigates if election and referendum outcomes are distorted due to some voters casting their vote despite being uninformed. A game-theoretic model with rational agents shows that the voters in a society who have the lowest cost of getting informed about candidates or alternatives in an election or referendum should acquire the information and vote. Citizens who have higher information acquisition cost should not get informed and abstain from voting (if voting is not compulsory). Anecdotal evidence suggests that many people vote without being properly informed (e.g. spike in google searches for “what is Brexit?” after the referendum in the UK). Uninformed voting reduces the likelihood that the actually preferred alternative in a referendum or their preferred candidate/party in a general election is chosen. Hence, uninformed voting is a threat to the efficiency of the democratic process.This study uses the Amazon Turk platform to investigate if the phenomenon of uninformed voting is sizable. Treatment variations are designed in order to identify the mechanisms causing the phenomenon and to evaluate their relative importance."
