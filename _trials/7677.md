abstract: " We study whether the gender of co-workers matters for information exchange and performance in teams. We carried out a lab-in-the-field experiment where `test-takers’ were randomly assigned `helpers’. Helper allocation was randomized on two dimensions: (1) gender and (2) test-taker preference for that helper at baseline. To directly investigate frictions in information exchange, we cross-randomized the availability of hints to help with the task."
