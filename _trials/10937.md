abstract: "Female entrepreneurs face multiple challenges that constrain their ability to grow their businesses. For example, in developing countries like Pakistan, with unprogressive social norms, women face challenges such as lack of mobility, market access, capital, skills, information, social networks, etc. As a result, women-run firms are usually informal, small-scale, and operate from home. Given this context, I aim to explore whether networking skills and network access help small-scale female business owners have better business outcomes. Moreover, I study why women do not form networks with other self-employed women on their own. I focus on two potential reasons: the need for family support to interact with people outside the home and competition with other small-scale female business owners. I also study whether these preferences differentially vary by loan growth, confidence, and trust levels. I use a randomized evaluation strategy and embed an experiment within phone surveys. I prime respondents in the two treatment groups to increase the salience of family support/involvement in business discussions or competition and then measure the impact on their preference for networking with other self-employed women."
