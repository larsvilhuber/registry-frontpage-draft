abstract: "Forsa is a new economic inclusion program offered by the government of the Arab Republic of Egypt. Forsa beneficiaries, primarily drawn from the pool of current beneficiaries of the Takaful cash transfer program, will receive training and support to either enter wage employment or to develop income from self-employment.  The Forsa program design relies on the premise that for the eligible population of poor households with weak labor force attachment, a key determinant of program success involves changing aspirations and attitudes towards work.   Eligible households for the new Forsa program are invited to a behavioral change session designed to inform them about the new program and motivate them to enroll.  This study seeks to examine the short-term impacts this behavioral nudge on aspirations and attitudes towards work.  The analysis is based on a simple randomization of households to two different groups, one that attends the 2–4-hour behavioral change session before data collection and the other that attends the session after data collection.  In addition to simple comparisons of self-reported aspirations and attitudes, we will perform heterogeneity analyses to understand potential mechanisms.  The study is embedded within the baseline data collection activities for a larger evaluation of the Forsa intervention  "Expanding Opportunity: Testing asset grants and jobs programs for Egypt’s poor."
