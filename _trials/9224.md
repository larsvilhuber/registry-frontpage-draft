abstract: "Private firms in developing countries face many hiring frictions. Increasingly, firms use employment agencies to find professional workers. How may employment agencies improve firmsâ€™ hiring outcomes? We focus on a new type of employment agencies in Ethiopia who match skilled labor to professional jobs. We sample 800 private firms with a job vacancy, and randomly match an employment agency to half of the vacancies to provide an extra applicant. Enumerators will conduct the first follow-up survey one month after to collect details of applicants and employers' perceptions of workers' productivity and outside options. Enumerators will conduct the second follow-up five months after to collect match quality outcomes for the hired workers.
