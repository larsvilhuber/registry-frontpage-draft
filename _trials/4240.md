abstract: "We present the motivation, design and analysis plan for the SEWA Wage Insurance Experiment (SWIE).  The SWIE is a randomized controlled trial examining the demand for and impacts of providing so-called "hospi-cash'' insurance that provides a per-diem indemnity payment while a beneficiary is hospitalized.  We brand this a wage insurance product because SEWA intends it to cover lost wages due to hospitalization, even though it can cover other costs and consequences of hospitalization as money is fungible.  The SWIE offers roughly 200 villages access to two hospi-cash policies.  The SWIE randomizes the prices to which villages are offered access to these two plans.  The SWIE has two methodological innovations.  First, it identifies sharp non-parametric bounds on demand using the approach in Tebaldi et al. (2019).  Second, we develop a new approach to experimental design in order to choose prices so as to minimize the width of these non-parametric bounds.  The SWIE also contributes to our understanding of the value of indemnity health insurance policies.  The SWIE examines impacts of prices on hospi-cash insurance and health care insurance uptake and the impact of prices and uptake of hospi-cash on hospi-cash insurance claims and health care utilization.  The evidence on uptake also estimates demand for indemnity insurance.  The SWIE also estimates adverse selection into this wage insurance.  Finally, the experiment also examine whether the hospi-cash insurance product improves risk-sharing within treatment villages."
