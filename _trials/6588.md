abstract: "In this intervention, we connect treated job-seekers to suitable vacancies in the manufacturing sector. We work in partnership with the International Rescue Committee (IRC).  Over the course of nine months (from February 2019 until November 2019), we simultaneously collected information about job-seekers and job openings. We reached job-seekers through a combination of passive and active methods (job-seekers could apply to be part of the program at the IRC offices, and we also actively reached out to job-seekers through home visits and by using lists produced by community organisations), aiming to include a similar number of Syrian refugees and Jordanian job-seekers.  The programme was open to individuals who were aged between 18 and 45 years (inclusive), and who were willing to take up low-skilled wage work in the immediate future."
