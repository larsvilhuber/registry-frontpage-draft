abstract: "How can we characterize the outcomes of unstructured bargaining? We study unstructured bargaining in a lab experiment where one party has significantly more bargaining power. Players bargain in groups of three via chat. We test how well standard concepts from cooperative game theory can characterize outcomes, focusing on the Shapley value and the nucleolus. "
