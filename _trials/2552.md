abstract: "This study is a randomized control trial to evaluate the impact of the project titled “Project for Support to Food Production and Build Resilience in the departments of Alibori, Borgou, and Collines (PAPVIRE-ABC)” implemented by Benin Ministry of Agriculture. 
Benin used to be a non-critical food security country till early 2000. However, due to severe climatic hazards which caused drought and floods with serious consequences since 2010, some parts of the country reached an alarming level of food and nutrition insecurity. As a result, household income was affected because of loss of production, precarious living conditions have increased, rural exodus and social conflicts over the use of land and transhumance corridors have been exacerbated.
In designing PAPVIRE, the overall goal is to improve food and nutrition security, as well as to help reduce poverty in the project impact area. As for the impact evaluation study, its main objective is to evaluate the impact of the innovative model of agricultural advisory as implemented by PAPVIRE, on productivity  and food security of households in Benin. 
From a policy perspective, the study seeks to address evidence gap regarding food security, poverty reduction, and resilience. As far as our knowledge is concerned, there is very few studies that focused on agricultural extension as a package in Benin as projects using this approach are rare . In that respect, findings from this research will assist policymakers reshape rural development policy, projects and programs to improve living conditions of the most vulnerable segments of the population.
