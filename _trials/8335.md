abstract: "Natural resource systems like the artisanal fisheries at Lake Victoria in Tanzania are a prototypical example for the "tragedy of the commons": Each fisherman has an incentive to harvest more for his own short-term economic gain but the cost of doing so is borne by all. 
To overcome such social dilemma and to ensure collectively sustainable fishing practices, rules and regulations are necessary. Among the measures to foster sustainable resource use at the Tanzanian lakeside is a governmental regulation that limits the mesh size of seine nets to 8mm. However, compliance with this regulation is weak and illegal nets (with mesh sizes smaller than 8mm) are common. Our first research objective is to estimate the baseline willingness to pay for legal fishing nets. To this end, we extend a multiple price list approach to fit a setup that allows the purchase of multiple units. Our second research objective is to test whether a "norm-nudge" can increase fishermen's willingness to pay for legal seine nets."
