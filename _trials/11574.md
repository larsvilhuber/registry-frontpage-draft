abstract: "Entrepreneurs are important drivers of development. Nevertheless, existing entrepreneur training programs had small and heterogeneous impacts. This project explores whether a mostly psychological intervention can make early-stage entrepreneurs believe in their abilities to improve in any skill and be able to actually do so, thereby bridging the gap between the needs of developing country entrepreneurs and the often Silicon Valley-influenced expectations of accelerators. This project runs an online lab experiment with participants who have a connection to entrepreneurship recruited from Amazon MTurk's India-based workers and Prolific's USA-based workers. The study tests whether a mostly psychological intervention is a viable way to encourage participants to believe in their abilities to improve their financial literacy (or any other skill) and to lead to actual improvements."
