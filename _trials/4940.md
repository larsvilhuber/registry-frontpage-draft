abstract: "Enhancing female labor force participation is considered key to economic growth, poverty alleviation, and women’s empowerment. Despite its importance both at the national and household/individual levels, the female labor force participation rate remains low in South Asian countries.  It has been a great interest for researchers and policy makers how to enhance female labor force participation in these countries. We investigate whether providing unmarried young women and their parents with information about working conditions through the role model working women encourages unmarried young women’s labor force participation in rural Bangladesh, and if so, how. For this objective, we conduct the randomized controlled trial. "
