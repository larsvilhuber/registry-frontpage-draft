abstract: "This work involves the online implementation of a survey experiment with random assignment. Each participant is presented with five different vignettes in which firms or consumers generate negative externalities and the government intervenes to address the external costs. Participants are asked to rate the fairness of the externality, the government intervention, and the situation that exists once the intervention is in place. The vignettes, inspired by the work of Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler (1986) are designed to test individualsâ€™ responses to the framing and characteristics of the negative externality and the government response to the externality.
