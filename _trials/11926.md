abstract: "Participation of Black patients in clinical trials remains low relative to population and disease-burden benchmarks. We investigate whether increased racial diversity of trial principal investigators could increase enrollment of Black patients. To do so, we conducted a survey experiment in which respondents were shown a photo of a current NIH investigator in which race (Black/White) was cross-randomized as was gender (male/female) to provide a relevant benchmark. Black respondents reported 10.5 percent higher interest in participating in a clinical study led by a race concordant investigator. Gender concordance had no effect. Multivariate regression analyses point to perceived trustworthiness as the most important factor in explaining the pattern of results. Our findings suggest that increasing the racial diversity of clinical trial investigators is a potentially effective method for encouraging enrollment of Black participants in medical research.
