abstract: "We unpack sources of "image utility", which is a source of social preferences, and device a scheme that mitigate sufferings from income comparisons. More specifically, in our first stage of the experiment, we measure how much people care about their image (i) when  they feel proud/ashamed (hedonic image), and (ii) when they expect others to treat them better/worse when the others interact with them (instrumental image). In doing so, we conduct hypothetical discrete choice experiments a la Shigeoka and Yamada (2019, JEBO) in five countries (US, UK, Singapore, Australia, and South Africa). With these experiments we can understand the nature of social preferences more in depth, which would enable us to device a better scheme to mitigate sufferings from income comparisons than the one used in Shigeoka and Yamada (2019, JEBO). Then, we conduct a RCT study to test if newly devised scheme indeed have an expected impact.  "
