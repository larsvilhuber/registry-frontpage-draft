abstract: "This document describes a pre-analysis plan (PAP) for a lab-in field experiment on promoting biofortified maize. The primary objective of the experiment is to identify effective message-framing techniques to bring about behavior change with regard to production of biofortified maize in Ethiopia. A between-subject design will be implemented to mainly ascertain effects of differently framed health messages on farmersâ€™ willingness to pay. In addition to ascertaining the direct effects of differently framed health messages the study will also investigate potential heterogeneous effects the treatment. "
