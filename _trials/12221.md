abstract: "Third-party fraud generates significant individual and social welfare loss, especially in low-income countries such as Uganda. However, most fraud prevention communications are packaged as public service announcements and fail to provide consumers with the skills to recognize and respond to fraud. This study seeks to create fraud prevention capabilities via IVR-based narrative games. We will randomize 20,000 users into control and treatment groups. The treatment participants will be encouraged to play an interactive narrative game in which they must navigate how avoid fraud (but still discern legitimate actors), unlocking levels as they go. A second-level randomization of the treatment group will evaluate the importance of IVR reinforcement messages for sustaining or enhancing impact. Fraud victimization and a fraud prevention capability index will be measured one-month and nine months after the intervention, while administrative data will be collected to compare use of fraud reporting and SIM verification tools."
