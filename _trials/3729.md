abstract: "Automated writing evaluation (AWE) systems use artificial intelligence to score and comment essays. We designed an experiment with two treatment arms in Brazil to study the effects of AWE-based pedagogy programs on writing skills. In both treatments, teachers were stimulated to use an AWE system that provides students with instantaneous performance signals on their essays. In both cases, students receive a final grade and formative feedback. However, in one of them this grade is set by human graders, who supervise the feedback and deliver a delayed but arguably richer assessment. The mechanisms we describe range from changes in the amount of training to the reallocation of teachers' time to different tasks. The results help address the question of whether and how these technologies can be used to improve writing skills in a post-primary education developing country context. More generally, we provide information on the potentials and limitations of artificial intelligence."
