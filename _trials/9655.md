abstract: "This study seeks to better understand the relationship between subjective beliefs and commitment contract take-up. Specifically, we will run a two-session modification of the survey-based experiment from Augenblick and Rabin (2019). We ask participants to predict the number of tasks they will do in the current session and in the next session for various wages, and also elicit the number of tasks they want themselves to do in the next session. We offer participants commitment contracts to perform a target number of Greek transcription tasks. Leveraging natural uncertainty, we collect participantsâ€™ subjective beliefs about the full distribution of how many tasks they think they will do in the future and collect their beliefs about the probability of reaching the target number of tasks both without and with the commitment contract. 

We experimentally manipulate beliefs in two ways. First, we manipulate aspects of commitment contract. In particular, we record beliefs and commitment take-up under different task target numbers, different benefits of doing the task, and different penalties of missing the task target. Second, we inject uncertainty about when participants will perform future tasks, allowing us to manipulate beliefs without manipulating the contract itself.
