abstract: "We will study the LENA Start Program (LSP) implemented by the Alief Independent School District in Houston, Texas. We aim to investigate the determinants of high-quality parent-child interactions. In particular, we will evaluate if LSP raises the quality of the language environment by changing maternal expectations about the importance of verbal interactions for language development. 

Our study is significant for public policy because the LSP is a highly-scalable parent-directed language intervention that school districts, hospitals, and public libraries offer to families across the USA. In 2021, approximately 2,000 families enrolled in this ten-week, center- and group-based program. 

Every LSP section has three parts: education (we teach parents about early brain and language development), coaching (parents watch videos of other parents’ verbal interactions with children), and objective feedback (parents receive a report of the quality of the language environment). The program also encourages parents to read books to children. Finally, once every three months, the parents complete the LENA Development Snapshot (a parent-report assessment of a child’s language development). 

During this study, Alief ISD will enroll N = 360 families, which we will randomly assign to LSP or control. We will collect data at baseline and endline. In the baseline, we will measure the language and the home environments, parental beliefs, and the child’s language development. In the endline, approximately 10 weeks later, we will assess the language and the home environments, and parental beliefs. 

We will report two treatment-effect parameters. First, we will estimate the Intent-To-Treat. We expect that some treatment families will not enroll in the program. Note that we will not allow control parents to enroll in the program. Therefore, we will also use enrollment and assignment to implement a two-stage least squares procedure to estimate the effect of the treatment on the treated parameter.
