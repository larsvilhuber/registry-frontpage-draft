abstract: "We employ an online randomized lab experiment to estimate the impact of a company's bankruptcy status on consumer demand for that company's products and services. We identify each participant's hypothetical willingness to pay for a product of a firm. We measure how that willingness to pay changes when we exogenously vary information about the firm's bankruptcy status."
