abstract: "Cash transfer programs have become extremely popular in the developing world. This registration references a study which analyzed the impact of a productive cash transfer program on early childhood cognitive development, allocation of child labor within the household, and households' risk management (to weather and climate shocks) through income diversification.  Additionally, researchers identified female leaders in each community and randomized if the leaders also received the treatment. In this way, the study provided an opportunity to analyze the role of social interactions in productive investments.  The analysis of each outcome was done with the same sample of 106 villages in rural Nicaragua. Children in households randomly assigned to receive benefits had significantly higher levels of development nine months after the program began. The different variations of the cash transfer affect child labor of boys and girls within the household differently. Additionally, the transfer provided protection against drought shocks two years after the end of the program, and households that received a productive investment grant also had higher average consumption levels. And finally, the empirical results show that social interactions with nearby leaders positively affected human capital and productive investments as well as the future-oriented attitudes of other female beneficiaries, both during and after the intervention.
