abstract: "In this project, we use controlled laboratory experiments to investigate the aggregation of information in groups and the efficiency properties of this process. In particular, we construct a natural setting in which we will study how the size of the group, the strength of the signals, and information structure affect the degree to which information contained in the private signals is aggregated through mutual observation of others' actions.
