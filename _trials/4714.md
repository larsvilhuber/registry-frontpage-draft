abstract: "Under the proposed study, we will investigate the long-term impacts of a Payments for Ecosystem Service (PES) scheme that was implemented between 2011 and 2013 in western Uganda. The PES scheme was implemented as randomized control trial in 121 villages (
RCT ID AEARCTR-0000047). A follow-up study will be conducted with both forest owners, who were eligible for PES, and additional non-forest owners. In particular, following impacts will be investigated: a) whether PES affect the propensity to engage in pro-environmental behavior in the long-term, as well as environmental attitudes and beliefs; b) whether PES changed the sharing of forest resources and access to privately owned forests at the community level; c) whether PES affect social preferences, in particular spiteful behavior, between community members, d) whether human-wildlife conflicts increased due to the intervention and how attitudes towards chimpanzee conservation were affected and e) whether the intervention changed the influence of the take-up rate at the village level on individual PES enrollment decisions (hypothetical)."
