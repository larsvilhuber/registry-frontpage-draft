abstract: "Children have the right to know what violence and abuse are and where they can get help if they are affected. Kindergartens and schools have a responsibility to prevent bullying, violence, and abuse from happening, and to ensure that all children have a safe and supportive kindergarten and school environment. The Children's Convention states that all children have the right to protection from violence and that authorities are obligated to take all appropriate measures to protect children from violence, including measures in education. "Jeg Vet" contributes to providing children and young people with knowledge that can prevent and protect them from being exposed to or subjecting others to bullying, harassment, violence, and abuse. This project aims to assess the effect of "Jeg Vet" tool in improving children's theoretical knowledge about violence and abuse."
