abstract: "In this project, we study the integration of refugee children into Jordanian society, both from the perspective of Jordanian children, and from the perspective of the Syrian refugee children. In particular, we measure discrimination, or each child’s preference for sharing with their “in-group” vis-à-vis their “out-group” to assess how well Syrian refugee children are being integrated into Jordanian society, with the education system forming an integral part of this integration. Secondly, we investigate whether a (Syrian) refugee child whose family has spent longer in Jordan will behave differently towards Jordanian children (relative to Syrian children), in comparison to a (Syrian) refugee child whose family has arrived in Jordan more recently. This speaks to the “contact hypothesis” literature. Thirdly, we study the role of narratives that may influence a child's level of discrimination by pointing participants to the fact that Syrians are mainly refugees in Jordan. We also investigate if parents' attitudes towards refugees are correlated with the choices of their children. "
