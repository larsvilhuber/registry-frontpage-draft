abstract: "We explore how being empathetic to borrowers would help with debt collections. In partnership with a leading debt collection agency in the Philippines, we randomise a group of collectors into two groups. One control group and one empathy-treated group. We collect data on the borrowers' willingness to pay and the agents' performance."
