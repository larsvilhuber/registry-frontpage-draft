abstract: "Digital technologies contribute to the growth of new forms of work such as platform jobs and gig economy, which are often performed by workers who lack safety nets that cover traditional jobs. We will study which welfare state provisions and which facets of social security are most valued by these workers. To this aim, we will conduct stated-preference (willingness-to-pay) field experiments in eight countries with different institutional settings - Poland, Italy, Germany, Belgium, Spain, France, the Netherlands and Austria - to understand which provisions are the most valued but not available currently."
