abstract: "This project aims to test a novel set of survey and measurement experiments to improve livestock statistics in Africa. We particularly introduce three innovations to the conventional livestock data collection methods. First, we introduce a specific nudge aimed to address some of the sources of potential under-reporting in livestock assets by assigning a random subset of survey respondents to an explicit nudge that addresses potential sources of under-reporting. Second, we hire local livestock experts and arrange observational counting of livestock assets by enumerators and livestock experts. Third, we administer the livestock module to primary male and female respondents in each household. Through these interventions, we aim to make an important and unique contribution to improve the quality of livestock statistics in Africa, an issue that has received limited attention. "
