abstract: "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of an innovative educational technology (EdTech) program consisting of (a) tablets and (b) (distance) tutors on the educational outcomes (numeracy, literacy, and school enrolment) of out-of-school children in developing countries. To fulfill this purpose, we conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which one half of 890 out-of-school children in Bangladesh are randomly assigned to receive tablets containing pre-installed digital numeracy and literacy content as well as tutors who call them twice per week to go over the content. We measure longer-term (approximately 1.5 years) impacts from the intervention on childrenâ€™s educational outcomes. "
