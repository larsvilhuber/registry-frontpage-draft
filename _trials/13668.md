abstract: "How do regional predictions of the number of heat events (tropical nights) for the coming summer (June to August 2024) impact citizens’ willingness to engage in voluntary adaptation efforts, support for mitigation measures and the attribution of blame to the currently elder generation? How is this impact affected if the anthropogenic contribution in the predicted number of heat events is made transparent exa nte (´forward attribution´)?  We study these fundamental questions with a large-scale survey experiment that involves 4,200 adult members from the general population in Germany. 

There are three experimental conditions: Control, Prediction, and 'Prediction with Forward Attribution' ('Attribution' for short). All participants are informed about the health threats associated to heat events and tropic nights in particular. The Prediction and the Attribution groups receive regional (100km x 100km) predictions of the number of heat events (nights when temperature does not drop below 20°C, 75percentile from an ensemble of predictions with 30 members). The Attribution group on top of that learns the number of heat events (defined the same way as above) to be expected in a typical year (such as 1850) in a world without anthropogenic climate change. Predictions presented are conditioned on participants' postcodes.

Prior to treatment, we elicit core socio-demographic variables, post codes, attitudes to climate change, science and government as well as perceptions of the frequency of local summer heat events and holiday plans. Post treatment, we elicit emotional reactions to treatment, several core outcome variable (stated and revealed preference) on attribution of blame across generations, support for adaptation and mitigation measures. The survey concludes with further socio-demographic and attitutional questions.

In a second wave to be conducted in September 2024 we want to assess the impact that experienced weather has had on the same individuals in terms of support for adaptation and mitigation measures. "
