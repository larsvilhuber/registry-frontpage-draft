abstract: "Previous research has shown that significant information asymmetries can exist between parents and their children, and parents may have misperceptions about their child's academic performance (Akabayashi, 2005; Bursztyn and Coffman 2012; Cosconati, 2009; and Weinberg, 2001). Further, several papers show providing detailed information to parents about their child's academic performance can significantly improve parental engagement and student achievement (Bergman 2013; Kraft and Dougherty, 2013; Kraft and Rogers, 2013). This project provides information to low-income families at scale and low cost by sending parents automated text messages directly from teacher gradebooks. These messages contain attendance alerts, low-grade alerts, and missed-assignment alerts. "
