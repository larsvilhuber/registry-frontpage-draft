abstract: "This work provides evidence that individuals may prefer commitment contracts to finance purchase of lumpy investments, even when a more flexible contract is available. Micro-entrepreneurs in Malawi are offered the option to purchase solar lights on two types of payments plans- either weekly installments, or a deferred lump sum payment. I measure revealed preference for these plans at differing prices, and when access to a savings technology is provided. "
