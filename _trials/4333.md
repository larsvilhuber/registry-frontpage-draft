abstract: "All pupils in Danish public schools undergo evaluations of their readiness to embark on post-compulsory school education during grade 8 and grade 9. 

One in three pupils are evaluated by teachers to be at risk of lacking the academic, social or personal skills to be ready for post-compulsory school education. 

During the last couple of years there have been a increase focus on different forms of intensive learning camps. There is little high quality knowledge on the effects of these learning camps. This trail investigates whether a 2-week intensive summer camp for academically challenged boys in 7th and 8th grade has a positive effect on academic outcomes (test scores, 9th grade exam, absenteeism), wellbeing and post-compulsory school education.

Long run outcomes such as completetion af secondary education, wage and employment might be examined at a later stages.
