abstract: "Are AI technologies complementary to direct democratic institutions? This study provides empirical evidence on this question in the context of Swiss Federal Referendums. The starting point is BallotBot, a newly built GPT-powered chatbot that has access to full-text source material for referendum actions in Switzerland. In a survey experiment to be run at the end of May, we will randomize respondents to gain access to BallotBot (treatment) or a government-provided voter guide (active control). In the survey, respondents undertake a set of survey tasks to answer the following questions: (1) Do chatbots reduce the cost of information acquisition on referendum issues? (2) Does chatbot access increase knowledge about referendum issues? (3) Does chatbot access increase (expected) referendum turnout? These results provide an early indication of how AI technologies will shape democratic institutions in the years to come."
