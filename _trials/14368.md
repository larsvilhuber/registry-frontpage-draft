abstract: "The study involves a survey of high school students, administered at their schools during regular school hours. The questionnaire will present different scenarios involving hypothetical students applying to college, their initial college portfolio choices, and the recommendations given to them by either a human or algorithmic recommender. Half of the subjects will be randomly assigned a 'human recommender' questionnaire, while the other half will receive an 'algorithmic recommender' questionnaire. The study aims to (1) measure differences in students’ perceptions of college application recommendations when these are provided by a human counselor vs. an algorithm, and (2) identify the mechanisms that drive students’ perceptions of such recommendations."
