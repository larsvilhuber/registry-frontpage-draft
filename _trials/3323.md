abstract: "Abstract: We focus on the effect of changes in the cost of ride-hailing on individual’s day-to-day decisions about various types of transportation modes. Because cost has been a major driver in the success of Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) like Uber and Lyft, and such ride-hailing options are anticipated to become cheaper in the future, we take a different approach from previous studies by exploring possible future scenarios in which the per-mile price of ride-hailing decreases relative to today. We specifically examine the extent to which ride-hailing substitutes for the use of personal vehicles, and whether it will substitute or enable various forms of transportation. In order to determine the causal, though hypothetical, effect of a per-mile cost decrease, we implement a survey instrument designed as a randomized controlled trial. We specifically examine the effect that a decrease in the per-mile cost of ride-hailing has on people’s short-run, daily mode choices for primary commute trips. We examine these impacts across a rich set of alternative modes and mode combinations, with an emphasis on the energy efficiency implications of the transportation system."
