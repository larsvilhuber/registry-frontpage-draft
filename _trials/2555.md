abstract: "This project seeks to provide new evidence on the behavioral foundations of labor supply, job search behavior, and occupational choice. I focus on impatience. I use two lab-in-the-field experiments and high-frequency phone surveys over thre months to elicit individual time preference parameters and a range of other individual characteristics, including cognitive control, non-cognitive ability, and aspirations, from a sample of young women who start their job in a light manufacturing firm in highly dynamic urban labor market in Ethiopia. I augment this data with rich administrative data from firm personnel records and bank account transactions. I use the resulting panel dataset to structurally estimate an on-the-job search model for workers with hyperbolic preferences. I hope to use the structural estimates to study counter-factual scenarios of labor supply and firm tenure, job search behavior, and occupational trajectories in the labor market under various degrees of present bias. 

I have completed piloting the survey and intervention. No baseline data has been collected.  "
