abstract: "To accelerate financial inclusion, in 2014 the Government of Indonesia adopted a law that establishes banking services without the need for branch offices: branchless banking agents. Since its launch, the number of agents has been increasing rapidly and they continue to play an important role in expanding financial services specifically to the country’s largely unbanked population. While the rapid expansion of branchless banking agents has made it possible for millions of Indonesians to have access to financial services, the market is often characterized by imperfect information about official transaction prices, overcharging, and customer mistrust. Economic theory makes ambiguous predictions about the effect of increased competition on market transparency. On the one hand, competition incentivizes agents to become more transparent in an effort to win their clients' trust and grow their business. On the other hand, competition makes financial agents more reluctant to be transparent to preserve market power and the ability to price discriminate. Working with one of the country’s largest banks, we conduct an experiment to test whether higher expected levels of competition lead to a higher willingness to disclose the bank’s official price list (price transparency), or alternatively, whether shrouding can be sustained at different levels of competition."
