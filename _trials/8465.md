abstract: "Sustainable Development Goal 7 calls for “access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all”.  Affordability is one of the largest barriers to providing this access to the 2.6 billion people relying on solid, smoky fuels. This work evaluates the impact of a micro-savings intervention aimed at achieving higher rates of consistent use of clean fuel, in this case, liquified petroleum gas (LPG). We propose to conduct a step-wedge randomized control trial (SW-RCT) in rural Tanzania to evaluate household consumption of liquified petroleum gas before and after enrollment in a savings bank program. We will respectively address the quantitative treatment effect estimates and the qualitative observation and interview results of this SW-RCT."
