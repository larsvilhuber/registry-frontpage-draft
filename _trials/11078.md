abstract: "Learning losses resulting from school closures are among the most severe global challenges
to medium and long-term recovery from COVID-19. School closures in the first two years of
the pandemic lasted roughly twice as long in developing countries compared with advanced
economies. With the existing structural fault lines in its educational system, Nepal is
staring at this catastrophe today after keeping their schools
closed continuously for a long period of time. This challenge is more acute among
candidates taking the end-of-secondary school exams. We have developed and adapted a
set of audio lessons (podcasts) to be delivered via the Interactive Voice Response (IVR)
system. IVR is an automated phone system technology that allows incoming callers to
access information via a voice response system of pre-recorded messages without having to
speak to an attendant (tutor), as well as to utilize menu options via keypad selection. The
intervention will set up an IVR-based toll-free line to deliver English and Mathematics
lessons to students who will take the SEE in 2024, (who will be in ninth grade during
the intervention). There will be weekly lesson plans for both subjects (Mathematics and
English) that will be accessible during the intervention period. The intervention will also
address issues related to students’ educational aspirations and hope. In a separate treatment
arm, students will also receive over-the-phone support from a tutor in addition to IVR-based
intervention. In this study, we examine whether providing remote learning opportunities
through IVR improves children's learning, time spent on educational activities, hopes and
aspirations."
