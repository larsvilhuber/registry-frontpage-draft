abstract: "Hiring algorithms are designed to help companies save time and resources in recruitment. Higher efficiency, however, might come at a cost of fairness, i.e. create disparities across social groups. In this experiment, we investigate how people perceive efficiency vs. fairness trade-off in personnel selection in a STEM context. We vary the degree of the efficiency-fairness tradeoff and the benchmark accuracy of the algorithm. We use gender as a social group. "
