abstract: "We collaborate with a support team in an Asian University, which provides information technology services to the university community. The support team aims at motivating participation in a crossword game, through which users will master the use of some self-services provided by them. To rise participation rate, each participant will receive a lottery as reward. We design six lotteries and randomly divide the users into six groups. The lottery incentive varies among groups. By comparing the response rate in each group, we can evaluate the longshot preference under the setting of motivating behavior."
