abstract: "Economic decisions which implicate both risk and time are frequent. While experimental evidence demonstrates robust deviations from the canonical model, Discounted Expected Utility (DEU), debate persists on what non-DEU models are appropriate for rationalizing choice. We proposes an extension of atemporal salience theory (Bordalo et al., 2012, 2013b) for the treatment of intertemporal lotteries. The elaborated model rationalizes prominent DEU deviations and delivers additional testable predictions. The modelâ€™s predictions are explored in three existing data sets, Roughly 80% of prior experimental deviations from DEU are consistent with intertemporal salience, demonstrating the value of the theory. Here we propose a novel experiment to further distinguish intertemporal salience theory from competing theories.  "
