abstract: "We evaluate the impact and effectiveness of an anti-discrimination e-learning course offered to civil servants in Ecuador. The training initiative aims to overcome discriminatory behavioral biases towards Venezuelan migrant users. The course is built using behavioral sciences principles to raise awareness of the prevalence and intensity of discriminatory practices. The overall goal is to promote the inclusion of migrants by removing behavioral and structural barriers to basic social services in different domains. Civil servants are recruited from the largest government departments or Ministries (Health, Education, Economic and Social Inclusion, Labor, and Government- Police) in collaboration with their human talent teams and the World Bank. The evaluation follows a differences-in-differences approach testing attitudes and behavior of civil servants randomly assigned to a Control and a Treated condition. The only difference between one condition and the other is the time when civil servants take the course (before or after the final survey experiment). We evaluate the attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, preferences, and perceptions of civil servants towards migrants."
