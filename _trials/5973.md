abstract: "This project studies whether and how the advice students receive in high school impacts their post-secondary education decisions. We test whether male and female students are advised toward gender-congruent fields of study and whether this contributes to the underrepresentation of women in certain fields. This is done through surveys with high school students and guidance counsellors/teachers. "
