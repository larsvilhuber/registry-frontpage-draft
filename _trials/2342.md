abstract: "Apologies are a key customer service tool for managing customer relationships. We run a field experiment with a retail technology company where customers who have a bad experience are offered an email apology and monetary compensation. We vary the wording of the apology and the size of compensation in order to test predictions of the apology model from Ho (2012). In particular, we are looking for the impact of an apology on the shape of future demand. Specifically, we want to know how apologies affect customer response to future price increases and decreases and to future bad experiences."
