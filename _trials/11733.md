abstract: "In this paper, we implement a behavioral intervention to reduce teacher sorting (e.g., good teachers choosing the best schools). In a large-scale intervention in Ecuador, we use the online platform teachers use to select the schools they would like to apply to teach to implement a low-cost experiment. In the treatment arm, we ask teachers if they consider themselves individuals committed to social causes and want to impact the lives of those most in need positively. In the control group, instead of asking, we tell them that some teachers are committed to social causes and want to have a social impact. By making salient that teachers (in general) could have a social impact and that they in particular, care about having a social impact, we expect them to apply more frequently to disadvantaged schools. Our main outcome is the likelihood of choosing and being assigned to disadvantaged schools."
