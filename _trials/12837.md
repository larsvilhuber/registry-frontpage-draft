abstract: "The well-being of mothers is linked to quality parenting and early-childhood investments. According to research, many parents struggle to adopt new parenting habits that promote child health and development. New parents endure more stress and anxiety in the months after childbirth, making maternal mental health crucial to parental welfare. Can reliable information about early childhood nutrition, maternal well-being, and mental health affect early childhood investments and child health? Is the cognitive and psychological load of finding reliable caregiving practices reduced for parents when they have access to reliable information? This study makes progress on these research questions by establishing the effects of a caregiver assistance program that offers information on best practices for child health and nutrition and psychosocial interventions designed to enhance engagement in these practices and maternal well-being."
