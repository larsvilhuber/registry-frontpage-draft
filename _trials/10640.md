abstract: "In sub-Saharan Africa, where the population is rapidly increasing and arable land per capita is declining, enhancing agricultural productivity is critical for food security and poverty alleviation. One major challenge to crop production in the region is the very low use of chemical fertilizers. Addressing this issue, a rice cultivation technique known as P-dipping has been developed. This process involves submerging rice seedlings in a mud slurry mixed with a small amount of Triple Super Phosphate (TSP) fertilizer before transplanting them. P-dipping is particularly promising as it significantly boosts rice yields, even in tropical soils, with minimal fertilizer input, making it accessible for smallholder farmers with limited financial resources. However, the underdeveloped fertilizer market in Africa, characterized by the unavailability of small fertilizer packages, may hinder the widespread adoption of this technology. This research project aims to evaluate the effects of training on P-dipping technology and the availability of small-package fertilizers on farmers' adoption rates and rice productivity. In collaboration with a government extension agency and a private fertilizer company, we provided training on P-dipping and conducted an experiment on retailing fertilizers in small quantities. The study includes 600 randomly selected rice farmers from 25 communes in the Vakinankaratra Region."
