abstract: "This study investigates the opinion of Lebanese students on the attitudes towards corruption in a general parliamentary election. Using a vignette experiment, we explore the causal effects of i) the nature of corruption, ii) the nature of the voter’s prize, iii) factors of proximity with the respondent. Using an individual post-vignette survey, we explore how attitudes towards corruption is associated with the respondents’ socio-demographic characteristics and attitudinal opinions."
