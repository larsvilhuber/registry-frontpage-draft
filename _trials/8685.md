abstract: "Inaccurate beliefs about the benefits of preventive health products are an important explanation for low demand among the poor. Because credible information about these benefits can be difficult to obtain, financial incentives are widely used to stimulate demand. Aside from a potential price effect, financial incentives may also stimulate demand by credibly signaling the importance of the preventive health investment. Thus, we study whether financial incentives increase demand for health investments through an information channel. We implement a randomized controlled trial in Uganda to study demand for nutritional supplementation, a highly effective health investment to prevent malnourishment. We randomize learning about an incentive, without actually receiving it. We study how this information treatment changes beliefs about the impact of the product on outcomes and willingness-to-pay for the product. We also study how the size of the financial incentive affects willingness-to-pay. "
