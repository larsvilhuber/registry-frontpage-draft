abstract: "The labor market in Saudi Arabia has changed dramatically over the past twenty years, with rapid
increases in womenâ€™s employment in the private sector. We investigate the role of mentoring in helping
female high school students navigate this new economic reality. We use a random- priority invitation
design to estimate the effects of an after-school formal mentoring program for high school
students in Riyadh. The program provides training and mentoring aimed at supporting students in
completing high school and making informed post-graduation plans. The study investigates the impact
of the program on the educational and career aspirations of participants."
