abstract: "We analyze the transition from primary school to secondary school in Hungary. We conduct a large-scale light-touch information campaign to analyze the effect of transparent admission standards on primary school students’ application to the college-bound upper-secondary school track. Our treatment consists of a homepage summarizing all college-bound upper-secondary schools’ admission standards. Treated schools (N = 1,130) received access to the homepage. The control school (N = 1,130) did not receive access to the homepage. We compare students’ secondary school applications in treated and control schools involving data about approximately 80,000 students to evaluate the impact of the treatment. The administrative outcome data will be available in December 2023. "
