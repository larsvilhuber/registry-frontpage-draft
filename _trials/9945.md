abstract: "Agricultural production is inherently risky and subject to weather shocks that threaten livelihoods for small-scale farmers worldwide. Short-range weather forecasts can help farmers plan immediate agricultural activities and take preventative measures that lower the likelihood of losses due to unforeseen weather. Advisory services coupled with weather forecasts can speed up learning about how forecasted weather patterns can affect crop production. We propose to test an optimal design strategy to detect treatment and spillover effects in a large population of potential program participants. We do so by developing a research design that accounts for both spillovers and adaptive assignments. We propose to assign clusters to have variation in treatment intensity of the share of users per cluster assigned to any treatment. This will generate exogenous variation in the share of farmers in a community that receive the information. After the first round of assignments, we propose to use information on uptake and engagement to reassign users in an adaptive experiment to maximize benefits to users."
