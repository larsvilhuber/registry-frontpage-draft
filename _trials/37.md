abstract: "The primary goals of this study are: (1) to measure the effect of access to finance on willingness to pay (WTP) for sanitary latrines among residents of rural Cambodia; (2) to determine whether this effect is particularly important for the poor. The design is a cluster-randomized trial: from a sample of 30 representative villages (1,383 households, stratified by IDPoor status) of Kampong Thom province, 15 villages were assigned to a financing arm, while 15 villages were controls. Residents in both treatments were offered an opportunity to purchase a low-cost, sanitary latrine. Residents of financing villages were offered a 12-month loan, while residents of control villages were required to pay cash on delivery. The sale was conducted using the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak mechanism, allowing direct observation of WTP."
