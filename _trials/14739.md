abstract: "This randomized field experiment investigates the impact of providing information about high-quality schools with open seats ("hidden gems") on families' application and enrollment decisions, school segregation, and student outcomes. The study targets applicants to New York City (NYC) middle schools for enrollment in September 2025. The intervention consists of an information email, with applicants randomly assigned to one of three groups: a treatment group receiving an email highlighting hidden gem schools, a control group receiving an email listing nearby schools, and a second control group receiving an email with no school listed.
