abstract: "We run a follow-up study for the registered field experiment "The Welfare Effects of Information Nudges - Evidence from a Natural Field Experiment" (RCT ID: AEARCTR-0002814). In a brief 3-question survey we test how our different informational treatments have affected consumer beliefs and whether the change in beliefs is associated with a change in purchasing behavior. "
