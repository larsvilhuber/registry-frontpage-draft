abstract: "In order for policymakers to make evidence-based decisions, three things must happen. First, there must be evidence on which they can base their decisions. Second, they must accurately update their beliefs based on that evidence. Finally, they must have the incentive to make their decisions according to what the evidence shows. Most research focuses on generating new evidence or on the last question. We focus on the second step. It is well-known that there are a number of behavioural reasons why people may not accurately update their beliefs. We posit that some of them may be more relevant to policymakers, either because policymakers tend to have slightly different biases than other populations or because people are particularly susceptible to some biases when presented with the kind of information that policymakers typically receive. We design an experiment to explore whether updating biases exist and whether the type of information provided may be able to reduce the impact of these biases if they do exist. We also consider other factors that may affect how policymakers update in response to study results."
