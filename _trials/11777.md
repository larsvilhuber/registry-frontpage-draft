abstract: "The trial consists on an online survey in which Spanish respondents from a representative sample are asked questions about their perception of wealth inequality in Spain. Then, some of them are randomly provided with some factual information about the current estimated values of wealth inequality in Spain. After that, both control and treated group respond to questions about their preferences for wealth taxation and about different possible schemes for such wealth taxation.

One objective of the study is to measure the possible bias or discrepancy in people's perception of wealth inequality; then, a second question we are interested in is whether people who are informed (treated group) about the current actual levels of wealth inequality correct that bias; finally, the main goal of the study will be to measure how that perception correction affects preferences for wealth taxation in general and/or for different types of wealth taxation schemes.

This trial is a sibling trial of one previously submitted and approved by AEA RCT Registry for the United Kindgom (https://doi.org/10.1257/rct.10698-1.0), in which data collection is already completed. 

Results of both trials will be analysed independently and results for both trials compared and put in the context of their respective country profiles, aiming to provide an overview of the commonalities and differences found between the two countries' population. "
