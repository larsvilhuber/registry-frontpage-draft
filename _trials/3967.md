abstract: "Physical inactivity is one of the four major risk factors for non-communicable diseases (WHO 2016). Decisions about engaging in physical activity involve making trade-offs between immediate costs and future benefits suggesting that time preference (how present or future oriented an individual is) and present bias (the enhanced significance an individual attaches to immediate outcomes) may play a part in how these decisions are made. Despite demonstrated correlational associations between physical activity and time preference and present bias, to date, time preference and present bias have not been taken into account when designing interventions to increase physical activity.  Within economics the quasi-hyperbolic model (Laibson 1997)  is currently used to model such intertemporal decision making. From examining the quasi-hyperbolic model it can be seen that the individual’s decision to engage in physical activity depends on the temporally proximal costs and the temporally distant benefits of that activity, how much they discount the temporally distant benefits and how present biased they are when the time to be active becomes immediate. This suggests that an effective intervention should aim to increase the salience of future benefits and counteract present bias. Increasing the salience of temporally distant benefits might be achieved by getting the individual to consider the future consequences of their actions and connect to their future-self. Present bias is often assumed to involve temptation and self-control. Commitment contracts (paying a forfeit for failing to follow through with plans) are often regarded as a method of overcoming temptation and therefore counteracting present bias. This leads to the conclusion that an effective intervention could aim to (a) increase the salience of temporally distant benefits of activity by considering future consequences of current inactivity and connecting to one’s future-self and (b) counteract the temptation component of present bias by applying commitment. This study seeks to develop, and then test the effectiveness of one such intervention which has the potential to be inexpensive and easy to administer and could therefore provide a valuable addition to measures being used to counteract the physical inactivity crisis."
