abstract: "The high importance of career-oriented motivations within the group of young volunteers and recent evidence that volunteering references can improve employment opportunities, suggests that job references for volunteers can motivate young adults to engage in volunteering activities. However, the question of whether job references can also have a motivational effect on the performance and continuation of volunteering remains unanswered. We assume that performance-based job references can help charitable organizations and volunteers to achieve desired volunteer behaviour better than simple job reference without individual performance indication.

In a field experiment in which young volunteers sign up to support elderly citizens as mentor over a longer period of time in using smartphones computers or tablets, we address this research gap and investigate whether and to which extent performance based job references with different underlying performance assessment mechanisms (bonus, repeated betting) can motivate existing volunteers to enlarge their volunteering activities and engage regularly with high intensity for their elderly mentees.
