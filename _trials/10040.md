abstract: "This project aims to study the effect of sending a postcard to eligible voters reminding them that it is possible to vote. The postcard has information on six foreign languages (other than Swedish) and a link to a website run by Uppsala municipality containing more information on how to vote. The postcard is sent out after early voting has opened, one to two weeks before the election day (election day is 11th of September) and is randomly sent to eligible voters in around one third of the election precincts in Uppsala municipality."
