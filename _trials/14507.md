abstract: "After over a century of decreasing working hours, weekly working hours stagnated for full-time and part-time employees in Germany in the 1990s and 2000s. We introduce social comparisons into the explanation of this trend and explore how rising wage inequality and social comparisons (in income and leisure time) affect working hours decisions. 

We conduct a survey experiment employing a between-subjects design with a representative sample of full- and part-time employees in Germany. Participants are randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups or the control group. The first treatment group is asked to think about the advantages of having more money than others. The second treatment group is asked to think about the advantages of having more leisure time than others. The third treatment group is informed about increasing wage inequality in Germany. The control group receives no additional information or question. Next, we ask all participants to indicate how many hours per week they would like to work if their earnings were to change accordingly.

Our experimental design allows us to identify the causal effects of the primes (income advantages, leisure advantages and wage inequality) on desired working hours and to investigate heterogenous effects between socio-demographic groups and by social comparison orientation and attitudes."
