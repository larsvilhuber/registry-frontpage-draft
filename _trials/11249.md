abstract: "I conduct an online survey experiment to investigate the relationship between misperceptions about social benefit program criteria, their correction, and take-up. The study focusses on the German federal financial student aid (BAföG) and elicits students’ misperceptions about the program criteria through hypothetical scenarios. Half of the participants receive bundled information designed to resolve possible misperceptions at the end of the survey. In a follow-up survey six months later, students are asked about their application status for financial aid to determine the impact of the correction of misperceptions on take-up, and misperceptions will be elicited again. The results help us to understand how misperceptions about social benefit programs relate to non-take-up, how correcting potential misperceptions influences application rates, and which reasons for non-application are especially prone to be tackled by information."
