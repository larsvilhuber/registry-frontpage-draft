abstract: "Empirical studies in developing countries have shown that improving teaching and learning practices by tailoring them to the needs of disadvantaged and struggling students may result in significant improvements of their educational results. This research project aims to evaluate the individual and combined effectiveness of two interventions: teachersâ€™ professional development and tutoring. This evaluation will be conducted in public schools in the city of Cali, Colombia"
