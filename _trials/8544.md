abstract: "The correct disposal of not-needed medication is important as incorrect disposal could cause harm to people, animals or the environment. So far, only little is known on how to effectively get pharmacy customers to dispose not-needed medication at pharmacies free of charge. In a field experiment, we examine how different a simple reminder and a hand-written reminder  affect the willingness of customers to return their not-need medication for proper disposal. We will therefore examine two different interventions to remind pharmacy customers of the possibility to dispose not-needed medication at pharmacies."
