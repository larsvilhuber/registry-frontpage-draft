abstract: "We analyze the effects of workplace flexibility on job application decisions and wages. We do this using experimental manipulation of job ads on a large Chinese online job board, measuring the job application decisions and salaries sought among real job seekers.  This plan was constructed up after we conducted a pilot study (for one occupation, during the period May-June 2017, on the same job board), but before conducting the formal experiment. "
