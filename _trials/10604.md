abstract: "Addressing the root causes of irregular migration has become a key policy priority in Europe. The EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF) was launched in 2015 with a budget of 5 billion euros to support projects aiming at deterring irregular migration flows from 26 origin countries. One of these projects is implemented by the Egyptian Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency (MSMEDA) and targets unemployed youth in areas with the highest outflows of irregular migrants. We implement two randomized evaluations to assess whether (i) cash-for-work opportunities, and (ii) training and employment support have the intended effects on the direct beneficiaries and their relatives (household decision-maker, other household members, children, and friends). We assess impacts on peopleâ€™s preferences and attitudes towards migration, irregular migration, as well as changes in their situation, aspirations, and expectations. "
