abstract: "The project will evaluate the Crescer Aprendendo program created and developed by the United Way NGO. It is an early-childhood intervention that teaches parents and teachers important tools to foment children's cognitive and socio-emotional skills. We plan to conduct a pilot randomized control trial to investigate whether the program is capable of changing teachers' and parents' beliefs toward the relevance of the quality the parents spend with their children during early childhood.. Moreover, we plan to analyze whether the program changes parents' time invested in activities to develop kids' abilities. The evaluation will focus four to five year-old children. We developed specific questionnaires to elicit the beliefs and to gather data on parents' time use. The evaluation will be conducted in 20 preschools in Sobral, a municipality in Cear√° State in Brazil. We plan to conduct baseline and end line field works at the beginning and the end of 2023 school year, respectively. Ten schools will be randomly selected to implement the program for seven months in 2023. We plan to randomly select two classes in each school and interview the teachers and three parents of children in each class. In the end, we will have a sample of 40 teachers and  120 parents.  "
