abstract: "We study whether fairness preferences are different for intra- and inter-generational settings.  In our survey, respondents will be asked to decide whether to redistribute income between a pair of workers who will be allocated unequal earnings in a hypothetical scenario.  The respondents will be randomly assigned to one of three treatments (the 1950s treatment, 1970s treatment, and 1990streatment),  where the treatments only differ with respect to the generation of one of the two workers who do not receive pre-redistribution earnings."
