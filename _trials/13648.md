abstract: "Rural communities in Egypt continue to suffer from rising diesel prices, increasing water scarcity, water management challenges and climate change, which ultimately contribute to deteriorating food security, especially after the Russia- Ukraine crisis. This project provides access to solar-powered irrigation systems (SPIS) to farmers in rural Egypt to improve access to affordable renewable energy and hence facilitate sustainable production systems and improved irrigation efficiency. Such an intervention can improve smallholders’ production potential while addressing water scarcity and related climate change-induced challenges. Using a cluster randomized control trial, we aim to estimate the impact of access to SPIS on cost of production and farm income as well as ultimate food and nutrition security."
