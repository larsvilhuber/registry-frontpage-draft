abstract: "Diarrheal disease is the second-leading cause of childhood mortality. In countries that cannot afford to provide piped water to dispersed, rural households, increasing access to safe drinking water remains a challenge. A recent paper in Science (Dupas et al., 2016) suggests that targeting coupons for water-treatment solution to mothers provides a particularly cost effective way to deliver the solution to households which need and will use the product but cannot afford it. In this study, we run a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the impact of the coupon system over time, test whether embedding the coupon system within a Community Health Work (CHW) program can enhance its impact over time, and compare the coupon system to a free delivery system implemented through trained CHW. We are partnering with Partners in Health which is running a CHW program in Neno district in Malawi."
