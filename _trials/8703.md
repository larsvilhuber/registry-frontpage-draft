abstract: "How do long and potentially imperfectly competitive supply chains affect the incentives that producers face for quality provision in developing countries? We explore this question in the context of coffee in Uganda. International coffee markets often offer large returns to quality management; however, producers in developing countries consistently fall short of these quality standards. We study how the market structure of Ugandaâ€™s coffee supply chain affects the transmission of quality incentives up to producers. We measure the quality premium along the supply chain, from downstream exporters to intermediaries to upstream producers. We explore the role of two mechanisms that may diminish the quality premium upstream: one is markdowns resulting from differential market power by quality, and the second is productive substitutability, meaning the ability of downstream agents to make quality investments that substitute for those upstream.  To differentiate between these two mechanisms and quantify their role in contributing to the diminishing quality gradient, we conduct experiments that offer randomized coffee production contracts throughout the supply chain (to both traders and farmers). These contracts induce quality-specific demand shocks that allow us to separately identify costs from markdowns, as well as understand how agents along the supply chain would respond to varying quality premia on investment in quality. We use the estimated model to examine the efficiency implications and distributional consequences of barriers to entry and productive substitutability, as well as how they interact to affect quality production and surplus distribution along the chain. Finally, we use the model to investigate counterfactual policies to induce quality upgrading."
