abstract: "At Vassarâ€™s campus, as much as half of our recycling bags are discarded due to contamination (e.g. half empty soda bottles, or wrappers contaminated by food waste). Our office of sustainability has worked on an on-going campaign to better educate Vassar students on how to recycle, but signs and orientation events seem to have limited effectiveness. Can we do better with an App. We developed a game (runs in a browser, or on phone) that teaches players to properly recycle. Subjects are randomized into 4 treatments that changes the scoring rules of the game (gaining points vs losing points, and solo scores vs cooperative scores) and a control where they do the survey before playing the game."
