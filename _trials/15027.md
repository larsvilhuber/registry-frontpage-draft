abstract: "Can social registries identify potential beneficiaries for social protection interventions at scaleâ€“in countries with low administrative capacities? The objective of this research is to answer this question in the context of Mauritania, which is currently updating its national social registry. Specifically, will explore targeting options offered by the new innovative process implemented by the social registry for improving targeting efficiency and legitimacy. While the identification of beneficiaries previously was based on community-based targeting (CBT), it has now moved largely to a system based on scoring, combined with community adjustments. In addition, the number of beneficiaries per village (quota) is now determined by the actual score of households, while it was previously based on imprecise poverty estimates at the commune level. We are implementing a 2 x 3 RCT design with the government of Mauritania to test the improvements introduced by the new process. In doing so, we are exploring questions related to the selection of beneficiaries of social programs related to thresholds, inclusive combination of methods, and legitimacy among local communities.
