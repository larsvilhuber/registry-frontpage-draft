abstract: "Online platforms face the dual challenge of promoting fairness (ensuring non-discriminatory access) and maximizing efficiency (optimizing revenue generation). In this study, we explore the impact of profile image characteristics on these goals within a micro-lending marketplace. Using computer vision algorithms and observational data, we previously found that borrowers' choices in profile creation can influence both fairness and efficiency. To further investigate these findings, we are conducting a web-based randomized survey experiment. This experiment introduces profile images generated with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which vary systematically by specific visual featuresâ€”such as age, hair, and the presence of glasses. In addition to testing the effect of these features on lender demand, the experiment includes incentives to encourage realistic engagement with lending decisions."
