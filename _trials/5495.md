abstract: "In this study, we implement a field experiment to test the effects of a mobile app that rewards sustainable mobility choices of citizens in Vienna. The app automatically tracks transport choices and rewards the choice not to take a car with free entry tickets to local cultural institutions. The app visualizes the modal split of each participant and gives feedback on general CO2 emission reduction.
The modal split of Vienna citizens has overall improved over time, yet as of 2018 the three categories forming sustainable transport methods (Walking, Cycling, Public Transport) make up 71% (Wiener Linien, 2019). Through STEP 2025 the City targets several areas of improvement, such as efficient resource usage and availability of reliable mobility modes without a necessity to own a personal means of transport.
The choice of a transport mode has many variables including comfort, availability, cost, speed and perception. By combining sustainable mobility choices with cultural offers as incentives we intend to combine the willingness of fields outside of mobility to contribute with incentives towards a more sustainable city. Daily, citizens make several decisions on their choice of transport mode. This intervention aims to introduce new variables into this choice, by visualizing and emphasizing a collective goal through individual actions. Instead of subsidizing transport choices directly and monetarily, we test the interaction of non-related incentives (cultural offers) and visualization of choices (CO2 emission reduction) with sustainable mobility."
