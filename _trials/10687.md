abstract: "We conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the effect of providing attorneys to tenants facing eviction. We partner with a local nonprofit, Neighborhood Preservation, Inc., in Memphis, Tennessee. NPI has received independent grants to provide 200â€“600 lawyers to represent tenants with eviction filings in Shelby County General Sessions Court. We assist NPI with randomizing the provision of lawyers. We study the impact of lawyers on three groups of outcomes: (1) formal eviction outcomes, including judgments, writs, nonsuits, time in court, and money owed to the landlord; (2) informal eviction outcomes collected via an endline survey, including moves, and informal bargaining; (3) financial outcomes collected via the endline survey and merged credit reports. We also study a fourth group of outcomes: (4) other outcomes collected in baseline surveys (e.g. beliefs, willingness to pay), though we do not study the treatment effects of lawyers on these outcomes since they are collected prior to treatment. 

Disclaimer: The trial is registered in a staggered fashion. In v1.0, we registered outcomes in Group 1 and the primary treatment. We also gave our best prediction about registration of the secondary treatment and outcomes in Groups 2-3. In v1.1, we registered outcomes in Group 2, prior to launching the endline surveys. In v1.2, we register outcomes in Group 4, prior to launching the baseline surveys. In v1.3, we make a few light changes: (a) updating few aspects of the registration to Group 4 based on feedback (within one month of launching the baseline survey, N < 30 collected), (b) adding some secondary heterogeneity, and (c) adding plans to test for attrition. 

In all registrations, we provide information based on our present understanding. The partner is sponsoring the provision of attorneys and we cannot delay the treatments while we get more information or pilot. 

We emphasize that the outcomes in Group 2 and Group 4 are fully preregistered, except where minor revisions are indicated. The respective surveys had not been launched at the time of their initial registration. We were able to observe some preliminary results from Group 1 with a pilot sample that we intend to pool with the main estimates. That is why we registered these outcomes as soon as we could in v1.0. 

Timeline: 
v1.0 - initial registration, after treatment assignment for some participants and after some administrative outcomes collected. Before any surveys collected and credit reports purchased. 
v1.1 - updated registration for outcomes collected in endline survey. Fully preregistered before endline surveys launched.
v1.2 - updated registration for outcomes collected in baseline survey. Fully preregistered before baseline survey launched. We also clarify that the control group, when they receive a notice that they were not selected for representation, also receives some information. This has been a part of the study since before registration in 1.0, and nothing has changed about the treatment. But we wanted to make it clearer in the registry. 
v1.3 - updated registration to: include additional heterogeneity in the baseline survey; change plans for how we will use reference good; propose plans to study attrition using several sub-randomizations; update plans for secondary treatment; and register that our measures of trust are elicited via Trust Games. 

For primary outcomes: 
Group 1 was registered after data collection began (v1.0).
Group 2 was preregistered before endline data collection began (preliminary in v1.0, registered v1.1).
Group 3 remains preliminary (through v1.2). 
Group 4 was preregistered before baseline survey data collection began (preliminary through v1.1, registered in v1.2, updates in v1.3).

Note: We pre-register secondary survey outcomes before data is collected. Some secondary survey outcomes are in Group 3 and are indicated as such in the secondary outcomes section. "
