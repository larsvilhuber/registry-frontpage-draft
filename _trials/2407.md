abstract: "This project experimentally evaluates the effects of public per-student subsidies to local partnering entrepreneurs to establish and operate tuition-free, coeducational private primary schools in educationally underserved rural communities in Sindh province, Pakistan. Two different subsidy structures were tested, one in which the subsidy amount did not differ by the studentâ€™s gender, and the other in which the subsidy amount was higher for female students.
The latter structure was motivated by the interest of the program administrators to correct for the existing gender disparity in school enrollment in the general setting. The program increased school enrollment by 30 percentage points in treated communities, for both boys and girls. The gender-differentiated subsidy structure did not produce a greater increase in female enrollment than the gender-uniform one. The program increased test scores by 0.67 standard deviations in treated communities. Program schools proved more effective in raising test scores than government schools in the geographic vicinity, with program students scoring 0.16 standard deviations higher, despite coming from more socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds. Structural estimations of the supply and demand for schooling suggest nearly efficient choices on school inputs by the program administrators and partnering entrepreneurs.
