abstract: "Decision makers in positions of power often make unobserved choices under risk and uncertainty. In many cases, they face a trade-off between maximizing their own payoff and those of other individuals. What inferences are made in such instances about their choices when only outcomes are observable?

In a previous laboratory experiment, we investigated whether outcomes are attributed to luck or choices. Our results reveal that attribution biases exist in the evaluation of good outcomes. On average, good outcomes are attributed more to luck as compared to bad outcomes. This asymmetry in the way good and bad outcomes are attributed implies that decision makers get too little credit for their successes. Importantly, the biases detected tend to be driven by those individuals who make the selfish choice themselves when placed in the role of the decision maker.

In this follow-up study, we investigate some of the mechanisms that may be driving these biases."
