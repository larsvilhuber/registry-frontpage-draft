abstract: "We investigate whether behavioral insights can improve the effectiveness of communications to taxpayers from the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In particular, we study the effect of changing the design and wording of IRS notices in the Automated Substitute for Return (ASFR) program on the compliance of delinquent taxpayers. Our main goal is to identify the effect of low-cost “nudges” on non-filing behavior by investigating how 1) adding an additional low-cost notice in between the automated 30- and 90-day letters and 2) changing the design and wording of IRS notices affects compliance among non-filers in the ASFR program. Specifically, we plan to address the following research questions: Is an additional low-cost letter effective in nudging non-filers toward filing? What is the return-on-investment of an additional letter in terms of nudging non-filers to file? Does the effectiveness of the letters vary by the messaging? Do the effects of these letters persist into the next tax year?
