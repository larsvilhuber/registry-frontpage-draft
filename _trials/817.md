abstract: "A growing body of research suggests that innovation and quality improvements by manufacturing firms--which together we refer to as "industrial upgrading"--are key elements in the process of private enterprise development in low-income countries. It is widely recognized that industrial upgrading is not automatic: some sectors in some countries successfully move up the ladder to more technologically sophisticated, higher value-added products, and others fail to do so. 

To investigate the role of the high cost of high-quality inputs in constraining upgrading, we propose an experiment with soccer-ball producers in Sialkot, Pakistan. We will provide subsidies for an input, an artificial leather known as rexine, that is an important determinant of the quality of a soccer ball. The subsidies are offered to a random set of firms, and we will compare outcomes at the end of the experiment between treatment and control.
