abstract: "Diets in many countries in the Global South are moving towards more processed, unhealthy foods. A good example is Indonesia – the fourth most populous country in the world. While the country has traditionally grappled with undernutrition, food consumption patterns are shifting rapidly. Food expenditures on unhealthy (processed) foods are rising fast especially in urban areas. Unhealthy food consumption raises the risk of overweight, diabetes and ultimately cardiovascular diseases in later life, leading to substantial economic costs and reduced productivity in the future. 
One popular policy response to tackle the growing consumption of unhealthy food in the Global North has been the introduction of interpretive nutrition labels. The aim of this project is to explore potentially scalable interventions to improve the food choices of parents and children in Indonesia in a series of lab-in-the-field experiments. The project will test one concrete policy nudge in the form of “traffic lights” labels and further our understanding of how parents (mothers or primary caregivers) can influence children’s food choices. The research will rely on quantitative experimental methods and will be implemented by an interdisciplinary team of international and local researchers. "
