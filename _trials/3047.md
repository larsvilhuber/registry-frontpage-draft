abstract: "This project will study the changes in transactional volume of credit and debit cards when individuals increase their saving balances in a checking account. Specifically, we plan to study what are the spending categories that experience the larger decreases or increases in transactional volume, after increases in saving balances in checking accounts. We will also test whether individuals borrow more or not because they increase the balances in their checking accounts."
