abstract: "This study aims to examine constraints to entrepreneurship and different means to alleviate these constraints for female and male youth in Kenya. The large-scale randomized control trial studies the combined and isolated impacts of providing business grants, business development services (BDS) of different forms (classroom, one-on-one counselling, and digital), behavioral interventions (future-self goal setting), and peer support through moderated whatsapp groups. The study further tests the effectiveness of an Entrepreneurship Aptitude Test that scores applicants on their entrepreneurial ability prior to program launch. "
