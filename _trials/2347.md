abstract: "In this study we analyze two aspects of microcredit group lending. First, we seek to analyze credit demand for different micro loans using choice experiments and data from an existing randomized evaluation in which four different loan products were randomly offered to clients. The choice experiments will help us to better understand take-up decisions of offered loans contracts in the field experiment. Second, we seek to analyze group structures of lending groups and how peer monitoring and punishment are applied to increase repayment performance of lending groups. We use lab-in-the-field experiments to study group structures and the role of the group leader. We combine this information with repayment data from the aforementioned randomized evaluation to understand the external validity of our lab findings. "
