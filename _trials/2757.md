abstract: "We investigate how individuals choose their peers and how endogenous peer selection influences performance. In a field experiment with students of a business school, we vary whether study groups are put together randomly, or whether students can choose their group partner endogenously. With the help of pre-elicited educational performance as well as demographic data, we are able to trace how individuals choose their partner and how these choices influence their group and individual performance during the course. Besides average performance, we analyze how the selection procedure influences the distribution of performance. We measure performance on three consecutive events. The groups' performance is measured by their score on two different exercise sheets during the semester and individual performance is measured by a student's outcome on the final exam. Students only learn about their performance after the final exam. Secondary outcomes of interest are ability beliefs, satisfaction, and social preferences."
