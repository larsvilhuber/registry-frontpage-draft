abstract: "National energy supply in Pakistan is characterized by excessive demand that cannot be sufficiently supplied by its national grid. As a result, power cuts are frequent and prolonged throughout the country. Rural small-medium sized entrepreneurs are particularly susceptible to this reduction in energy access as it risks impacting their productive capacity. To address this concern, renewable energies have been introduced to SMSEs in rural areas. Demand for these technologies, however, needs to be understood further. Therefore, we evaluate an intervention which focuses on understanding how the demand and uptake of RE loans and RE technologies can be incentivized through subsidies. A randomized control trial is conducted using a lottery allocated cash prize subsidy to assess uptake behavior. Primary outcomes of interest are  uptake, with a focus on heterogeneity w.r.t. baseline characteristics of the entrepreneurs. "
