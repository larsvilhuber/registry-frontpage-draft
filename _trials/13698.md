abstract: "Gender segregation in labor markets is a prevalent issue in poor countries, leading to significant wage gaps and talent misallocation. Efforts to address this segregation by promoting female labor supply depend on the level of discrimination women face upon entering the labor market. Our study tests for gender discrimination in Uganda, characterized by severe asymmetric information problems. Partnering with a vocational training center, we conduct an experiment with employers to examine the effect of gender on hiring decisions for trainees.
Our key intuition is that, in contexts characterized by severe asymmetric information, trustworthiness is a key determinant of hiring decisions. Given the evidence that women are generally perceived as more prosocial/trustworthy, we investigate whether this perception induces a comparative advantage for women in the labor market.  We conduct two primary analyses: first, we assess gender differences in hiring outcomes; second, we examine how these gender differences evolve as the relevance of asymmetric information (moral hazard) in hiring decreases. We also examine the interplay with ability, gender preferences, and the drivers of women/men perceived differences in trustworthiness. We compare managers' beliefs about gender differences in behavior with data on actual behavior of job seekers.
