abstract: "A large body of research finds that communities of concentrated poverty - defined as having a poverty rate between 30 and 40 percent - face many serious challenges: higher crime rates coupled with poor physical and mental health outcomes, lower levels of educational attainment, and weaker labor market outcomes. These same communities have been especially hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. High-poverty counties have experienced a much higher virus mortality rate (19.3 deaths per 1,000 in counties with at least a 20-percent poverty rate, more than double the rate for counties with poverty rates below five percent), and a higher confirmed case rate in at least one state. The most disadvantaged families also appear to be the least likely to benefit from some of the supports provided through the CARES act such as the economic impact payment, and existing research suggests that these highly disadvantaged families may see the biggest improvement in material hardship from income transfers. This study will investigate the effects of a one-time, unconditional cash transfer on families who live in zip codes in the United States with poverty rates greater than or equal to 35 percent. Randomly selected recipients will be surveyed approximately six weeks after receiving the lump-sum payment and their responses to questions about material hardship, mental health, child well-being, partner relationships, and parenting practices will be compared against those of a control group. Results will inform policy debates about the efficacy of cash transfers during acute economic crises."
