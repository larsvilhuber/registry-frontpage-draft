abstract: "This study will identify the impact of information on students' decision making and demand for education. We will provide students in 600 randomly selected Ghanaian junior high schools with information about senior high school application strategies, selectivity, and exit exam performance. We will then examine changes in their beliefs, subsequent senior high school application and enrollment decisions, and educational attainment, identifying how access to information impacts student welfare. We will also evaluate the cost-effectiveness of providing information directly to parents relative to targeting only students and teachers."
