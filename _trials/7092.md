abstract: "Women in fragile contexts are more likely to experience displacement or have their education interrupted and, have less access to employment and income opportunities, as compared to men. Women also face limited mobility and physical access to markets; incomplete access to market information; and restricted access to credit and other financial services. All this makes it quite challenging to engage women in economic activities and help them overcome poverty. Public work programs (PWP) and Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) have been widely implemented as social protection instruments to fight poverty. Evidence on the effectiveness and gendered impacts of CCTs has been widely documented, whereas the evidence on the effectiveness and gendered impacts of PWP is still scarce and comes mainly from the experiences in India and Argentina, with limited evidence from fragile contexts. This evaluation will contribute to the literature by providing evidence on the gendered impacts of PWP in fragile contexts. In particular, we aim to test the hypothesis that in fragile contexts, women, and particularly the poorest women, don’t have the same capacity as men to fully leverage PWP’s benefits. Factors such as stronger care burdens, limited capacity to react to shocks, limited opportunities to invest, limited bargaining power, or partners with stronger gender norms, may be constraining the capacity of women to fully take advantage of the program. To test this hypothesis we exploit the random selection of individuals to participate in a PWP implemented in the provinces of Ituri and Nord Kivu in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). "
