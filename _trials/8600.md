abstract: "Migrant children's enrollment in social health insurance is low in China. It is unclear whether the low enrollment is due to the lack of information on the eligibility, price of the social health insurance, or administrative burden of applying for social health insurance in metropolitan cities. We plan to conduct an experiment that examines the effect of information on willingness to enroll, actual enrollment decision, the price they intend to pay, the reason they purchase/or not purchase, their stress level, and their concern about healthcare cost. More specifically, in control group we tell them that health is important for children, and health insurance can protect families from catastrophic cost. In treatment 1 group, we tell them that their children are eligible to enroll in health insurance. In treatment 2 group, we tell them the same information in treatment 1, and in addition, we compare social health insurance in the city that they reside and the social health insurance in their hometown. For treatment group, we also plan to call them or message them to remind them about enrollment. "
