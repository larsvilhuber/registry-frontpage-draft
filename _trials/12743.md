abstract: "While many companies have achieved a close to 50:50 gender split in recruiting intake, the progression along the career path for women and men is different. Multiple studies show that both women’s promotion and retention rates are lower than men’s, resulting in a widening gender gap at higher career levels. Possible explanations may be related to discriminatory issues, differences in lifestyle choices, or differences in preferences. Well-documented preferences that may partially explain observed differences in economic outcomes include gender differences in competitiveness and challenge seeking. The aim of this study is to understand if women and men who self-select into working on a challenging task differ with respect to their challenge persistence. Do women who seek a challenge in the first place behave similarly to men if the difficulty level further increases that is, a second challenge is proposed? To answer this question, we conduct an online experiment on Prolific. The focus of this study is to observe the behavior of initial challenge seekers if they are confronted with a second subsequent challenge. In line with previous research, we also assess if gender differences exist at the initial challenge seeking decision point. We extend this field of research by analyzing if gender differences continue to persist among the original challenge seekers when they are confronted with a subsequent challenge. We also analyze if challenge seeking increases for participants who did not choose the challenge in stage 2, when they are given a second opportunity to enter the same challenge in stage 3."
