abstract: "This project focuses on the intersection of propaganda and censorship in China, where state media and other accounts post propaganda content on social media and censor undesirable comments under these posts. The experimental part of this project will evaluate to what extent comment moderation affects public opinion and political attitudes. We will conduct survey experiments based on real propaganda posts and comment censorship behavior exercised by state-sponsored social media accounts.
