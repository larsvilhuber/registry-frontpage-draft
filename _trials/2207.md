abstract: "Consumers face countless opportunities to borrow and spend on impulse. We work with a leading check casher in New York City to develop and test a new product that facilitates impulse saving. The product links check cashing transactions to a basic savings account by prompting customers to make a deposit every time they cash a check. Using a field experiment, we estimate the effects of receiving prompts relative to the account without the prompts on savings behavior.
