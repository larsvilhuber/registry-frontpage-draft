abstract: "Political polarization can negatively impact governance and democracy. Enriquez et al. (2024) document through a field experiment in 500 Mexican municipalities that political polarization leads to biases in information processing that can undermine electoral accountability.
At the same time, recent academic literature documents successful interventions in reducing affective polarization (Ahler and Sood, 2018; Levendusky, 2018; Kalla and Broockman, 2023; Druckman et al., 2022). In turn, Enriquez et al. (2024) show that alerting citizens about biases in information processing due to being guided by feelings, ideology, or partisanship has the potential to restore the benefits of consuming information about incumbent government performance for electoral accountability. We plan to evaluate the cross-randomization of antipolarization treatments and a bias alert within a survey to a nationally representative panel of 6,000 respondents in Mexico. We will use survey measures of information consumption to descriptively and causally assess how political polarization affects the consumption and internalization of ideologically opposed information. Our goal is to help design scalable interventions so that more citizens process politically relevant information regardless of their ideological or partisan position. Informed political participation, which is based on the consumption and processing of information across the entire ideological spectrum, is fundamental to good governance."
