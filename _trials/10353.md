abstract: "We cooperate with a large German retail bank and combine administrative bank data with online survey data to examine the motivations and obstacles of retail investors to invest under the consideration of ESG criteria. In the course of the survey, we will randomly allocate participants to a control group, or to one of three information treatments. In the information treatments, we expose participants to true, openly available information about ESG-investments. Post-treatment questions and the administrative data, which include investment and trading records, allow us to study the effects of the information treatments on intended and actual investment choices, as well as underlying mechanisms."
