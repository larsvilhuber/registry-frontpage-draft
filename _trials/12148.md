abstract: "Governments and public health experts have used mass media campaigns to limit the spread of COVID-19 by encouraging social distancing. This paper explores the effectiveness of a health campaign via a large-scale field experiment conducted in Cook County, Illinois. In December 2020, approximately 125,000 households were sent mail from the University of Chicago Medicine encouraging social distancing during the holiday season. Within targeted geographies, we varied both the dosage of treatments as well as publicity --- whether recipients were informed that their neighbors also received the messages --- to highlight the strategic considerations underlying social distancing. We find minimal effects of the campaign on travel during the holidays and on other social distancing behavior. We consider our results in light of a similar intervention reported in Breza et al (2021) and conclude that travel was unlikely to be influenced by messages from public health experts prior to the 2020 holiday season.
