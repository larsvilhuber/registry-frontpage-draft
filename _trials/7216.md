abstract: "Despite improving trends in gender equality, gender gaps remain pronounced in modern societies, especially in the labor market. Conventional and restrictive gender norms, which stress women’s family-focused role and men’s career-focused role, further reinforce and reproduce gender inequality. With such gender ideology, employers may think of female employees as less career-minded and potentially incur higher labor costs due to the paid maternity leave. Therefore, female employees would be less favorable than their male counterparts would. Policy interventions, for instance, a rational-designed parental leave policy may help to reduce such gender discrimination in the labor market. In this study, we conduct an experiment using the correspondence testing method on the Chinese labor market. We investigate whether and to what extent gender discrimination exists  in the labor market of China. If so, whether the current paid maternity leave plays an unintended role in exacerbating this situation. Understanding these questions is crucial for policymakers to improve the current parental leave policies and reduce the gender gap in the labor market."
