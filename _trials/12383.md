abstract: "Learning losses due to COVID-19 have been substantial, especially for students coming from low socioeconomic backgrounds, further worsening existing learning deficits in many developing countries. To address these losses, the use of tutoring and computer-assisted instruction holds promise for accelerating learning recovery. However, there is limited knowledge on how education systems can effectively implement these approaches at scale. Computer adaptive learning (CAL) softwares are particularly noteworthy for their ability to cater to students' individual learning levels. However, most evidence on CAL is based on after-school settings and primary-school-aged children, making it challenging to extrapolate to older students or in-school settings. Tutoring, while effective, faces scalability challenges due to cost and availability of qualified tutors. In this proof-of-concept, we aim to evaluate an in-school intervention combining CAL with group tutoring as a potentially more scalable alternative to  accelerate learning recovery among teenagers. Moreover, we aim to generate evidence on whether using CAL-generated data for targeted tutoring and teacher support can lead to better student outcomes. We plan to use in-depth data, including on teaching practices and teachersâ€™ time use, to investigate the underlying mechanisms behind the observed changes.
