abstract: "Rising concerns about the effects of technological distractions on concentration and learning outcomes are making us question which are the most efficient ways of studying and using smartphones. In order to investigate this issue, I assign first-year students at Bocconi University to the use of an app that helps them disconnect from distractions on their smartphones. The treatment lasts for several weeks up to the mid-term exams, and through surveys before and after the intervention I aim to detect relevant effects on academic performance, expectations about exam grades, course evaluations, and network influence.
