abstract: "We study how online job search assistance affects the job search behavior and labor market outcomes of unemployed workers. We conduct a country-wide field experiment on the dashboard of an online job search platform in Denmark. The dashboard provides job seekers with varying forms of job search assistance, including information about the occupational or geographical dimension of search, as well as the use
of different search methods. We link the data from our field experiment with comprehensive register data on job seekers’ labor market outcomes and click-by-click data on their online job search behavior. We examine the impact of concurrently offering diverse forms of advice on job seekers’ decision-making and assess whether it enhances or distorts their search behavior."
