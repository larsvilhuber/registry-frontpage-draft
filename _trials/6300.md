abstract: "Customary norms and institutions hold sway in legal pluralist contexts across sub-Saharan Africa. Women in these settings tend to have weaker rights than men over the acquisition, division, and inheritance of assets that are central to productivity and welfare. This project studies the relative impact of two interventions aimed at strengthening women’s property rights in rural Côte d’Ivoire, in the context of the World Bank Land Policy Improvement and Implementation Project (PAMOFOR). 

One way to strengthen women’s property rights is through the statutory declaration of those rights. Civil marriage registration offers a way to bring women under the protection of formal institutions, strengthen their property rights, and potentially enhance efficiency and welfare. Yet we know little about whether the formalization of customary marriage contracts effectively empowers women and if so, under what conditions. Moreover, we know little about how it compares to other strategies to strengthen women's property rights, such as formally registering a portion of household land in women's names. The relative impact of an immediate but one-off strategy (such as an asset redistribution within the household) versus a change in marital property regime (through a civil marriage) with effects that may take months or years to realize remains unclear.

The interventions, which will be executed jointly by the World Bank and the Government of Cote d’Ivoire, will coincide with the adoption of a new set of legal reforms in Côte d’Ivoire to strengthen women’s rights under marriage and inheritance.
