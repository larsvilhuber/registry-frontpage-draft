abstract: "Ethiopia’s Industrial Parks have created a large number of job opportunities for low-skilled workers in recent years, particularly women. However, existing research on women who receive offers of factory jobs in these parks has often found low take-up rates and high turnover, particularly at early stages of employment. This study explores potential explanations for this low take-up and high turnover, as well as women’s broader labor supply decisions in this context. The sample will be 600 women who express interest in factory jobs, by presenting themselves at the factory gate at the Bole Lemi Industrial Park when hiring opportunities are announced. We will conduct a baseline session consisting of a survey and incentivized activities to elicit preferences and behavioral traits. We will conduct a follow-up survey with the same women after approximately three months, to measure whether women took up factory jobs or other opportunities, and their short-term retention."
