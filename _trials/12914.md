abstract: "Large-scale resume audits were conducted  in the United States in 2016 and 2017, to straddle the May graduation dates of our fictive applicants. A total of 36,880 resumes were submitted to job advertisements from a constructed job bank. The job categories included were account executive, banking, customer service, finance, insurance, and marketing. Ads requiring certifications or foreign language skills were not included.  By saving the text from the job advertisements, we were able to link the ads to the O*Net and American Community Survey, via a machine learning algorithm that matched ads to standard occupation codes. 

The study covered the entire US labor market without geographical restrictions. Each job advertisement received four applications, with resumes created using a program by Lahey and Beasley (2009). Names on resumes were used to indicate race/ethnicity and gender.

The design allowed for various combinations of race/ethnicity and gender-specific names. The study included educational backgrounds and work experiences linked to public flagship universities in the US. Diverse majors (economics, finance, marketing, anthropology, philosophy, chemistry, biology, and psychology)  and two minors (history and mathematics), which were common to all the universities in our resumes. Other common elements of a resumes of college graduates, such as internships, GPAs, volunteer experiences, language skills, and computer proficiency were randomized."
