abstract: "Belief in one’s own ability to succeed in school can have large impacts on educational investment. Growth mindset interventions, which aim to increase individuals’ perceived abilities to learn, have been shown to reverse downward grade trajectories among low performing students in the United States. Despite evidence for their potential success in developing countries, no such intervention has been tested. This randomized trial will test whether a growth mindset intervention changes grade trajectories for secondary school students in Bangladesh, and by use of a novel placebo design, will increase our understanding of the mechanisms behind growth mindset's effects.
