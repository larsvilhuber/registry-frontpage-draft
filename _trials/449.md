abstract: "In the absence of formal markets for new seed varieties, farmer-to-farmer exchanges are a popular mechanism for diffusing these technologies. This approach implicitly relies on exchange via social networks. But, recent work has found that networks perform quite poorly at diffusing new seed varieties. Only 7% of farmers adopt from other farmers in their village. This compares to 40% when preferences were revealed via door-to-door sales (Emerick, 2013). These results suggest that the adoption gap – through the informal channel of social networks – is not demand driven. Rather, the existing sources of supply have not been sufficient to meet demand, or have not reached farmers with an effective demand for the new technology. In this study we ask whether coordination can explain the failure of informal exchange to efficiently allocate new seeds. We do this by testing the effectiveness of NGO-supported seed fairs on adoption. These events serve to solve coordination problems by simply bringing together original cultivators with potential adopters.
