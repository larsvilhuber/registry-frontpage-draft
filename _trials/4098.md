abstract: "We will conduct a randomized controlled trial to estimate the impact of Geisinger Health’s Fresh Food Farmacy program (FFF).  The program brings a “food-as-medicine” approach to address a key social determinant of health (food insecurity) for patients with diabetes.  A Fresh Food Farmacy dietitian prescribes enough fresh food for two meals per day, five days per week, for everyone in the patient’s household.  Prescriptions for the food are filled once a week at no charge at a local clinic.  Complementary services include dietitian consultation, recipes, cooking classes, biometric tracking, diabetes self-management training and checks that participants are following best practices such as eye and foot exams.  By randomly assigning patients to either start the FFF program immediately or in six months, we will be able to estimate the impact of the FFF program on a wide range of clinical outcomes, healthy behaviors, measures of wellbeing, and health care utilization."
