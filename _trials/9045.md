abstract: "This project considers the factors influencing political preferences, and preferences for redistribution. The point of departure is that people’s beliefs on job automation can affect their views on a range of issues. The primary goal of the project is to investigate how respondents’ perceived likelihood of job automation affect their political preferences, preferences for redistribution, and views on populism using new large-scale survey data.
