abstract: "This project's goal is to understand people’s moral attitudes towards different aspects of debt contracts. In particular, we aim to elicit how people’s moral values tradeoff with economic considerations. Participants are shown three scenarios covering both ex-ante and ex-post decisions relating to debt contracts. The first scenario asks participants to choose an interest rate spread between risky and safe borrowers based on randomized information about the demographics of risky borrowers. The second scenario asks participants to tradeoff unusual collateral with lower interest rates on a loan given randomized likelihood of default. The third scenario asks participants to make a decision about leniency in bankruptcy when shown randomized information about the cause of bankruptcy."
