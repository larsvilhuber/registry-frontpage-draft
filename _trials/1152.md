abstract: "The study implements the Pay for Percentile (PFP) incentive system for primary class 6 (P6) math teachers in 151 government schools in rural Uganda. The intervention is designed to address two issues.  First, teacher attendance and effort appear to be weak in many rural schools. Second, because the results of P7 leaving exams are publicized widely, schools face clear incentives to encourage weak P6 students to drop out. By comparing distributions of outcomes in the 151 treatment schools with outcomes in 151 control schools, we seek to determine whether PFP is an effective tool for improving teacher effort in ways that raise student achievement and mitigate educational triage.
