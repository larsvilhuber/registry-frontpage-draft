abstract: "The innovation of progressive taxation in the early 20th century accompanied some of the largest increases in tax revenue in Europe and the US and is a core feature of most tax systems in today's developed countries. In developing countries, however, states often use simplified tax instruments that are comparatively less progressive. This project will explore the randomized introduction of progressive property taxation in the D.R. Congo, a low-income country with weak fiscal capacity. In collaboration with the provincial government of Kasai-Central, the study will compare neighborhoods in the city of Kananga assigned to (1) a progressive property tax rate schedule, (2) a proportional schedule, or (3) the status quo flat fee schedule. We will study the effects on total revenue, household compliance, perceptions of fairness and tax morale, and general attitudes toward the government. Cross-randomized household-level information treatments will help distinguish between ability-to-pay and tax-morale mechanisms."
