abstract: "We study the importance of information and network frictions facing potential rural-urban migrants in Kenya using a cluster-randomized trial with a representative set of households across 5 Kenyan counties. Pre-experimental work shows that rural workers' beliefs about income in the largest Kenyan city, Nairobi, are severely downward biased on average, and that many potential migrants have limited or no social connections in Nairobi. Given the importance of social networks in forming beliefs, assisting with job search, and providing localized information, it is possible that limited information and weak networks act as a barrier to migration. 

Our information intervention provides detailed information about earnings in Nairobi. Our ``group'' and ``guide'' interventions supplement this information by attempting to leverage origin and destination social networks, respectively, to facilitate migration. Our ``group'' intervention presents the same information in a group setting, and encourages villagers to share information with each other about Nairobi, discuss their plans to migrate in the future, and potentially coordinate their trips. Our ``guide'' intervention pairs prospective migrants with established local residents in Nairobi, who talk with them over the phone or in person to share information about the city. In some villages receiving information about Nairobi, we survey both treated and untreated households, allowing us to study the determinants of information diffusion through social networks."
