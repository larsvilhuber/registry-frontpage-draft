abstract: "The Behavioral Insights to Advance Self-Sufficiency-Next Generation (BIAS-NG) project, sponsored by the Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation in the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, uses principles of behavioral science in an effort to improve human services program design and outcomes. BIAS-NG partners with state and local agencies to diagnose behavioral barriers to program success, design interventions to address those barriers, and test the efficacy and cost efficiency of those behaviorally informed interventions relative to status quo service delivery. In Monroe County, NY, BIAS-NG worked with the Division of Financial Assistance (DFA), Monroe County Department of Social Services (MCDSS). DFA administers Monroe County’s Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Safety Net Assistance (SNA) programs.

Working closely with DFA, BIAS-NG identified behavioral barriers that program clients faced in successfully completing meetings and activities they were required to attend as a condition of public benefit receipt: the Employment Assessment (EA) meeting, the Work Experience Program (WEP) Enrollment meeting, and the WEP internship assignment. These meetings are designed to help clients fulfill their work requirements, avoid sanctions to their benefits, and, in the longer term, build work skills and increase their economic self-sufficiency. Increased attendance at these meetings and subsequent adherence to work activity requirements can also improve the county’s performance according to outcomes required for state and federal reporting.
As part of the “behavioral diagnosis and design process,” the research team worked to understand program challenges by: interviewing clients, staff, and administrators; observing orientation and individual meetings; and examining outreach materials. We conducted two tests to address the problems identified in the diagnosis of behavioral barriers to program success:
Test 1: A behavioral outreach intervention with behaviorally redesigned letters, a reminder magnet for clients to post in a visible place in their homes (for example, refrigerators), and text message reminders.
Test 2: A behaviorally informed WEP orientation to increase the rate of attendance at the WEP assignment.

For the impact evaluations for Test 1 and Test 2, clients were randomly assigned to the intervention or status quo services separately for each test. The behavioral outreach intervention (Test 1) was targeted to increase attendance at EA and WEP meetings. The behaviorally informed WEP orientation (Test 2) was targeted to increase attendance at WEP internship assignments.  The impact evaluation will examine those outcomes on the full sample and on specified subgroups. In addition to the impact study, we are conducting accompanying implementation and cost analyses to document how the intervention was delivered and at what cost.
