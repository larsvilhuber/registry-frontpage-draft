abstract: "With the aging of the baby boom generation and its increasing retirement rates, policymakers are facing demographic pressures that may require them to promote the employment of older workers. In this paper, we conduct a correspondence experiment with more than 1,700 job applications to address age discrimination in the Spanish labor market. We investigate how age influences two stages of the hiring process: attention to the CV and the selection decision. "
