abstract: "Decisions about investing in human capital, including the choice of tertiary education enrollment and field of study, significantly influence future job prospects, career paths, and earnings. However, evidence overwhelmingly suggests that individuals do not strictly maximize income in these decisions. We focus on the selection of the field of study, rather than the decision to enroll in tertiary education. This distinction is important not only because different fields of study have widely varying expected returns, but also because choosing the wrong field may lead to dissatisfaction or increase the likelihood of dropping out. In Italy, where we conduct our study, an astonishing 30% of graduates report that, if given the chance to go back in time, they would not enroll in the same degree program. The high dropout rate and dissatisfaction with chosen programs highlight concerns about insufficient information or guidance during the transition from high school to university. We implement an RCT to study the impact of a personalized mentoring program on university enrollment choices and academic outcomes."
