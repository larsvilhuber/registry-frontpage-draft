abstract: "This trial is a replication trial of AEARCTR-0003957. We evaluate a large-scale randomized educational intervention that aims to cultivate and stimulate curiosity in the classroom environment. The study is motivated by the evidence on the importance of curiosity as a fundamental driver of academic achievement. 
Teachers are given 5 months to implement the proposed pedagogy supported by the activities prescribed in the curriculum. This trial involves 52 schools in the province of Sakarya, Turkey, and targets the 4th-grade students. The objective of this trial is to i) replicate the findings of the previous trial, ii) increase the statistical power of the first trial by adding 52 more elementary schools to the evaluation sample."
