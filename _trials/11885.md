abstract: "As people recognize the capabilities of AI, it raises the question of whether this positive attitude will extend to products that utilize AI technology. Specifically, in household finance, financial companies have introduced AI-assisted investment robo-advisors to optimize investment outcomes for investors. To investigate further, we plan to collaborate with a Chinese household investment mobile application. We aim to provide users with information about AI and then observe whether these users demonstrate a heightened preference for robo-advisor investment products when making choices among various financial products.

We are outlining an experiment where we aim to replace the splash screen of the mobile software for the experimental group with slogans associated with AI hot topics, carefully linking these slogans to various fields and professionals. On the other hand, the control group will be presented with a splash screen featuring sayings that are unrelated to AI. By comparing the responses of the experimental and control groups, we can gauge whether AI hot topics have a positive impact on users' inclination toward adopting AI-assisted investment portfolios. Furthermore, by examining the influence of individuals from different professions and levels of prominence, we intend to analyze whether authoritative figures influence users' perspectives on AI investment capabilities."
