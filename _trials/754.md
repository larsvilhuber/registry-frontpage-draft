abstract: "This field experiment tests an intervention to increase community engagement in the adaptation to, and prevention and mitigation of, flood risks through maintaining the cleanliness of public spaces and drainage infrastructure in highly flood-prone peri-urban areas of Dakar, Senegal. The study (World Bank Project P145184) takes place in the context of the World Bank and Nordic Development Fund-assisted Stormwater Management and Climate Change Adaptation Project (PROGEP; World Bank Project P122841), implemented by the Dakar Municipal Development Agency. The major investment under PROGEP is the construction of new and the rehabilitation of existing drainage infrastructure in flood-prone areas. Such investments, however, suffer from the tragedy of the commons – individuals have the incentive to abuse shared resources as they personally incur the benefits while the costs are shared by the whole community. In particular, in PROGEP areas public spaces are used to dispose of waste, clogging storm-water drainage systems and reducing their effectiveness, sustainability, and the returns on this major investment. There is a lack of knowledge on the negative effects of poor waste management and a lack of accountability to discourage adverse behavior. Currently, there is little evidence on how best to engage communities in the preservation of public spaces and infrastructures, particularly in urban settings, and this study will experimentally test “Operation Quartier Propre” (Operation Clean Neighborhood), a new intervention where local community-based organizations are charged with the cleanliness of their neighborhood, are provided with an initial in-kind endowment to support them in this task, and are eligible for non-monetary incentives based on an external assessment of their respective community’s cleanliness. Conditional on implementation, the study will also attempt to non-experimentally estimate the impact of community-proposed micro-projects financed through PROGEP."
