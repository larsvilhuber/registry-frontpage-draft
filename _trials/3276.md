abstract: "We describe the analysis plan for a series of lab-in-the-field experiments designed to examine how witchcraft affects pro-social behavior. The study will be conducted with individuals living in and near Gemena, a city in Sud-Ubangi province which is in northern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Participants will complete three experimental games that involve another player. In each game, the other player is anonymous, but they are given some information about them. They are informed of their age, sex, educational level, ethnic group, strength of belief in the Christian God, strength of belief in witchcraft, and whether the individual is from Gemena. The primary experimental treatment is that individuals are randomly assigned to another player that has either a strong or weak belief in witchcraft. We outline the study design, the treatments, and the econometric strategy for the analysis."
