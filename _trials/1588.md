abstract: "Consumers might choose to purchase certain products to show to others their own economic achievements and thus gain social status. We investigate how self-esteem influences the demand for social status: are self-esteem and social image complements or substitute? We consider high-end brand clothing (Armani), which can be demanded not only for its quality, but also for social image motives. We design an online marketing experiment which has two purposes: first, to temporarily give a boost to the self-esteem of some customers; and second, to elicit preferences between gift cards for high-end brand clothing (Armani) versus a low-end brand clothing (Old  Navy) using an incentivized Multiple Price List procedure."
