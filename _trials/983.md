abstract: "Through the Adolescent Girls Empowerment Program (AGEP), the Population Council is implementing a social, health, and economic asset-building program for vulnerable adolescent girls aged 10–19 in Zambia. At its core, the AGEP incorporates a Safe Spaces program, implemented in partnership with YWCA Zambia. At weekly girls’ group meetings, 20 to 30 girls meet with a mentor—a young woman from their community—for short training sessions on a variety of topics as well as a chance to discuss important experiences of the past week. The primary goal of the safe spaces groups is to reduce the social isolation while increasing the assets of adolescent girls. The Safe Spaces groups meet for a period of two years.

Two additional components have been added to the Safe Spaces model for the AGEP program. In the first component, selected girls in the AGEP are assisted in opening bank accounts to manage their money. The Population Council is working in partnership with the National Savings and Credit Bank (NatSave) and Making Cents International to develop the “Girls Dream” Savings Account. The second add-on component of AGEP is a health voucher that will be provided to selected girls in the program. In partnership with the Ministry of Health (MoH) and Mobile Transactions Zambia, the Council is developing a health voucher that will be redeemable for a package of health services at certain public and private health providers, including MoH public facilities. The services covered by the voucher include basic wellness exams as well as age-appropriate sexual and reproductive health services. 

In addition to expanding the assets and potential of adolescent girls in Zambia, a principal feature of AGEP is rigorous research and evaluation of program impact. In conjunction with program activities, Council researchers will conduct a four-year impact evaluation of the program using a randomized cluster design. The study will follow participants for the two-year intervention period and for two years after completion of the intervention to assess longer-term impact. Communities where AGEP is being implemented will be randomly assigned one of three different versions of the intervention: (1) the full program (safe spaces, savings accounts, and health vouchers), (2) safe spaces with a health voucher, or (3) safe spaces only. Program participants will be compared with a control group of adolescent girls not participating. 

The research and evaluation will assess the impact of AGEP on vulnerable adolescent girls’ longer-term demographic, reproductive, and health outcomes. In addition to survey data, biomarker data will be collected among older participants to measure incidence and prevalence of STIs, specifically Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV-2). In addition, anemia testing will be conducted among study participants aged 15+ years and their children aged 6−59 months to measure prevalence of anemia. The research will investigate how AGEP changes vulnerable adolescent girls’ lives as they age from 10–19 in 2013 (baseline) to 14–23 in 2017; the study participants will be revisited annually. The adolescent cohort study will include: 1) quantitative structured interviews; 2) in-depth semi-structured interviews; 3) HIV and HSV-2 testing (at three points in time); 4) anemia testing, and 5) assessment of adolescents’ children gross and fine motor skills.
