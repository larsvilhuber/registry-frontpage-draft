abstract: "Connections between firms are critical for industrial upgrading and economic growth.  One possible barrier to firm-to-firm matching is information frictions: firms may not know the potential suppliers and buyers, or the specific product they offer or demand. These frictions may be especially prominent for smaller firms run by lower-income owners, who lack business connections and networks. 

In this project, we aim to understand whether trade fairs can reduce information frictions. By coordinating a centralized meeting point for buyers and suppliers in a specific industry, trade fairs aim to reduce search costs and facilitate matching among firms. To test the impact of attending trade fairs on firm-to-firm connections, we partner with FISA, the organizer of Aquasur 2024, the largest trade fair for the fishing industry in the southern hemisphere, which will be held in Puerto Montt, Chile. We will first solicit firms’ interest in participating in the fair via an online application to a raffle to win a subsidy to attend the fair. Among the firms that express interest, we will randomly provide a subsidy on the registration fee to encourage firms’ actual attendance at the fair. Finally, among participating firms, we will organize a matchmaking event at the fair to facilitate supplier-buyer connections. 

We will measure impacts using a combination of original surveys of firms, collected both at the fair and after, with rich firm-to-firm transaction-level data from VAT tax records. First, we will measure how much reducing information frictions by bringing firms together at the fair facilitates new business connections. Second, we will assess whether the new supplier linkages substitute transactions from other suppliers, thereby testing the business-stealing effects. Third, we will study additional ripple effects of the new linkages to the economy, such as upstream and downstream propagation and firm-level quality upgrading. Finally, we will combine the reduced form findings from the experiment with a structural model, building on the approach in Baqaee, Burstein, Duprez, Farhi (2024), to quantify the value of new business linkages and how that impacts aggregate productivity and growth.
