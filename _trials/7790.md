abstract: "In many parts of the world, women’s mobility and access to opportunities are still limited by demands on their time at home, conservative gender norms, and poor transportation. As smartphone and social media usage rates escalate in developing countries, it is increasingly important to understand whether these accessible technologies can be used to deliver remote, flexible, and more inclusive programs to women. Working with microfinance clients in Jordan, which has one of the lowest female labor force participation rates in the world, I study the take-up and impact of a virtual business training program designed to leverage social media apps and to be delivered on smartphones. To evaluate the training’s impact, I aim to randomize interested applicants to (1) a control arm, (2) a training only arm, or (3) a training and social media exposure arm. The social media exposure arm places participants in chat groups and exposes them to a “curated social media feed” of online business pages and tutorials.  Given the low rates of economic participation by women, the intervention is meant to explore whether existing digital networking sites can be leveraged to enhance women’s access to collaboration and learning opportunities that they might otherwise lack in their immediate communities.
