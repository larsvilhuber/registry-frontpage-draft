abstract: "We will evaluate the importance of women's economic development for their empowerment at the individual, household and community levels. For this purpose, we will evaluate a multifaceted programme which provides a conditional loan, free assets and training to ultra-poor women for their economic development. This programme helps women to engage in economic activities which might increase their empowerment at different levels. To test this hypothesis, we will estimate the impacts of this programme on women empowerment using a randomized control trial with three waves of surveys. A baseline and an endline surveys were conducted in 2016 and 2019, respectively and these surveys collected data on women empowerment, particularly, women's risk-aversion, patience, participation in intra-household decision-making, intimate partner violence (IPV), mental health and social inclusion. We will conduct another wave of endline survey, covering all indicators of empowerment from the previous surveys and on top of them, it will cover other indicators of empowerment, including the quality of the spousal relationship, spousal transfer, labor division between spouses, allocation of household resources, altruism and trust. These two rounds of endline surveys will also allow us to evaluate the short- and long-term impacts of women economic development on their empowerment. Moreover, we will examine potential mechanisms by investigating relevant mediating and moderating factors."
