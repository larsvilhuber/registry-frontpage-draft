abstract: "In rural areas of low and middle-income countries cash is the dominant form of payments. By contrast, in high-income countries and in many urban areas around the world, payments are primarily—and, in some cases, almost exclusively—digital. Governments, companies, and international organizations all tend to agree that shifting existing cash payments to digital payments carries the potential to improve the lives of people living in rural areas of low-income countries, especially women (see, e.g., the Better Than Cash Alliance). In contexts where physical banking networks are limited and the use of traditional bank accounts, ATMs, and debit/credit cards is low, many view mobile money as a potential technology enabling a shift away from dependence on cash payments (Suri et al. 2021). In this project, we aim to study preferences for digital payments relative to cash payments by embedding an experiment at the end of a household survey in Bangladesh. The experiment involves randomizing, at the individual level, the amount and mode of appreciation payment distributed to our survey respondents after they complete our survey. Importantly, this payment takes place where both parties (i.e., the enumerator and the survey respondent) are physically in the same location, which removes the reduction in transaction costs associated with digital payments in previous studies. This design allows us to compare preferences for digital payments vs. cash payments while removing confounding variation in travel costs associated with digital payments.
