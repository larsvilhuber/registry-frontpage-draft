abstract: "In this experiment, we examine the conditions under which individuals consider the exploitation of loopholes acceptable. The experiment involves two types of participants: workers and spectators. Workers are matched into groups of four and are supposed to pay a tax designed to equalize their incomes. However, they have the option to work on a calculation task to reduce their tax rate at the expense of other participants. The calculation task contains a loophole, which allows workers to strongly lower their tax rate. Spectators judge whether exploiting the loophole is appropriate or not. They can decide whether to sanction workers who exploited the loophole. In separate treatments, we vary whether pre-tax incomes reflect earned merits and the efficiency costs of redistribution.

This experiment relates to experiment AEARCTR-0011610 (https://doi.org/10.1257/rct.11610-1.0). While the other experiment looked at the treatment variation for the decision to close the loophole, this experiment studies the treatment variation for the sanctioning decision."
