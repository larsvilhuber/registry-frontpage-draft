abstract: "In this pre-analysis plan we describe an experiment we are implementing in Romania to investigate whether parents and/or children use information about schools' value added in making school choices, in particular in choosing a high school track, which in Romania is assigned by a cutoff rule based on a national admissions score. We do this by providing information about the value added of high school choices to a randomly assigned treatment group, and then comparing their track choices to those of a control group that did not receive the information.
