abstract: "Studentsâ€™ college major choice has important consequences for their career path, lifetime earnings, and labor supply. The literature documents that although there are many determinants of college major choice, the unobserved taste component seems to play a key role in college major decisions and in explaining field of study differences across different demographic groups. In this project, we aim to directly test the role of tastes in major choices with the help of an experiment. The experiment will allow us to assess how major choices respond to receiving taste-related information. This project will unravel the black box of the taste component of college major choice and shed light on potential policy interventions that can be used to narrow the college major gap across different demographic groups."
