abstract: "Our research project aims to comprehensively understand the demand and supply barriers affecting access to, usage of, and transition to various financial products among Venezuelan migrants. Additionally, we aim to gain insights into migrants' perceptions of financial inclusion and pertinent migrant issues. A pivotal aspect of this stage involves a nuanced examination of how engagement with the financial system may be influenced by perceptions of discrimination or the provision of information about its extent. To assess these dynamics, we employ an outcome telephone survey structured to include both a control group and a treatment group. These groups are formed through the random assignment of questionnaire sections eliciting perceptions on discrimination and providing information about its extent within the sample. This strategic approach enables a systematic exploration of varied perceptions' impact on financial engagement, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing the financial behaviors of Venezuelan migrants."
