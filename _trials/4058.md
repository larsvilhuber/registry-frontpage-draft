abstract: "This study is meant to examine the nature of the asymmetric dominance effect. To reach this goal we extend the standard experimental framework of asymmetric dominance by introducing subjects with multiple decoy options in different locations. As a side effect we may be able to hint as to which type of economic models is more fitting to account for this behavioral phenomenon."
