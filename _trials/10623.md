abstract: "Children between the ages of 3 and 10 can take the 6-Dimesional Personality Intelligence Scale for Children, an individual intelligence test. It takes 40 to 60 minutes to administer the test. It produces a Full Scale IQ, also referred to as an IQ score or intelligence quotient, which measures a child's whole intellectual capacity. Additionally, it includes Arithmetic Problems, Identification of Items, Identification of body parts, English Portion, Scenario Based Questions and General Knowledge Questions which will test fluid reasoning, working memory, and cognitive skills. These indices show how well a youngster performs across many cognitive domains. The current experiment will primarily focus on the 6-Dimensional Personality Intelligence Scale-Child version, which includes both audio and visual instructions. There will be a total of six cubes with six activities each, with varying degrees of difficulty. We can administer the test by displaying various cube faces. Each side of a cube contains a separate assignment that we might use to estimate the child's intellectual capacity."
