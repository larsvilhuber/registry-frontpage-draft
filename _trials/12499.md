abstract: "There is generally an underrepresentation of women and non-white innovators in the therapeutics and medical technology innovation space. Similarly, venture capitalists (VCs)—who are some of the key contributors of financial capital for therapeutics and medical technology research and development—are disproportionately overrepresented by white men. We will conduct a natural field experiment to see whether the demographic composition of potential VC funders influences the demographic composition of the scientists who submit their therapeutics and medical technology ideas to a VC pitch contest. We will also examine whether the qualitative framing around the ideas change depending on the demographic composition of the potential VC funders who will evaluate the ideas.
