abstract: "Behavioral constraints may explain part of low demand for preventive health products. We test the effects of two light-touch psychological interventions on water chlorination and related health and economic outcomes using a randomized controlled trial among 3750 women in rural Kenya. One intervention encourages participants to visualize alternative realizations of the future; one builds participants' ability to make concrete plans to achieve goals. Both interventions include information on health benefits of chlorination. 

UPDATE: A long-term follow-up survey was conducted with the entire experimental sample between July--December 2020 to measure treatment effects between 30-36 months after the interventions took place. An amendment to the original PAP which pre-specifies the analysis of the new data has been posted."
