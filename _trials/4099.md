abstract: "The Midwestern landscape is among the most altered and intensively managed ecosystems in the world. A perennial challenge associated with annual row crop production is its impacts on water quality. Public and private organizations have dedicated tremendous resources to improve on-farm practices, retire land, and restore wetlands. Despite these efforts, health-based drinking water quality violations continue to affect millions of Americans annually.  Little is known about the degree to which these violations expose rural residents to unsafe drinking water, what efforts rural residents take to avoid possible exposure, and how information provision might improve the welfare of rural residents. We aim to fill in this knowledge gap. In this project, we propose to study rural households’ drinking water patterns, pollution avoidance behavior, and willingness to pay for pollution information. Specifically, we propose to (i) field a large-scale, longitudinal survey of rural households' drinking water sources and bottled water/filter purchases; (ii) study the impacts of providing households with  in-home nitrate test kits on these purchases; (iii) elicit households’ willingness to pay for in-home nitrate pollution test kits, comparing stated versus revealed preference elicitation methods; and (iv) engage rural communities and create multi-faceted extension and education programming to improve knowledge and awareness of drinking water challenges and solutions.  Results will be used to guide effective policy-making for water quality programs throughout the United States.

Methods: Primary data will be collected using household surveys. Supplemental data will include socio-demographic information from the U.S.Census and publicly available data on households' participation in state-sponsored drinking water testing programs. We will
study the impact of pollution information on households' survey responses using a randomized control trial, i.e., a random
subset of households' will be assigned to receive a nitrate test kit in between the first and second survey round. Willingness to
pay estimates will be elicited from the subset of homes that receive nitrate test kits in the second survey round. Survey
responses will be evaluated using standard statistical and econometric techniques. Results will include summary statistics of
key outcomes of interest (e.g., frequency of bottled water and water filter purchases), estimated impacts of pollution information
provision on those outcomes, and average willingness to pay estimates for more nitrate test kits."
