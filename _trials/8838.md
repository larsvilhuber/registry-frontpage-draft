abstract: "Social information, price salience and personal message are widely used as a nudge to influence the behavioural change. In this research, we use a randomized field experiment (RCT) to examine the effects of behaviorally motivated demand-side management (DSM) interventions on energy use among residential customers in urban Dhaka. We address the question:  Can Home Energy Reporting (HER) subject to contextualized message contents be effective in the context of a developing country like Bangladesh? In our field experiment on householdsâ€™ energy conservation, we combine the administration provided monthly energy-use data from our implementation partner and survey data to test our research questions. Accordingly, we construct the interventions and rigorously evaluate the programs to understand the effects using carefully planned RCTs. Given these novelties, our research findings will contribute to the relevant literature as well as the essential energy policies of Bangladesh, from where other countries, particularly in developing countries can also learn."
