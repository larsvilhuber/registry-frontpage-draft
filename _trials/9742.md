abstract: "In this project, we study the relative performance of the "raffle" mechanism compared to standard resource allocation mechanisms used today. Paper by Immorlica, Lucier, Mollner, and Weyl (20017) proposes a practical and straightforward ``raffle” mechanism for allocating a limited supply of heterogeneous goods among consumers. They show theoretically that the raffle mechanism could outperform ordinal algorithms in terms of efficiency because consumers can signal not only their ordinal but cardinal utilities as well. To test this hypothesis among human subjects, we designed an experiment."
