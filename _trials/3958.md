abstract: "This study intends to identify the effects of a conditional cash transfer program (“Hacemos Futuro” or HF) on criminal recidivism of population under probation schemes in the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. This program was designed by Ministerio de Salud y Desarrollo Social (MDS) and implemented by Patronato de Liberados Bonaerense (PLB); a public institution which aims to prevent crime through social inclusion of inmates released from incarceration, working in order to overcome socioeconomic vulnerability. 
The probation population benefited from the program is selected by a randomized selection. The beneficiaries of HF receives a monthly subsidy of about USD 150 conditional on social information update, educational terminality and vocational training. This subsidy aims to alleviate the budgetary burdens on people under socio-economic vulnerability, while the conditionality seeks to promote the development of people through higher levels of education and job skills in order to guarantee opportunities for market labor insertion.
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of HF program on the rate of criminal recidivism of population under probation schemes in Buenos Aires. Additionally, it intends to analyze the mechanisms of transmission inherent to the potential impact of the program on criminal behavior, such as market labor insertion, access to education, housing and health, among others."
