abstract: "The design of effective programs for fostering entrepreneurial activity is an important activity for stakeholders across the board. However, limited evidence exists regarding what works and what does not. We build on recent causal evidence on the performance enhancing effects of business accelerators that speculates about the existence of a specific mechanism: structured accountability. This trial seeks to test the effect of structured accountability on entrepreneurial performance. That is, whether encouraging entrepreneurs to articulate specific objectives and following up on their implicit commitment causes entrepreneurs to outperform. Understanding the economic significance of such a programmatic design will help policymakers and investors allocate their resources more effectively, and (assuming a treatment effect) guide entrepreneurs to build a hierarchical structure that they may naturally tend to avoid.
