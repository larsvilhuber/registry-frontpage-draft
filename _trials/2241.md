abstract: "Our project investigates whether the Norwegian universal daycare system can improve children's developmental trajectories by more systematically cultivate key school readiness skills known to promote future learning. To do so, we collaborate with daycare teachers to design and implement a randomized controlled trial in which we offer five-year-olds at Norwegian daycare centers a school readiness intervention program. The intervention program cultivates four sets of school readiness skills - self-regulatory, social-emotional, language and math skills - which numerous studies have identified as foundational for future learning and development. 71 daycare centers and 701 children participate in the field experiment, with 36 randomly selected centers in the treatment group.
The intervention year is the school year 2016/2017. We assess the children's self-regulatory, social-emotional, language and math skills in August 2016 (pre-intervention), June 2017 (first post-test) and June 2018 (second post-test). Additionally, we investigate effects on official mapping tests conducted by schools, and longer term outcomes on school performance collected from registry data. For all outcomes, we will investigate differential intervention effects across parental education, income, immigrant background, gender and pre-intervention competencies.
