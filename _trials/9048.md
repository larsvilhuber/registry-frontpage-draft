abstract: "We conduct lab experiments to examine how group diversity may affect the integration of newcomers and, as a result, influence the group members’ and the group’s performance in a dynamic environment. We experimentally vary the group compositions and newcomers' social identities and then investigate the impact of the groups' diversity and the newcomers' identities on the groups' and the old and new members' economic decisions, cooperation, and coordination."
