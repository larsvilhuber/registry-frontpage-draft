abstract: "Most farmers living near protected areas are inherently isolated and unable to access affordable and safe credit. This constrains their ability to invest in their production and makes them more likely to continue with low input farming practices such as slash and burn agriculture (involving burning and rotational farming). These unsustainable practices drive forest clearing and biodiversity loss and increase farmer vulnerability to the negative effects of climate change. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) can help develop more sustainable agricultural systems and enhance farmer resilience, thus reducing food insecurity - while generating biodiversity and climate change mitigation co-benefits from reduced deforestation. Despite their demonstrated benefits, adoption of CSA remains very low and robust empirical evidence on the key policy instruments and behavioral factors that support their widespread adoption is very thin. One of the key constraints to adoption is limited access to knowledge. Another major constraint is high upfront investment costs associated with input purchases and labor costs. This study aims to address these constraints in Madagascar by evaluating the impacts of knowledge and credit transfers on CSA adoption and other welfare indicators using a mixed-method approach (a randomized controlled trial, experimental games, and qualitative interviews).

This project aims to address the following research questions:
1. Do credit and knowledge transfer (training in CSA) increase investments in CSA and improve local welfare (farm and non-farm income,
food security and resilience)?
2. Does the effectiveness of the CSA training depend on the availability of the credit?
3. What are the underlying mechanisms driving observed changes in behavior?
4. How do behavioral factors such as risk aversion and willingness to engage in collective action affect farmerâ€™s intention to invest in CSA?
5. Can village savings and loans associations (VSLAs) be a suitable vehicle for encouraging investment in more sustainable farming techniques and income generation?"
