abstract: "IDinsight, GiveDirectly and Movva are partnering to rigorously evaluate a Movva SMS-based intervention aimed at increasing parental engagement to improve schooling outcomes for children of GiveDirectly recipients in Lilongwe Rural.  The objective of this study is to assess the impact of the SMS intervention on childrenâ€™s attendance, time spending, learning, motivation to go to school and parental engagement with children.

Several relevant studies suggest that the intervention may be a promising solution to improve schooling outcomes in Malawi. SMS interventions for parents have been shown to create literacy gains for preschool children (York et al. 2019, Doss et al. 2019) and help parents track school progress (Bergman 2019). Increased parental engagement in their children's education through games and positive reinforcement has been shown to improve economic, psychological, and socio-emotional outcomes many years later (Gertler et al. 2021, Walker et al. 2021). Angrist et al. 2021 demonstrate that SMS messages with learning activities improve learning by 0.12 SD in Botswana. The intervention used by Movva has been evaluated in Brazil and Cote D'Ivoire. In Brazil, the authors found that general text messages that increase the salience of children's outcomes bring about increases in attendance, test scores, and promotion rates (Cunha et al., 2017). The largest impacts are found for SMSs sent three times a week without requiring parents to respond. Delivery times or consistency of delivery times do not have differential impacts.

The SMS intervention, developed by Movva, will be implemented in TA Khongoni over a 4 to 6 months period. The SMSs will consist of multiple education subthemes to be covered in sequence over weeks. Each subtheme has a sequence of 4 messages, with 2 messages being sent to parents weekly.  The first message sent in the first week of a sequence will contain a fact and the second message will contain an activity for the parent to do with their child. In the second week, the first message will be interactive with a question for the parent to respond to and the final message of the sequence will reinforce the general message of the sequence. 

The main objective of the study is to understand how SMSs affect parental engagement, school attendance and child use time. "
