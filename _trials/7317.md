abstract: "Locus of control is a personality trait that defines oneâ€™s general belief regarding the nature of the causal relationship between own behaviour and experienced outcomes (Rotter, 1966). Those believing that life outcomes are due to their own efforts have an internal locus of control, while those believing they are due to external circumstances, such as luck, have an external locus of control. Research revealed an association between having an internal locus of control and behaving in way that is conducive to desirable outcomes in several domains of life including education, health, employment, finances and parenting. 
We will investigate the underlying relationship between locus of control and life outcomes by establishing the link between locus of control and the determinants of decision-making. Specifically, we will establish the predictive power of locus of control measured with a self-reported psychometric scale and a set of economic preferences and beliefs that guide decision-making and are conceptually related to locus of control. These include the preference for agency, optimism about returns from effort, self-confidence and the illusion of control.  They will be elicited in a laboratory environment with incentivised tasks and in a unified context of decision-making.
