abstract: "We examine the role of social preferences for individualsâ€™ responses to changes in inequality perceptions. In previous research (Epper-Fehr-Senn 2020) we have shown that social preferences strongly reduce the decline of support for redistribution that occurs at higher incomes: Higher income levels are associated with a strong decline in political support for redistribution for selfish individuals but inequality averse individuals and individuals with social welfare concerns exhibit a much smaller decline. Here, we study how individuals respond to a downwards shock in their beliefs about inequality and how their response interacts with their social preferences. We hypothesize that an information shock that induces individuals to reduce their belief about the share of income received by the top 1% of income earners in Switzerland will lead to an average decrease in support for redistribution. We further conjecture that this reduction is particularly pronounced for inequality averse individuals with an above-median income (relative to selfish individuals with an above-median income). This conjecture follows from the results reported in Epper-Fehr-Senn (2020), indicating that inequality averse individuals with above-median incomes display larger political support for redistribution than selfish individuals with an above-median income."
