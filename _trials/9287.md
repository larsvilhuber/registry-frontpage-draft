abstract: "2020 marked a sharp rise in individual investors in the risky investment market like equity and cryptocurrency. The Nature versus Nurture debate from psychology suggests that factors contributing to this change may range from individual-specific factors to those concerning individuals' social environment. Peer effect is one such channel in social environment that affects an individual's decisions. While peers affect us in several contexts and in different ways, it is not clear whether the risk-attribute of our conversations with peers affect our investment decisions. In this paper, we use a lab experiment to study whether and how such conversations with peers, varying in their risk-attributes, affect an individual's investment decision."
