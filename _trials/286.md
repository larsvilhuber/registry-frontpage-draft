abstract: "This study uses a field experiment to answer how information problems between parents and their children affect education outcomes and whether a cost-effective intervention can ameliorate these problems to improve student achievement. In Los Angeles, a random sample of parents was provided detailed information about their child's academic progress. Teachers were also asked to predict students that would benefit most from this intervention.
