abstract: "In this randomized experiment, we study the effects of free public transit on travel behaviours by randomly offering university students a free, all-agency transit pass (called the Clipper Baypass). We randomly assigned students from three American universities (n = 106,104) to either the control or the treatment group. The experimental design allows us to measure the effect of offering the new passes by comparing ridership for all students who received the offer and all who did not."
