abstract: "We study individual economic rationality under visual and auditory information forms. Economics research (e.g., Eliaz and Spiegler (2011); Masatlioglu, Nakajima and Ozbay (2012); Dean, Kibris and Masatlioglu (2017); Lleras et al. (2017)) suggests that limited attention may impede economic rationality because people may not have enough cognitive capacity to process all available alternatives. Economic rationality may decrease in cognitive capacity,  as suggested by empirical evidence (e.g., Burks et al. (2009)). Auditory cognitive capacity appears to be inferior to visual cognitive capacity, according to evidence from cognitive sciences (Cohen, Horowitz and Wolfe (2009); Kaiser (2015); Plakke and Romanski (2016)). Based on the evidence, we hypothesize that Individuals make choices with lower economic rationality in decision problems based on auditory information than in tasks based on visual information."
