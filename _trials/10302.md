abstract: "Education has long-lasting effects in life outcomes of individuals. For some time now, market designers investigate matching mechanisms for school allocation, aiming to enhance fairness and ensure equal opportunities for children. Widely discussed are the Immediate-Acceptance (IA) and the Deferred-Acceptance (DA) mechanism, where the latter one has been agreed upon as more desirable due to its strategy-proofness which makes truthful preference submission a dominant strategy.
However, lab and field investigations have revealed that often applicants do not understand the strategy-proofness of the mechanism. This becomes especially problematic if applicants differ in submission strategies correlating with their socio-economic status (SES). The intended fairness might actually end up in an even higher socio-economic gap in educational outcomes.
In an online experiment, parents matched in groups of 16 with induced preferences over 4 schools have to choose a school ranking. After explaining them either the IA or DA mechanism we ask them to submit an application form for a school choice problem in which they compete over the 16 seats at the 4 schools. We pre-select parents by SES. In an additional treatment variation, we examine whether advice on the submission strategy (‘skip-the-middle school’ in IA and ‘submit the true preference order’ in DA) affects the socio-economic gap in school admissions. To gain a deeper understanding of what drives parents’ choices, we additionally elicit survey measures including, e.g., cognitive ability, beliefs about other parents’ behavior and returns to school quality, or trust in institutions."
