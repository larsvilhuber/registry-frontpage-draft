abstract: "In South Africa, the health system is characterised by stark inequalities, with most of the population only able to seek care in free government facilities. The low quality of the public sector, where patients wait long times to be seen by nurses, is believed to lead many to delay needed care and prevent health outcome improvement. The government of South Africa is developing proposals to introduce a national health insurance scheme that would provide free access to private providers who deliver higher care quality. However, concerns about the unequal geographical distribution of private providers raise questions about the potential benefits of the reform. This study asks several questions to inform this reform: (1) Does access to higher-quality care reduce under-use of services for children? (2) does it also increase overuse? (3)
Are these effects mitigated by the distance to the contracted providers? 
We answer these questions by using an RCT where approx. 1,300 parents/guardians of children under 6 will be randomly allocated to a control group with the default free access to government facilities or one of the two treatment groups where they will have free access to private providers located either relatively close by or relatively far."
