abstract: "We evaluate an intervention taking place within vocational colleges in Israel, which establishes a framework with monitored deadlines and reminders for delivery of the proposal and submission of the final project required to graduate with a diploma. The goal is to study whether this way of adding structure and reducing uncertainty about the submission date can improve student performance, with particular focus on the completion of the requirements for a diploma. It will combine a randomized field experiment with collection of administrative and survey data on students in the vocational colleges. The research falls under the general headings of labor economics and economics of education, and also uses insights from behavioral economics. 

The fundamental reason for low educational outcomes among students who are already enrolled in educational programs is the exertion of too little effort (see e.g. Oreopoulus et al., 2019; Clark et al., 2020). Several different yet interrelated reasons were offered for this shortcoming. First, low effort may be a results of flawed time perception leading to an underestimation of the time required to complete a task (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979). Second, procrastination which is a type of self-control problem may lead students to end-up exerting less effort than initially intended, even if their time estimations were accurate. Procrastination is often the product of present bias, which is the human tendency to focus on the here-and-now and value immediate rewards over long-term benefits (O'Donoghue and Rabin, 1999). Bisin and Hyndman (2020) document that present bias is prevalent among college students. Third, time management was pointed out as challenging for students, which again relates to problems with the perception of time (Francis‐Smythe and Robertson,1999). Previous studies show that setting clear, well-organized deadlines can increase timely submission of projects (Ariely and Wertenbroch, 2002). When looking at long-term goals, it was shown that setting such goals and then listing the intermediate steps required to achieve them can improve academic performance (Morisano et al., 2010). Inspired by these findings, in this experiment we implemented deadlines for the “final project” proposal and submission, accompanied by text message reminders. 

Theoretically, diplomas and certificates are expected to decrease labor market frictions and alleviate adverse selection problems. Empirically, however, the causal effect of diplomas on labor market outcomes is difficult to identify, due to endogeneity problems (Gunderson and Oreopoulus, 2020). Provided that our intervention affects graduation rates and timing, a secondary aim of this project is to address the bigger question of the labor market returns to vocational education. Here, we plan to combine our data on students with administrative labor market data and utilize an Instrumental Variable approach to causally estimate the returns to vocational education.
