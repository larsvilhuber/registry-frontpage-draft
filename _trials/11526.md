abstract: "Weather uncertainty is a significant source of agricultural production risks, and is increasingly salient in the context of climate change. Short- to medium-range weather forecasts could help farmers optimize the timing of agricultural practices, increasing returns to agricultural investment. However, smallholder farmers in most parts of the developing world do not have access to highly localized, accurate forecasts, nor are forecasts customized to convey weather conditions relevant for agricultural decision-making. In this study, we investigate whether accurate, relevant-for-context, probabilistic, medium-range weather forecasts can aid farmer decision-making through a lab-in-the-field experiment. We will analyze whether climate change salience, probability training, prior luck impact choices in the experiment and willingness-to-pay for weather forecasts."
