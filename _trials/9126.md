abstract: "We quantify the extent to which Ukrainian refugees (with either Ukrainian and Russian ethnicity) caused by the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, face discrimination in access to the Czech labor market. Understanding the role of discrimination in access to the Czech labor market during a sudden and unprecedented inflow of refugees is especially important, due to Czechia’s lack of previous comparable immigration experience and due to public budget constraints. To deal with this new situation, the Czech government has adopted the so-called “Lex Ukraine” based on which Ukrainian refugees can start to work as soon as they enter Czechia, without additional bureaucratic burden for the prospective employer, as if they were permanent residents. To measure the differential treatment of refugees, we conduct a correspondence test. Using email addresses from a popular online repository of Czech firms, we send standard unsolicited job inquiries from female childless workers, for basic unskilled jobs (i.e., ISCO 8 and 9) in which language, other skills, and experience are irrelevant. In these inquiries, we randomly assign names to signal ethnicity and we disclose applicants’ status (i.e., citizen, refugee, or permanent resident) in various ways. In the analyses, we explore the static dimension of discrimination, that is, average attitudes during the period covered by the experiment, as well as the dynamic dimension of discrimination, that is, how attitudes vary during the experiment. To dig into the mechanisms, we leverage on two strategies. First, we compare Ukrainian refugees (with either Ukrainian and Russian ethnicity) to Ukrainian and Russian permanent residents. Second, we conduct a multi-wave survey of Czech firms that are inquired about their knowledge of the law, their intention to hire refugees, and their expectations about the downsides of hiring refugees.

While other countries have adopted a similar (set of) law(s) and thus a similar experiment could in theory be conducted, the Czech context is particularly suitable because of at least two reasons. First, this is a country with a Slavic language (i.e., Czech) which is the language family of Ukrainian and Russian. Thus, these languages are similar and language barriers are expected to be economically irrelevant, especially for low-skilled jobs. To put it into context, based on various language proximity indexes, Czech and Ukrainian/Russian are more similar than Italian and Spanish or Swedish and Norwegian; the difference between Czech and Ukrainian/Russian is just a bit larger than that between Czech and Slovak, which can be used almost interchangeably. Second, due to the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia in '68, there is a historical and lingering resentment toward Russians. Thus, we expect ethnic misidentification to be more likely to emerge than in other countries; as a consequence, Ukrainian-Russian refugees are more likely to be treated as if they were Russians. More details on this are discussed in the remainder of the document."
