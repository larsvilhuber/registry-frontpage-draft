abstract: "The purpose of this entry is to register a second group of hypotheses that we conduct as part of a split-sample approach, following Anderson and Magruder (2017). As outlined in the primary pre-analysis plan for this project (AEARCTR-0010435), we test several "main" hypotheses for this project. We also test "auxiliary" hypotheses by first screening the tests in an exploratory sample (35% of observations). The final step is to use the remaining 65% of data to confirm/reject the auxiliary hypotheses that passed the screening threshold (t=1.6) in the exploratory sample. In the attached pre-analysis plan, we list the hypotheses that passed the screening stage, and that we will test on the confirmation sample. "
