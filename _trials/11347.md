abstract: "This study wants to explore the competition and collaboration between humans and Large Language Models(e.g. ChatGPT), as well as humans' attitudes towards LLMs. We are planning to run a randomized control trial on social media platform. Four accounts will be operated simultaneously from scratch, with the copywriting for three of the accounts being generated separately by humans, LLMs, and human-AI collaboration. The copy for the other account will be randomly selected from those generated by LLMs or human-AI collaboration, but we will indicate at the beginning of the post that the copy was generated or co-generated by LLMs. Afterwards, we will allocate traffic to the four accounts and observe the views, likes, reposts and comments acquired by the accounts. We also plan to conduct a similiar survey experiment, where copies are presented for participants to rate without or with the labeling of the writer. The distinction of survey from Weibo is that attention is more abundant and individul-data is collected. We will examine (1) In the context of copywriting, who will gain more traffic and perform better: humans, LLMs, or human-AI collaboration?(2) Compared to copywriting produced by humans, will social media users have different attitudes towards copywriting generated or co-generated by LLMs? (3) For people who cooperate with LLMs to write copywriting, will they adopt more LLMs later in their work? What is the effect of LLMs adoption on performance?
