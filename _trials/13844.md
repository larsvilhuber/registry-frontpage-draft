abstract: "Previous research in Ghana has demonstrated the effectiveness of Differentiated Learning (teaching students at their level) on student learning. As a result, the Ghanaian Ministry of Education has decided to scale up differentiated learning to 10,000 schools in Ghana, an effort known as the Galop Initiative. Despite these efforts, the effective implementation of Differentiated Learning (DL) across the nation remains a challenge. Teaching in a differentiated manner demands additional effort, planning, and adaptability, making teacher motivation one potential barrier to implementation. Teacher motivation may be affected by their beliefs of whether or not students learn more effectively with differentiated learning compared to the status quo. The study seeks to assess whether providing information about the success of DL positively influences teacher motivation. Teachers from 200 schools are randomly selected to receive a information sheet highlighting the success of DL on math and reading outcomes, as well as testimonials from teachers on DL, while the remaining 200 schools serve as the Control Group.  By understanding the motivational factors, the research aims to identify mechanisms to inspire teachers to embrace and sustain the effort required for effective DL implementation."
