abstract: "There is a growing consensus in the economics literature that household decision-making is often characterized by inefficient use of resources. This suboptimal allocation of resources leads to “leaving money on the table” and is believed to arise from an inefficient bargaining process in which household members have different preferences and levels of bargaining power. In particular, in many developing countries where gender disparities are widespread, the preferences of women may not be given as much weight in household decisions. This project aims to understand the relationship between household efficiency, women’s bargaining power in the household, and nutrition outcomes for pregnant women and their newborns. We will recruit up to 1,200 pregnant women, participating in a partner study, and their spouses. We will use an economic experiment to measure bargaining power. We will access nutrition data from the partner study to assess how this revealed-preference measure of bargaining power varies with nutrition outcomes. We will also study whether a complex nutrition intervention delivered as part of a randomized controlled trial changes the relationship between bargaining power and nutrition outcomes. "
