abstract: "The primary purpose of the program being studied is to help at-risk students to graduate from high school. Program participants live in impoverished, dangerous communities and are most often attending low performing schools. The program aims to change the norm by giving them the necessary wraparound supports for students such as tutoring, youth advocacy, life skills training, job training, and college advising, so that they are able to overcome such adversity. While the program operates in several school districts across the country, this evaluation considers implementation of the program in two urban district in the northeast. These sites are best suited for evaluation due to the large number of students in the school districts, the high rate of childhood poverty, and the strong relationship between program administrators and the districts. Through a randomized controlled trial, comparing students eligible for the program but due to funding constraints, unserved students, with eligible students enrolled in the program, we are tracking key outcomes of the program, including academic progress, high school graduation, and postsecondary enrollment."
