abstract: "In this project, we analyze whether an interest exploration tool – combined with information about potential careers, paths to higher education and financing options – can provide guidance to students in rural Cambodia, help them to develop long-term career goals and thereby motivate them to continue in school. We target the intervention to adolescents in grade 9, who are about to decide whether to enroll in high school. We use survey data, as well as individual-level administrative data obtained from treatment and control schools to track educational decisions."
