abstract: "When communicating with the public, school systems often rely on measures of academic performance that poorly reflect schools’ contributions to student learning and which correspond closely to school demographics, potentially sustaining or exacerbating existing segregation. We seek to understand if the distribution of different kinds of academic performance information affects parents’ school preferences.

For nearly every public school in the US, the Stanford Education Data Archive (SEDA) provides estimates of average achievement status (student academic performance at one point in time) and average achievement growth (the rate of improvement in student academic performance over time). Average growth is not only a better measure of school effectiveness than average status, it also has a weaker relationship with school demographics. Using a nationally representative sample of 2,800 parents of children age 0-12, we will conduct an online survey experiment in which participants are asked to select their preferred schools from a series of options. All participants will receive demographic information for each school. In addition, some participants will be randomly assigned to receive status and/or growth information for each school. We hypothesize that parents who receive growth information--rather than status information or no academic performance information--will rely more heavily on this indicator and, as a result, prefer less white and less affluent schools."
