abstract: "Incentivizing the take-up of preventive health services can be effective to increase access in low-income countries. Yet even when care is incentivized, some individuals may not be sensitive to price because they still fail to see the benefits of using preventive services on their health. This may be particularly the case when individuals suffer from diseases whose symptoms are not salient, or when the hassle costs of setting up an appointment may outweigh its perceived benefits. Hence, policy-makers may be concerned that universal financial incentives for preventive services that fail to target the most at-risk individuals can generate wastage. In this study, we compare three ways of providing a preventive medical check-up for cardiovascular diseases (CVD): (i) free provision of the medical check-up (which includes a blood test and a consultation with a doctor); (ii) receiving a small payment for completing the check-up; (iii) receiving a very small, medium or large financial reward depending on whether the patient is diagnosed, at the check-up, to have respectively a small, medium or large risk of suffering from CVDs in the next 10 years. Comparing take-up of preventive care and behavior change at follow-up across these three groups allows us to test whether varying the level of the incentive by risk status is a cost-effective way to better screen and reach individuals the most at risk."
