abstract: "Forecast-based Financing (FbF) enables anticipatory actions for disaster mitigation at the community and government level using credible seasonal and weather forecasts. These forecasts are linked to predetermined contingency plans, actors, and funding instruments used to reduce the humanitarian caseload in the critical window between a forecast and an extreme weather event. The hypothesis is that an anticipatory approach can lead to a more effective and efficient response and help affected populations avoid negative coping strategies such as skipping meals, reducing portions, and eating lower-quality food (WFP, 2019). This study will employ a clustered randomized controlled trial (RCT) design to assess the impact of FbF in Nepal's two most vulnerable basins prone to floods (Karnali and Koshi, or a single basin depending on trigger activation). The key objective of this evaluation is to measure the causal effects of providing anticipatory cash assistance to flood-prone households (based on projections prior to an expected flood peak) on food security, coping, and livelihood outcomes, compared to a more "traditional" humanitarian response, which comes in the form of providing assistance after a flood peak has been confirmed."
