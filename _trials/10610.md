abstract: "The goal of this work is to understand whether small financial incentives and messaging can increase the take-up of COVID-19 boosters among patients empaneled at a county public health system. The motivation for this work is the relatively low take-up of COVID-19 boosters. In California, where our experiment is based, only 59% of the population has been boosted, with only 13% receiving the recommended bivalent booster (State of California, 2022)."
