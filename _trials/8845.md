abstract: "We investigate the role of moral consistency for social norms in domains of prosocial behavior by means of an online lab experiment. We elicit social norms on charitable giving and on carbon offsetting in hypothetical decision scenarios. We vary the number of past choices and whether past choices had been observed by others (within-subject). To analyse the role of consistency for social norms we also vary past choices (between-subject). To learn about the determinants of individual differences in norm perceptions, we measure individual preferences for consistency and personal norms. "
