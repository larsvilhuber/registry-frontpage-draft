abstract: "Skill development programs are sub-optimally effective because participants do not attend frequently enough, or because they drop out of the program before completion. Especially while learning skills with non-linear rewards to attendance, such as English language and soft skills, motivating students to attend more frequently, and to stick with the program till completion might yield significantly better outcomes. 

Drawing on the case of a one year English and non-cognitive skills development program in India, we analyze whether group incentives for attendance can be effective in increasing attendance and reducing dropout. To investigate this question, we divide the programâ€™s sessions (at the instructor level) into four treatment arms: (1) A treatment where students are combined into self-chosen two-person teams, with rewards for the team with the maximum joint attendance in a term, (2) A treatment where students are combined into exogenously chosen two-person teams, with rewards for the team with the maximum joint attendance in a term, (3) A treatment where students individually rewarded for maximum attendance in a term, and (4) A control group where no incentives are implemented. We anticipate that the team incentives (treatments 1 and 2) will increase attendance and decrease dropout compared to the individual rewards. We further analyze the impact of the incentives on the development of English and non-cognitive skills.
