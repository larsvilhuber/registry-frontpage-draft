abstract: "Using new cross-country survey and experimental data, we investigate the nature of beliefs about wage inequality and the effect of these beliefs on peopleâ€™s support for redistribution with over 9000 respondents across six high-income countries (Australia, France, Japan, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States). This study combines a flexible elicitation of beliefs about the distribution of full-time wages within each country and a randomized survey experiment where respondents are allocated into one of three groups, two of which receive different types of information about wage inequality.
