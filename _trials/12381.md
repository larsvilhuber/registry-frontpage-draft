abstract: "Economics and other STEM fields like Mathematics are dominated by men, but research finds that simple low cost informational interventions can impact interest in economics, and that higher-cost mentoring interventions–especially from women–have the potential to attract more women to these fields. By administering information and providing mentor opportunities to women at the early stages of their education, we can increase the number of women in these fields and lessen the gender gap. We propose a multi-step, multi-site, theory informed randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to increase the presence and success of women throughout the economics discipline while also measuring interest in Mathematics. First, we will administer an incentive-compatible pre-survey to high school and college students investigating what attributes attract women to Economics. This will inform the design of our RCT. Second, we will run a theoretically-informed RCT on college and high school students which randomizes informational interventions that highlight one of the pre-survey informed attributes that attract women to economics (e.g. mentoring). Our theoretical model predicts that by sending both high and low signals about a specific attribute, we can disentangle the effect of beliefs about this attribute versus other deterrents in pushing women away from Economics and Mathematics. Through our collaboration with the respective partners, we will measure self-reported interest in Economics and Mathematics for all of our sample, subsequent course enrollments/grades for those in our college sample as well as interest/completion of a college peer mentoring program. We will concentrate our analysis on measuring interest in courses, majors and minors in both Economics and Mathematics. Third, for those in our college sample who are interested in peer-mentoring, we randomize whether they receive mentoring from a male or female mentor in an important extension of Canaan and Mouganie (2021).
