abstract: "Research on basic education in developing countries has recently been shifting its focus from accessibility to schooling towards the quality of schooling. Inevitably, this will put the performance of teachers at the center of the debate. While recent data from African countries, India and El Salvador document alarmingly low levels of teacher content knowledge, we lack rigorous evidence as to how this problem may be tackled. This field experiment aims at providing novel insights on the effectiveness of two types of teacher training programs. Both evaluated interventions target primary school math teachers: The first intervention, labelled as "SITT" (School Based In-Service Teacher Training), is built around a five-days workshop and  detailed manuals that introduce new pedagogical techniques and offer an opportunity to refresh the participants' content knowledge. The second intervention, labelled as "SITT-D" (SITT-Digital), mixes computer-assisted self-learning (for teachers) and SITT. The design of the study allows to identify the causal effect of the implemented teacher training programs on the content knowledge of teachers and the math skills of their students. "
