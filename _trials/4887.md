abstract: "Pay as you go (PAYGo) solar home systems are a market-based technology to increase rural electrification for low income households. However, the setting in which consumers use the PAYGo contract may feature market frictions that push consumers away from their optimal demand for electricity. I partner with a solar company in Rwanda to experimentally reduce relevant market frictions. I use this experiment to better understand non-price determinants of demand for electricity among rural, low income consumers."
