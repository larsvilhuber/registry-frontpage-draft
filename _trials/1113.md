abstract: "Studies in K-12 and higher education document that women and racial minority students perform better when paired with an instructor of the same gender or race (Dee, 2005; Carrell et al. 2010; Fairlie et al. 2014). These studies attribute the differences in outcomes to both active effects (e.g., changing teaching style to match student needs) and passive effects (e.g., studentsâ€™ differential allocation of attention due to instructor race or gender). We are unaware of any studies that are able to distinguish between these active and passive effects. We conduct an experiment to identify the effect of perceived gender and race on student performance that isolates the impact of passive teacher effects in the context of online education."
