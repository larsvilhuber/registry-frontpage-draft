abstract: "Inequality has long been a pervasive issue within societies worldwide, perpetuating disparities in wealth, opportunity, and access to resources. Despite advancements in various domains, the persistence of inequality remains a significant concern. Central to this discourse is the notion of redistribution -- an approach aimed at rectifying disparities by reallocating resources, opportunities, or privileges among members of a society. The effectiveness of such measures often depends on the support and willingness of individuals within the community to endorse and advocate for re-distributive policies. However, understanding the factors that influence individuals' preferences for redistribution remains an ongoing area of inquiry. One compelling feature for exploring the dynamics of preferences for redistribution lies in the idea of raising awareness about inequality. Our study underlies on the idea that increasing awareness about the extent and consequences of inequality might significantly impact individuals' attitudes and preferences towards re-distributive policies. This assumption is grounded in the belief that a deeper understanding of the injustices and ramifications of inequality could potentially stimulate greater support for measures aimed at rectifying these disparities. Hence, this research aims to investigate the relationship between raising awareness about inequality and its subsequent influence on individuals' preferences for redistribution. Through an experimental setup employing a -controlled intervention-simulated video -- this study aims to investigate the causal link between created awareness of inequality and the inclination towards endorsing altruism and re-distribute behavior. The insights from this study may offer valuable guidance in shaping inclusive and equitable policies that align with the sentiments and aspirations of diverse societal segments. Our research motivation underscores the importance of exploring how raising awareness about inequality may serve as a catalyst in influencing individuals' support for redistribution, thereby offering a nuanced understanding crucial for fostering a fairer and more equal society. 
To achieve our research objectives, we developed a comprehensive methodology combining a survey framework with an experimental intervention designed to manipulate information perception through a targeted video presentation on inequality.
