abstract: "Despite being often discussed both in practice and academic circles, the sunk cost effect remains empirically elusive. We develop an experimental paradigm that overcomes the deficiencies of the previous research in identifying the effect. Additionally, motivated by a model based on reference point dependence, we formulate a novel prediction that if the intervention places individuals on the same side of the reference point (for example, both in the gain region), the sunk cost effect does not manifest itself. In an online study, we randomize the price of a ticket to enter a game where the payoff depends on performance, and observe its effect on playtime. The price (low, medium, or high) is realized after the purchase of the ticket. The distribution is fully disclosed prior to the event, with the low and high prices placing the participant on the opposite sides of the reference point."
