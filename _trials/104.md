abstract: "This is an evaluation of the Numeric after-school maths program for Grade 8 students from low-income areas around Cape Town, South Africa.  The program, which takes place in school computer labs, uses the free online learning platform called Khan Academy.  Globally, Khan Academy is a high-profile education tool, having delivered over 260 million video lessons as of August 2013.  Numeric’s added value is the creation of an offline video browser which allows the organization to stream high quality video in a low (or no) bandwidth environment.
 
The evaluation is designed to test the ability of a computer-based intervention that uses large amounts of refined content (in the form of video lessons) and data-driven feedback to improve students’ maths performance.  The evaluation takes place in a country that performs at or near the bottom of 8th grade math performance in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) despite a relatively high level of public sector expenditure on education.  If successful, the intention is for Numeric to increase the scale of its after-school programs.

The evaluation will use creative maths testing procedures to overcome the oft-cited problem in education research of low-stakes assessment tests actually measuring motivation rather than ability.  The evaluation will also seek to identify the channels through which the program improves maths performance, thereby equipping education policymakers with valuable information on how to structure similar interventions.  Finally, the evaluation will measure impacts on non-math outcomes, including a measure of nonverbal cognitive ability and computer literacy.
 
The evaluation team aims to register this trial prior to endline data collection, cleaning, and analysis."
