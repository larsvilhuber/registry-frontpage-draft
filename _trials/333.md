abstract: "The Community-Based Health and Nutrition to Reduce Stunting Project, or the Nutrition Project, is part of the Millennium Challenge Corporationâ€™s $600 million Compact with the Government of Indonesia, and seeks to improve a range of maternal and child health outcomes, particularly stunting, with the ultimate goal of reducing poverty. Demand and supply side activities include a community-level conditional cash transfer program,  training for village-level health care workers, promoting improved sanitation and hygiene, providing micronutrients, providing length-taking equipment, and a national awareness campaign targeted at improving the determinants of stunting. Mathematica is conducting the impact evaluation of the Nutrition Project in three provinces, Central Kalimantan, West Kalimantan and South Sumatra, utilizing a randomized control trial design. The evaluation focuses primarily on impacts related to measures such as sanitation, hygiene, nutrition and breastfeeding practices, utilization of health services, and maternal and child health outcomes, such as stunting, birth weight, and anemia.
