abstract: "Providing skills training and promoting job matching and entrepreneurship are dominant active labor market policies pursued by governments around the world. While programmatic evaluations have been built into a large number of nationally implemented skills programs, systematically designed rigorous evaluations are limited, particularly in the context of urban wage labor markets in developing countries.  In this study, we evaluate the impact of a model that focusses on soft skills training that are particularly relevant for job search processes as well as succeeding in the workplace. The training combines self-paced online and instructor-led in-person learning focused on professional skill development. The target population are urban university students and fresh graduates, aged between 20 and 30 in Bangladesh. The outcomes of interest will primarily be labor market behaviors and outcomes that include an preparedness assessment (e.g. job search behavior and intensity, CV composition, interviewing ability etc), as well as employment status, income/wage, job retention and  job satisfaction.  ."
