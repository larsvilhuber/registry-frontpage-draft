abstract: "This study explores how fluctuations in income affect economic decisions. Lower social program participation rates and lower rates of health-improving behaviors have been documented among the poor than among the non-poor. In this study, I examine whether poverty-related stress explains these empirical findings. In particular, I examine whether positive fluctuations in income increase consistency of decision-making, healthy behaviors, and uptake of a welfare-improving opportunity. I differentiate between expected and unexpected increases in income and examine a cognitive mechanism.  "
