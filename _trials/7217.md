abstract: "Estimating individual distributional preferences has become a widely used technique in behavioural economics research. A frequently utilised methodology to do so has been put forward by Fisman, Kariv and Markovits (2007). In their methodology, subjects make distributional choices in 50 modified dictator games, which are then used to estimate two distinct utility parameters. One captures the relative weight for the own payoff (α) and the other describes an efficiency-equity trade off (ρ). In this study, we use the original and new data to explore whether we can reduce the number of distributional choices made by subjects whilst still accurately estimating preference parameters. Simulation results, already obtained by us, show high accuracy in estimating both parameters when using as few as 20 dictator games. In order to experimentally confirm our simulations, we collected a first wave (Wave 1) of data, indicating good performance of our proposed methodology. However, we are going to extend the analysis with additional data to explore some aspects of the results based on Wave 1 data."
