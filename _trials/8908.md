abstract: "Women and students from minority groups are severely under-represented in the field of economics. Previous studies have documented that under-represented university students are less likely to feel like they “belong” in their field and they tend to score lower in measures of growth mindset (e.g., Bayer et al. 2020 AEA P&P). This might contribute to differences in course performance, majoring choices and graduation rates. In this project, we implement a field experiment to investigate whether weekly encouraging emails sent out by the Department of Economics, and centered around the message “You belong here and you can do this,” have a significant impact on the college experience – broadly defined – of economics majors, and in particular of women and under-represented minority students. Additionally, we test whether including in the emails profiles of a diverse set of young alumni (peer role models), and an additional encouraging message from the alumni, has a significant impact on students.
