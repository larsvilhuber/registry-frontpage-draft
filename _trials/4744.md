abstract: "The goal of this study is to examine the effects of performance target on business idea generation and selection performances within entrepreneurial teams. We plan to embed a field experiment in a one-day hackathon by randomly assigning entrepreneurial teams into either a treatment (high financial target in terms of profitability) or a control (low financial target in terms of profitability) conditions.
