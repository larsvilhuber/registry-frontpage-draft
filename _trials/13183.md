abstract: "This project aims to improve applicants’ experiences with reporting their income on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) application. The SNAP application requires applicants to provide information about their income in the past 30 days to assess eligibility and calculate benefits amounts. Additionally, applicants have to upload verification documents that confirm their responses on the application. This project uses an application digital assister, designed by Code For America (CfA), to help individuals in a large U.S. state complete the SNAP application. This evaluation examines which of three different sets of options for reporting income are more effective at encouraging applicants to complete the SNAP application. In the federal context, multiple benefits applications ask applicants to report their income, and administrative burdens in form completion can impede access to federal programs among eligible beneficiaries. This project also will build generalizable evidence regarding how to ask people about income that can be applied across forms, benefits applications, and surveys administered by the federal government that include modules on income reporting."
