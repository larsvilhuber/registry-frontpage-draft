abstract: "In this study we systematically test for discrimination in the UK rental mark in an experimental setting. Contrary to previous experimental studies, we designed a randomized controlled trial closer to real interactions between prospective tenants and rental agents. In this experiment we made inquiries by phone, where we allocated callers with different foreign accents randomly across standardized one-bedroom properties. "
