abstract: "This study aims to replicate and extend some key results from AEARCTR-0012706, a survey that elicits consumer preferences over inflation. The survey embeds an RCT, featuring one information treatment and one control group, in addition to treatments that vary response modes and demand effects. The survey also includes a task that confronts respondents with a trade-off between stabilizing inflation and unemployment, followed by measures of various economic preference parameters."
