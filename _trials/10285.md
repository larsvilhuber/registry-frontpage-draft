abstract: "Many parts of the world have been experiencing poor quality water, which has not been sufficient, especially at the domestic level where water usage keeps on increasing over time. It is expected that the demand for water will be greater than the supply by 40% as a result of a fast-growing population and poor water management. Tanzania is among the developing countries that have been facing water scarcity for households living in urban areas and for those that have access to it, its availability is unreliable, irregular, and highly erratic, and as a result, households do not consider water from authorities as the main source. This scarcity of water and its unreliability calls for the need to conserve water as an important natural resource. Therefore, this study proposes to use randomized control trials to investigate whether the provision of information on water usage can influence urban domestic households water saving behavior. This study will disseminate knowledge to local authorities and the public about the importance of being accountable in the use and management of water resources in line with the Tanzaniaâ€™s development vision of 2025 on effective utilization and management of natural resources. This will guide policy decisions that aim at promoting efficient use of water. The paper will use baseline data from the government water authority and survey data which will be collected in Dar es Salaam city, Tanzania. A sample size of 900 urban households will be surveyed while during an intervention, 1600 households will be used.
