abstract: "Can social signaling incentivize caregivers to immunize their children? Working with the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MoHS) Sierra Leone, I introduce a social incentive in the form of differently colored bracelets that children receive upon coming for immunization visits. The differently colored bracelets make highly salient if the immunization schedule is unfinished and if other children have received immunizations that your child has missed. Different to most incentives that are material or private in nature (e.g. food, cash transfers) the bracelets make the decision to immunize your child observable and allow caregivers to signal to others that they look after their child's health. I implement a field experiment in government clinics to test the effects of the social incentive on timely and complete immunization. I further measure the effect of the bracelets on individuals' knowledge and beliefs about others' immunization choices. I vary the visibility of immunization decisions across treatment arms by implementing different variations of the bracelet scheme. This experimental design allows me to separately identify the extent to which behavior change is driven by (i) the demand for bracelets or reminder effects, (ii) learning from others or (iii) the desire to signal to others.
