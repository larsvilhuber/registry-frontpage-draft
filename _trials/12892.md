abstract: "We study the effectiveness of the central bank message delivery on households' inflation, wage growth and interest rate expectations. We provide random subsets of participants in the Nielsen Homescan panel with video, one chart from the monetary policy report press conference. We ask their CPI inflation, wage growth, interest rate expectations before and after the treatment. This experiment allows us to assess to what extent these verbal and nonverbal communications in the different formats of communication alter the beliefs of households."
