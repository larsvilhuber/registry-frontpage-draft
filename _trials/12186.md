abstract: "Sports clubs play a huge role for social integration and physical fitness for children in many countries. However, several groups are underrepresented in these clubs. Permanently increasing sports club participation has been proven to be difficult.

In this paper, we examine the results from a natural field experiment. We provide elementary school pupils in Rogaland, Norway, with information leaflets about sports clubs in their vicinity. These leaflets contain information about sport type, name and contact of the club, club address, and club webpage. The main information is available in Norwegian, English, Russian, and Arabic. 

After two months, we observe if this intervention increased the number of children joining a sports club. The findings are relevant for governing institutions and policy-makers as the setting makes it possible to scale the experiment up. Researchers studying social integration may find the novel method used here of considerable interest.
