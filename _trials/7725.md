abstract: "This study examines the role of community volunteers in providing coaching, mentoring and overall support for beneficiaries of the Nigeria National Social Safety Nets Program Livelihood Pilot. Selected beneficiaries receive a cash grant to commence (or expand existing) productive activities. In addition, they receive training in business skills, life skills as well as coaching and mentoring (which consists of group sessions and individual visits). The training is provided by Cash Transfer Facilitators (CTF), government employees assigned to serve a range of communities. In randomly selected treatment communities, community volunteers (CVs) are selected and trained to provide the individual visits coaching and mentoring component (in place of the CTF). CVs differ from CTFs in that they are members of the community and so have greater proximity to beneficiaries. However, they are usually less educated and less connected to government and other outside networks. The objective is to assess the effectiveness of CVs in serving in this role to understand the best way of delivering a complex program as this. "
