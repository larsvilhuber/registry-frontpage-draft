abstract: "Globally, around 80% of adolescents do not meet the World Health Organization’s recommended activity level (World Health Organization 2019). Physical activity is essential not only for health outcomes, but may also be important for academic outcomes, as it may improve academic behavior and performance  and facilitate learning through improved cognition and emotional wellbeing. It is thus expected that students would benefit from increasing their activity level.
Active travel is a form of physical activity that is assumed easily incorporated into people’s everyday lives. Active travel results in more physical activity during the school commute than the inactive counterparts. Despite the benefits of active travel, international research shows a decrease in the number of children using an active form of transport to school. 
Gamification has shown promising results in the health and physical activity domain, however, the literature on using gamification to study active transport is limited, particularly among adolescents. 
In this study we want to investigate the following research question: To what extent does gamification impact active travel (cycling or walking) among adolescent.
