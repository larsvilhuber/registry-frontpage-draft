abstract: "This project investigates the effects of a learning recovery program from COVID-19 for students in Samut Sakhon, Thailand using randomized controlled trial. The intervention is an online curriculum for teachers, students and parents designed by Starfish Country Home School Foundation. 
Sixty schools will be randomly assigned to control and treatment by matched pair design making 30 schools in each group. 
Schools in the treatment group will receive the learning recovery program while schools in the control group will not. The program will last for 2 semesters (or 1 academic year). The evaluation team will collect a baseline survey around the beginning of the first semester and an endline survey around the end of second semester.
Primary outcomes are post-intervention students' cognitive skills measure by standardized test scores in math, English and Thai; socio-emotional skills measured by Behavior Problems Index (NLSY79 Child) and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Secondary outcomes are IRT scores, binary outcomes indicating whether post-intervention score has passed the baseline median score for each subject, classroom quality and program adoption.
