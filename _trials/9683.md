abstract: "This trial is an update of Cagala, Tobias, Ulrich Glogowsky and Johannes Rincke. 2020. "Content Matters: The Effects of Commitment Requests on Truth-Telling", https://doi.org/10.1257/rct.6700. We plan to collect additional data on the cheating game in a laboratory experiment and an online survey on psychological reactance. 

The main changes relative to the cited trial are as follows: First, compared to the last run, the experimental data will be collected in the laboratory rather than online. This step allows us to test the robustness of our results across settings. Second, we will collect data in two laboratories (Munich and Konstanz). To facilitate data collection, we extended our team of principal investigators (Simeon Schudy has joined the team as a new PI). Third, we will reduce the number of treatments to maximize the statistical power. Specifically, we will implement the control group, the ethics treatment, and the sanction treatment (but not the neutral treatment). Fourth, we decided to change the ordering of the reactance survey and the experiment: The experimental data will be collected first, followed by the online survey on reactance. Hereby, we avoid any spillovers of the survey questions on behavior in the experiment.
