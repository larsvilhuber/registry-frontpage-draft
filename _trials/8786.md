abstract: "Information frictions on the knowledge of oneâ€™s impact can stymie civil servant motivation for the well-being of individuals they serve. We conduct a field experiment among public school teachers in Pakistan. We randomize teachers to receive one of three information treatments. One treatment arm is growth mindset training that student outcomes are elastic and malleable. A second treatment arm presents a narrative about teacher value-added. A third treatment arm presents empirical evidence on teacher value-added. We cross-randomize teachers to receive additional SMS messages to reinforce the training."
