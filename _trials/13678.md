abstract: "This study aims to investigate how Germans perceive the modal split in their cities, whether they can accurately estimate it, specifically the proportion of travel by car, and whether their perception of modal split influences attitudes about public spending on transportation infrastructure. I conduct an information treatment experiment on 4,500 participants within a larger survey on transportation policies and behavior. There are two distinct groups in the survey sample, which receive slightly different experimental designs but with the same overarching hypotheses."
