abstract: "Overall student learning levels remain extremely low across East Africa, despite a decade plus of major reforms and significant new investments in public education. In Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, recent nationwide surveys show that large majorities of children are unable to read or do arithmetic at the required level (Uwezo at Twaweza, 2011). While the challenges facing the education sector are well known, existing reforms and aid instruments have largely failed to improve the situation.

At present, the two main approaches used by governments to improve the quality of education in East Africa are to strengthen teacher training and to disburse a capitation grant for books and related activities to schools. On the former, several studies show formal levels of teacher qualification to be weakly correlated to performance. On the latter, it is difficult to establish the impact of capitation grants on improving learning outcomes because the full amounts of the grant have not consistently reached schools and because they have not been rigorously evaluated. At the same time, even if funds were to flow well, under current arrangements no one is held accountable or incentivized to achieve learning. The lack of adequate attention to accountability and incentives may in part explain why increased budgets for education have not resulted in improved learning outcomes. So while government programs have largely focused on providing educational inputs, recent evidence suggests that it may be more effective to incentivize the delivery of learning outcomes, particularly at the local level (see Glewwe and Kremer 2005, and Kremer and Holla 2009).

In short, we see three key challenges to improving education in East Africa: (1) how to consistently get resources to the lowest (school/community) levels, (2) how to effectively invest (government and donor) resources by gearing the education process to emphasize learning outcomes rather than educational inputs, and (3) how to generate rigorous evidence of what works and have it inform national education debate, policy and practice. 

In this project we seek to evaluate the impact of two separate approaches to improving early grade learning outcomes. We seek to evaluate the impact of providing schools with extra resources in the form of capitation grants (a grant per child enrolled) and the impact of providing teachers with incentives to achieve foundational learning outcomes in early grades (teachers receive a small bonus for each student that achieves an appropriate learning outcome). In addition we will evaluate the combination of the two approaches (i.e. capitation grants and teacher incentives).

The evaluation is being implemented in 350 government primary schools in 10 districts in Tanzania between 2013 and 2014.
