abstract: "We investigate the impact of competition on the susceptibility to moral transgressions. We use contests to model competition and consider lying as a prominent form of moral transgression. Contests are likely to influence the frequency of moral transgressions for two reasons: First, the expected monetary benefit from lying may differ between settings with and without competition. Second, contests may reduce moral concerns by triggering a “desire to win”. We design treatments where the expected financial benefit from lying is the same in treatments with and without a contest structure. This allows us to isolate the pure behavioral impact of competing against others. Overall, our study consists of four treatments. We design three treatments with identical financial benefits from lying. In all three treatments, we employ the die-under-the-cup paradigm introduced by Fischbacher & Föllmi-Heusi (2013) where subjects roll a die in private and then report the outcome. We vary the external consequences of lying and the competition with others across treatments. In the fourth treatment, we elicit treatment-specific social norms by following the methodology developed in Krupka and Weber (2013). All treatments will be executed on a large online platform (Prolific). "
