abstract: "In this work, we are partnering with Contra Costa Health Services (CCHS), the department of health in Contra Costa County, CA, to measure  COVID-19 vaccinations and other COVID-19 related preventive health behaviors in the countyâ€™s Medicaid managed care population. Our work will test ways to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake. We hypothesize that small financial incentives and other low-cost behavioral nudges can be used to increase vaccine uptake and reduce disparities in uptake among diverse racial/ethnic minority populations.
