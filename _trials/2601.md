abstract: "Previous studies show that peer observation affects productivity (Falk and Ichino, 2006; Mas and Moretti, 2009; Georganas, Tonin, and Vlassopoulos, 2015), especially when people face temptation (Bonein and Denant-Boèmont, 2015). The focus of the proposed study is to determine how people’s decisions to engage in a tempting behavior and expend effort in a tedious task are affected by pre-commitment and the presence of peers. The proposed study is built on a study about the effect of peer pressure on self-control (Bonein and Denant-Boèmont, 2015), in which peer pressure was manipulated by revealing people’s past behaviors in a real effort task under temptation to their partners in a bargaining game. Their result suggested that peer pressure does not affect people’s decisions toward temptation. However, the authors only used indirect peer pressure, meaning that one partner could not observe their partner’s work; they could only see whether they did above their pre commitment or below it. 
To make peer pressure more natural, we suggest that the participants should complete the task in the presence of their peer. We believe that people will be more productive in the presence of another worker. We will also manipulate the payoff schema for participants in the pair treatment. Participants in one group share earnings with their teammate, while participants in the other group are paid based on their individual behavior. We expect that participants in the pair treatment, those sharing profits with their teammates, will be the most productive and earn the most among three treatments."
