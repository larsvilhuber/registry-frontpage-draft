abstract: "Digital technologies enhance business practices in many ways, including allowing connections and therefore sales to be made with customers through their websites. However, they also incur an environmental cost through significant energy consumption. Promoting efficient use of technologies and design practices in website creation can mitigate these impacts. Additionally, signalling of sustainable practices might also be used to attract and retain customers concerned about the environmental implications of digital technologies. This field experiment will contain two parts. In the first RCT, we will seek to understand how different messages motivate firms to take actions that reduce the environmental impact of their websites and to engage with resources/training detailing these actions. The second trial will seek to understand whether the opportunity to signal participation publicly in a challenge to reduce website environmental effects impacts firmsâ€™ improvement efforts, in addition to an evaluation of the overall efficacy of the online toolkit intervention.
