abstract: "In this online survey experiment (1000 respondents in the Brussels Region, from 7/11/2022-5/12/2022) we test the prediction that crisis awareness and concern has an effect on institutional and social trust. We proxy crisis awareness and concern using priming treatment questions related to the ongoing energy crisis. We expect crisis awareness to reduce trust levels across the board. We furthermore expect respondents that are more concerned about the crisis to report lower levels of social trust than institutional trust, and vice versa. The experiment is preceded by a general survey on institutional reform in Brussel, which operationalises the context we are interested in. We have two outcome questions eliciting social and institutional trust, and one behavioural outcome measuring the willingness to participate in citizen panels discussing reform in Brussels, as a proxy for trust. Whether the latter willingness is eventually translated into actual participation, can also be elicited."
