abstract: "Does the provision of information on outcomes of local governments improve political accountability? In this project we study, first, whether the provision of information on the performance of local public schools by incumbent politicians affects political outcomes (i.e. turnout and vote for the incumbent) and, second, whether there are heterogeneous by different ways of providing information, i. e. with different benchmarks.

We test this in the context of Chile, where (i) the provision of public education depends on locally elected governments and (ii) there are reliable data on educational outcomes. The experiment consists in sending an information letter to voters in randomly selected voting booths one week before local elections, to be held in October 23, 2016. The letters contain information on past performance of incumbent mayors on education (correcting for differences in socioeconomic status and resources across different municipalities), in both levels and changes. Furthermore, we will also assess the effects of two different yardsticks: in one group of letters we stress the average educational performance of municipalities and in the other, the performance of the top municipality. With this, we expect to provide insights on how citizens assess information when they have different benchmarks at hand, and on how they trade-off information on performance in levels and changes."
