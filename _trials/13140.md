abstract: "School Ready Music Programme (SRMP)
This project aims to harness the neuroscience informed benefits of daily music and movement activities in the EYFS (Early Years Foundation Stage) including school readiness skills, pre-phonics skills, group skills, 12 areas of the baseline assessment. It also aims to assess the impact on knowledge, confidence and wellbeing of educators and parents taking part. The music and movement activities of the SRMP) have been developed over 15 years with most recent evaluation of the SRMP at four schools in Merton, South London (Boogie Mites, 2024).
The SRMP includes a Boogie Mites Teacher led:
•	preparatory teacher training workshop for the EYFS team 
•	six- week onsite course with pre-school children 
•	three-week course with targeted Year R children 
•	three-week course with targeted parents and children. 
The music activities are embedded in daily activities in the pre-school year, in small group sessions once or twice a week with target children in Year R, and parents are encouraged to practice at home with their children. Teachers and parents are supported by access to digital resources.
We will implement SRMP in 10 schools in areas of disadvantage in England. If the benefits indicated by neuroscience evidence and evaluation to date are harnessed, we will see improved school ready skills for children, educators and parents enjoying using music activities confidently.
This matters because we have a significant number of children from disadvantaged areas starting school without foundations for learning in place, teachers are facing burnout and parents needing support with home learning activities.
