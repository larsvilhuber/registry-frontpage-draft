abstract: "Expansion of e-commerce presents new opportunities for SMEs to enter broader markets at lower costs, but the new entrants face barriers to growth after entry. To facilitate the new entrants to overcome these barriers, we implement a training program as a randomized controlled experiment with new sellers on a large e-commerce platform. The business training program focuses on delivering practical knowledge of business operation skills and seeks to tackle challenges specific to the new sellers.  We plan to analyze the impacts of the training on sellers and consumers on the platform with the administrative data. "
