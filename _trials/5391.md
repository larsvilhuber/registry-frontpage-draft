abstract: "How should performance feedback be tailored to improve worker productivity? In a natural field experiment with 409 bus drivers and over 500,000 trip-level observations, we test the potential of two forms of individual feedback on improving worker productivity: written peer-comparison feedback and in-person coaching.

We find that a) the announcement of the written feedback program has a substantial and significant effect on fuel economy and outcomes pertaining to passenger comfort; b) targeted peer-comparison feedback is generally ineffective; c) in-person coaching generates significant improvements on all dimensions for drivers in the bottom half of the performance distribution. These effects last for about eight weeks; d) in-person coaching reduces the impact of written peer-comparison feedback but not vice versa."
