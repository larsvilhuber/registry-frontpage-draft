abstract: "Qualified teachers are a fundamental input for any education system. This paper presents the results of a large-scale intervention to attract high performing high-school students into the teaching profession in Chile. The intervention was a five-arm campaign delivered through social media (Instagram/Facebook, Google Search, Youtube), which made salient three types of motivations: intrinsic/altruistic, extrinsic, and prestige-related. In addition, we sent specific messages to two groups of students based on their career interest (STEM or non STEM) in order to persuade them to follow a related pedagogy.  The messages were designed by an NGO focused on promoting teaching careers and were delivered during 4 weeks right before students' application to higher education. We measure two types of outcomes: application to majors in education and enrollment to those types of majors."
