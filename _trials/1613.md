abstract: "Recent research suggests that more frequent meeting can increase social capital among microfinance clients. Using random assignment of first-time borrowers to either weekly or monthly repayment groups as well as a later public goods experiment, the researchers demonstrate that borrowers assigned to weekly repayment groups interact more often and exhibit a higher willingness to pool risk with group members from their Ô¨Årst loan cycle nearly two years after the experiment. They were also three times less likely to default on their loan.  In a second intervention, the researchers find that social capital gains associated with more frequent meeting accrue across multiple lending cycles for new and existing borrowers, but the effects are heterogeneous.
