abstract: "Building on Hajdini et al (2022), we study how inflation expectations and income growth expectations are related using exogenous variation in inflation expectations. We exploit evidence for a panel of countries to understand how institutional and historical context affect the degree of passthrough from inflation expectations to income growth expectations. "
