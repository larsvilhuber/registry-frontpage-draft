abstract: "This study examines the effect of food vouchers on adolescent girlsâ€™ nutrition behaviors and preferences in Indonesia. Nutrition during adolescence is increasingly recognized as a key to a healthy and productive life of women and their children. We will run our experiment in 5 high schools in Indonesia. A total of 1000 adolescent girls aged 12-16 will be randomized into receiving either non-food vouchers or two different food vouchers. Vouchers are personalized and will be handed out over a three week period (2 times a week). The food vouchers can be redeemed at food stalls on school grounds. We will test for the impacts of our treatments on healthy choices in two follow-up controlled meal choices and self-reported food consumption.
