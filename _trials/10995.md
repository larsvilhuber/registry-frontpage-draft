abstract: "In Mali, rural agricultural input markets are largely missing, leading to productivity and welfare losses. Ag-dealers are constrained in opening new input markets as transportation costs and demand uncertainty are both high. Furthermore, liquidity in rural markets is low as banks face high loan costs per client.

This project will evaluate the Village Input Fairs (VIF) model as it scales. The VIF provides a solution to creating agricultural input markets by easing multiple constraints on the demand and supply sides. On the demand side, farmers use early commitment contracts to order inputs in the post-harvest period for delivery in the planting season and have access to credit. On the supply side, ag-dealers select VIFs to supply which are coordinated by private VIF enterprises. Private VIF enterprises are the market-makers, providing ag-dealers access to VIF markets, coordinating with microfinance partners, and generating revenue from the license sales to cover their costs.  

This research will answer questions about the effectiveness of private sector scaling strategies on input demand and supply side constraints of ag-dealers.
