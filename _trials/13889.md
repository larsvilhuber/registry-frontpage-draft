abstract: "Existing evidence from developed countries shows the effectiveness of community schools and counseling programs on school retention, thanks to their ability to provide crucial social support and valuable information. Yet, evidence for developing countries remains limited and the key mechanisms driving the success of these programs remain to be disentangled. To answer these questions, the GUARDIAN project will examine two types of interventions in Quiché, Guatemala, through a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The RCT will assess the impact of a school-based mentoring and information program and compare it with the impact of an information-only campaign. By comparing the outcomes of the combined program and the information-only campaign, the project aims to identify the relative importance of social support versus informational content in reducing school dropout rates in a low-income setting.
