abstract: "PRO-Jeunes is a 5-year program (2017- 2021) implemented by the International Rescue Committee (IRC) that targets 10,000 vulnerable young people (60% of female) aged 15-24 in rural and urban Cote d’Ivoire (Abidjan, Bassam, Korogho and Tchologo). The project is designed to offer (self-) employment support services that are particularly flexible to meet a wide range of beneficiaries’ needs, and that adapt to their different starting points and knowledge levels.
The research project proposes to examine the extent to which (i) access to information on the perceived returns to skills training affect the take-up of a training program targeting urban youth and (ii) different socio-emotional skills and, aspirations in a traditional gender norms setting  affect primary outcomes of youth employment and entrepreneurship and secondary outcomes of exposure to violence and reproductive health. It will be answered through a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) that targets young people aged 15-24 years eligible and interested in participating in the Pro-Jeunes project in Abidjan and Bassam. To examine the role of these factors, the study will specifically test: (i) the provision of information about the project advantages to eligible program participants; (ii) two socio-emotional skills trainings delivered to program participants; and (iii) screenings of videos with the aim of increasing entrepreneurial aspirations. 
A key innovation of this study is to test two different socio-emotional trainings targeting different sets of skills, in interaction (or not) with a video-based intervention aiming to increase entrepreneurial aspirations by providing exposure to role models (successful young men and women) through digital learning- video available on the Pro-Jeunes digital platform.
