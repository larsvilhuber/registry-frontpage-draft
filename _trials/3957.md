abstract: "We evaluate a large-scale randomized educational intervention that aims to cultivate and stimulate curiosity in the classroom environment. The study is motivated by the evidence on the importance of curiosity as a fundamental driver of academic achievement. The intervention involves intensive teacher training, which has two components: 
1.	Curricular component: An interdisciplinary team of teachers, education consultants and pedagogy specialists designed a curriculum to be delivered by studentsâ€™ own trained teachers. The curriculum contains visual and reading materials that emphasize the importance of having an inquisitive and open mind and the benefits of asking questions. 

2.	Pedagogical Component: Teachers receive various pedagogical (and practical) tips to practice inquiry-based learning and to create an inquisitive classroom culture. 
Teachers are given 5 months to implement the proposed pedagogy supported by the activities prescribed in the curriculum. The trial involves 77 schools in the province of Mersin, Turkey, and targets the 4th and 5th-grade students.
The intervention will be evaluated with respect to experimental as well as achievement outcomes.
