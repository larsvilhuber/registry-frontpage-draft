abstract: "Belot et al (2021) lay out a theory of discount factor measurement aimed to deal with changes in income and associated background consumption over time. In many existing methods, experimental payments are assumed to be added to a “background consumption” to generate a stream of consumption, and constant background consumption is required for discount factor elicitation. Consider two individuals who have identical discount factor and identical late background consumption, but the first individuals has the same background consumption also in the early period while the second individual has less background consumption in the early period. If confronted with choices about having money early or late, the second individual has a higher marginal valuation of money early and is therefore more likely to choose the earlier payment for that reason. 

Belot et al (2021) lay out a method based on choices about high-stakes lottery tickets. Applying the economic model that underlies their method to the scenario outlined in the previous paragraph shows that both individuals should be equally eager to choose the early lottery. Choices should directly reflect time preferences, rather than changes in background consumption.

This validation experiment aims to test this by triggering changes in perceived background consumption through detailed questions about near-term expenditures for some of the participants. This is intended to make them realize that their expenditures are higher than expected in the near-term, and therefore they feel that they have to reduce near-term background consumption. If they feel poor in the near-term relative to similar individuals who have not been treated, this should effect measured discount factors in the convex budget set method. Under the multiple lottery list method of Belot et al (2021), this should not happen. We intend to test this."
