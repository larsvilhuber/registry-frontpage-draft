abstract: "The trial constitutes the second part of my PhD Thesis research. The thesis tries to verify wether Cultivation Theory, a classical theoretical framework for the analysis of television effects on audience, may be considered a valid approach for the analysis of videogame's effects on player beliefs. The study is relevent both for the worlds of Games Studies and Human-Machine Interaction in which the effect of interactive media on the audience have always been a heavily debated topic.
