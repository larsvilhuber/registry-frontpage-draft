abstract: "We introduce a modified version of the die-in-the-cup paradigm to study (dis-)honest behavior under time pressure. Replacing the regular die with one that has a distinct color on its either side enables us to manipulate the amount of familiarity with the randomization device. This both removes the limitations of the original paradigm and allows for a test of theories that suggest that (dis-)honest behavior is affected by the relative difficulty of generating false reports.

We also replace the cup with a simple mechanical device for better control over the very process of rolling the die and collect mouse movement data from the participants to investigate the present behavioral archetypes.

Our main finding is that time pressure leads to more dishonest behavior, but only if the regular die is used. We also find that when given the time to deliberate, the participants generally report lower values if the regular rather than color die is used."
