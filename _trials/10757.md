abstract: "In the past years, nudges have gained popularity to alter household energy choices. However, in existing literature, low-income households are generally underrepresented. Yet, in the context of rising energy prices and inequality, it becomes more and more important to understand the barriers to energy efficiency of vulnerable groups. This study addresses such literature gap, by testing the effectiveness of nudges in increasing energy efficiency investments of low-income households.  We partner with a nation-wide energy efficiency assistance program in Germany that has assisted more than 400,000 low-income households since 2009. Together we implement a natural field experiment, and test the effects of information letter framings and the provision of reminders on subsequent energy efficiency investments."
