abstract: "The proliferation of misinformation can increase polarization, erode trust in public institutions, and pose significant risks to democracy. This problem is exacerbated in developing countries where social media growth has brought many online, many of whom lack the essential digital skills needed to competently navigate digital spaces. Through a randomized controlled trial in Lahore, Pakistan, we test whether interventions designed to educate social media users about misinformation (including deep- fake misinformation) can improve indicators of truth discernment, reduce emotional reactions to news items, and decrease polarization.
