abstract: "We investigate whether small and micro entrepreneurs react to information about the provision of consulting and training services. We are able to identify their perceived interest of the services, willingness to pay and preferences for service provider - public or private. We also test different heterogeneous effects. We aim to build on the growing literature of information experiments in a context of entrepreneurship in Mozambique. "
