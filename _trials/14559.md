abstract: "Crop residue burning is a major concern in developing countries, especially in India, where it exposes millions of people to extremely high levels of air pollution. Time constraints between harvesting rice and sowing wheat combined with lack of technical knowledge around relatively new methods of crop residue management encourages burning. Using a randomised controlled trial, this project will evaluate a program of subsidising early maturity rice seeds (which allow farmers more time to manage residues) along with technical training on methods of managing residues to rice farmers in Punjab, India. I evaluate the overall impact of these interventions on crop residue burning and agricultural production."
