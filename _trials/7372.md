abstract: "A sample that is representative for the German adult population is drawn and randomly assigned to five experimental conditions that differ in the amount of true information given prior to a decision whether and at what time to retire an EU ETS allowance at a financial cost. The information describes the market stability reserve (MSR) and its implications on how the timing of retirement influences the actual amount of greenhouse gas emissions saved. The level of detail ("complexity") of the description is manipulated across the experimental conditions. The hypothesis is that increasing levels of complexity increase the willingness to delay allowance retirement for a higher climate benefit, but reduce the overall willingness to voluntarily abate by retiring an allowance."
