abstract: "With millions of people worldwide impacted by human trafficking every year, there is a strong need for high-quality interventions to support survivors in obtaining lasting freedom. The Freedom Greenlight is a case management tool that situates the survivor as the lead decision-maker in identifying their own strengths, vulnerabilities, and priorities in obtaining aftercare services. This small pilot will use a randomized control trial design to preliminarily evaluate the impact of the Freedom Greenlight on survivor well-being and reintegration as compared to current standards of care in a large-scale anti-trafficking program in Uganda. The findings from this research will be used to deepen knowledge about the most effective components of programs that support survivors of trafficking. Results will be leveraged to develop implementable tools for policymakers and practitioners that can be adopted by any aftercare program that aims to support survivors in reintegration and lasting freedom."
