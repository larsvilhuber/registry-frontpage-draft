abstract: "Harmful gender norms, such as female genital cutting and child marriage affect millions of girls in developing countries. These customs have a strong detrimental effect on womenâ€™s human capital accumulation, empowerment and wellbeing, thus perpetuating gender inequality. Yet we have little causal evidence on what policies are able to eradicate them. In this project we address the following research questions: Can a multi-faceted policy intervention that combines information provision and the acquisition of soft-skills reduce the practice of harmful gender norms? What is the role of peers in improving individuals' attitudes towards harmful norms?

We are collaborating with UNICEF and local NGOs in Burkina Faso to evaluate a program aiming to change attitudes towards child marriage and female genital cutting (FGC) among adolescent girls and boys in Burkina Faso. The program creates adolescent clubs for girls and separately for boys. The clubs are meant to provide a safe space for youth to interact and to create a platform for improving the youth's attitudes towards harmful gender norms. To achieve this objective, local mentors are trained to facilitate discussions in the clubs, offering information on consequences of child marriages/FGC, enabling dialogue and sensitization about harmful traditions. We evaluate the impact of the program on girls and boys' attitudes towards FGC and child marriage by randomizing the program at the village level.

In order to answer the second research question (on the role of peers in improving individuals' attitudes towards harmful norms) we induce random variation in the composition of the clubs in term of attitudes towards FGC and child marriage. In some villages, we incentivize youth with more progressive attitudes towards FGC and child marriage to participate in the club (henceforth "targeted incentives"). The incentives are cash transfers, provided by mobile money transfers, conditional on attending the club. In the rest of the treatment villages, we provide similar incentives to randomly selected youth to participate to the club (henceforth "random incentives"). By comparing the impact of the program in villages with targeted v.s. random incentives, we aim to quantify the role of having peers with better attitudes towards FGC and child marriage. "
