abstract: "This paper describes the analysis plan for a randomized experiment examining the effect of poverty on anti-sociality. This study aims to identify the extent to which poverty, through individual cognition and decision making, can influence behavior typically classified as anti-social (dishonesty, aggression, etc.). We simulate poverty in the lab by inducing a priming effect which makes salient psychological states associated with poverty. We observe anti-social behavior with a battery of tasks and questionnaires selected to obtain a broad measure of anti-sociality. We conducted this experiment with a sample of 200 respondents from the Kibera and Viwandani slums, two of Nairobi's largest informal settlements that suffer from both economic hardship and violent crime. This plan outlines our outcomes of interest and econometric approach."
