abstract: "This paper reports the results of a large field experiment that we designed and conducted to investigate gay discrimination in the rental market. Using a popular Portuguese housing rental website, we randomly selected properties in Lisbon and its suburban areas. We then sent four different emails to each landlord, which vary in two dimensions: length (short vs. long) and sexual orientation (heterosexual vs homosexual couple) communicated in the e-mail signature. 
We believe that our findings will point out the importance of exploring LGBT discrimination in greater detail. This can only be done with proper identification strategies that reveal hidden discriminatory practices to better orient future public policies.
