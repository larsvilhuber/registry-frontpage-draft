abstract: "The proverb "easy come, easy go" tells us that the regret from losing something depends upon how hard we worked to get it. Normative economic theory assumes, however, that liquid wealth is fungible irrespective of its source; how a dollar is obtained should not affect what we buy with that dollar or the risk we are willing to take investing that dollar. Thaler and Johnson (1990) dispute that claim with a series of experiments demonstrating that people make different choices with money that has been easily or unexpectedly obtained. Thaler argues that people behave as if income and expenses are assigned to separate mental accounts with limited fungibility between accounts (Thaler 1999; Shefrin and Thaler 1988). Money easily gained is likely to end up in a mental account from which money is easily spent and readily wagered. Hard earned money is likely to land in a mental account from which money is more carefully spend and less readily wagered. For most people, most money is of the earned variety.

In economics laboratory experiments, participants are typically given an endowment equivalent to a couple of hours’ wages. Such endowments encourage participants to pay attention, exert more effort, and try to make choices that lead to higher earnings within the design of the experiment. However, Thaler and Johnson (1990) argue that when people lose money they consider to be a windfall gain, the loss is likely to be coded as a reduction in the gain which “doesn’t hurt as much as losing one’s own cash” (p. 657). Thus laboratory participants who mentally code money given to them in a laboratory as a windfall gain, distinct and separate from their earned income and savings, may display much less risk aversion in the laboratory than they do in their daily lives.

Our purpose is to demonstrate that in an experimental laboratory setting subjects asked to make risky choices take more risk with money they were given by the experimenter than money they earned. These differences in risk taking are dramatic and raise questions about inferences drawn from prior risk taking experiments with endowed money."
