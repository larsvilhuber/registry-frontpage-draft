abstract: "We are conducting an RCT on encouraging Influenza vaccinations among older adults in poor regions in China. We recruit participants following the three criteria: (1) aged 60 or above; (2) not vaccinated against the flu yet for this year; (3) eligible for local vaccine policy. We randomize participants equally into 3 three arms, (1) control, (2) receiving a modified version of the most effective text-based nudges in Milkman, et al. (2021), and (3) receiving a lottery of getting vouchers for flu vaccination. We collect survey data before and after the nudges or lottery as well as administrative data on vaccination, other health-related behaviors and outcomes, and health expenditure for program evaluation."
