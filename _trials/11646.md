abstract: "The study design is a randomized control trial that compares the reading proficiency of students that receive the 1:1 high dosage tutoring support plus the enrichment tutoring to that of students that receive only the 1:1 high dosage tutoring support. The tutoring program began in August 2022 in 8 schools; 14 first grade and 5 second grade classrooms (19 classrooms in total). This study involves 255 students enrolled in 19 classrooms identified by the school district who agreed to participate. Approximately half of the students in each classroom are randomly assigned to receive the enrichment tutoring along with the 1:1 high dosage tutoring (treatment group, N=131) and approximately half of the students were assigned to receive only the 1:1 high dosage tutoring (control group, N=124).
