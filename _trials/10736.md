abstract: "This project will treat the answer to the question of how the latest insights from educational research can be shared with many teachers in a cost-efficient manner: The cascading model of knowledge dissipation. The rationale behind the cascading model is to focus on training a small number of teacher champions (e.g., one or two teachers per school) who then act as agents of change, sharing their new skills with colleagues at their local school, thereby multiplying the effect of the training program. The aim of the project is to scientifically evaluate an in-service teacher training program that relies on such a cascading model to dissipate its message: The School-based In-Service Teacher Training (SITT) implemented by the Swiss NGO Helvetas Tanzania. The evaluation will be designed as a randomized controlled trial (RCT), to identify the causal effect that the program has on (i) teaching styles of teachers who directly participate in the program, (ii) learning outcomes of their pupils, (iii) teaching styles of teacher who were only exposed to the program through cascading, and (iv) the learning outcomes of their pupils. By answering these questions, the project will inform the scientific discourse on whether the evaluated teacher-training program helped foster measurable knowledge dissipation through the cascading model.
