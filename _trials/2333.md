abstract: "A key element of participatory development is the involvement of beneficiary communities in the decision-making process relative to the intervention. However, participation rates in community actions are typically low and participants are highly self-selected, with agents with higher vested interests or lower participation costs more likely to participate in the decision-making process. In this project, we study the determinants and consequences of participation and self-selection into community decision-making. 

The project is conducted within a randomized controlled trial which offers rural Bangladeshi communities the opportunity to build a public source of safe water.  The project process requires communities to take collective decisions over key features of the project at a public consultation meeting.  

We conduct a randomized evaluation of the impact of sending SMS reminders about the time and location of the public meeting on the number and characteristics of participants in the decision-making process; on meeting dynamics; on the results of the deliberation process; on the resultant effect on drinking water quality. Among those communities where households are reminded via SMS about the community meeting, we vary the content of the reminder.  Half the households receive a message designed to prime participants to consider access to safe water as a collective problem; half receive a message framing access to safe water as an individual problem.  

In our empirical analysis, we will first provide a detailed description of the characteristics of households that participated in the community meetings. We will exploit the experimental variation in order to evaluate: (i) the impact of sending SMS-reminders; (ii) whether the effects vary with the content of the information included in the SMS."
