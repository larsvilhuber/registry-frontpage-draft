abstract: "This research studies the impacts of financial literacy on financial and psychological well-being of microfinance borrowers in rural Nigeria. We implement a randomized control trial to test the effectiveness of providing a financial literacy training to loan borrowers within a microfinance institution. Having already qualified for and received loans from a microfinance institution, the study explores whether and to what extent financial literacy improves financial and well-being for these rural dwellers."
