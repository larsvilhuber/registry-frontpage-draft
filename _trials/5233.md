abstract: "This experiment will generate evidence on the use of various (behaviorally informed) engineering measures for decreasing driversâ€™ speeds on road spots at which accident rates are much higher than the average. In a randomized control trial, we will compare three different strategies of road markings that drivers are exposed to when approaching a risky road spot. "
