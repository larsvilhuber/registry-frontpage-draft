abstract: "In Spain, the reform of the Violence Against Women (VAW) law (Royal Decree-Law 9/2018) has introduced the possibitlity that individuals report instances of VAW without the necessity of involving the police or the court. This approach, termed "soft reporting," provides victims or witnesses with the option to report to social services. By doing so, they can access legal, economic, and psychological support without the obligation to disclose the identity of the aggressor. This approach is anticipated to streamline the reporting process, reducing costs, and eliminating barriers that may hinder reporting.

The findings of a prior experiment (AEARCTR-0010397) indicated a greater willingness among witnesses to intervene when presented with the soft reporting option as opposed to the hard reporting alternative. The present study endeavors to elucidate the difference in witnesses' intervention between the hard and soft reporting options when witnesses encounter different scenarios of VAW: one characterised by depicting physical violence and certainty, and another featuring heightened ambiguity and indications of psychological violence..
