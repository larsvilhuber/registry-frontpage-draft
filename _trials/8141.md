abstract: "Approximately 24 percent of children under the age of five in Ecuador are stunted, according to World Bank figures, and reversing this in the early years is critical to build human capital so all children can thrive and succeed. The Government of Ecuador is seeking to improve child nutrition during the first 1000 days of life, by revamping existing nationwide programs where program staff discuss prenatal care, early child development, healthy nutrition, breastfeeding, and hygiene. Due to COVID-19 these services are being provided virtually. This evaluation will test whether sending text messages to program staff members (educators) leads to increased motivation and quality of the services they provide to caregivers, families, and children.
