abstract: "A series of recent studies has found converging evidence for the following effect. Experimental subjects are willing to engage in economic transactions that impose costs on uninvolved third parties at lower levels of personal monetary benefits when these decisions are made by pairs or larger groups of subjects as compared to when subjects make the same decisions individually (see, e.g.: Falk & Szech 2013, Science; Irlenbusch & Saxler, 2015, IZA Disc. Paper 9240; Bartling et al. 2015, QJE). Our experiment investigates whether an analogous effect can also be observed for economic transactions that have positive effects on uninvolved third parties."
