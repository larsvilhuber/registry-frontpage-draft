abstract: "Institutions in agricultural value chains play a substantial role in addressing market imperfections affecting value chain performance and actors. As such, they condition the path of agricultural transformation. For example, financial instruments available to value chain actors determine who gets access to credit, and whether poor farmers can undertake optimal agricultural commercialization and storage strategy. The existing evidence suggests that farmers in developing countries, are often unable to take advantage of post-harvest price fluctuations and are forced to sell their production right after harvest to satisfy immediate cash needs, when prices are lowest. To the extent that this is verified, financial instruments which can relieve capital constraints immediately after harvest would yield sizeable impacts on farmers’ agricultural income. While such view is shared by many development economists, little is known about the actual effectiveness of various financial institutions or innovations, in the agricultural value chain. Our project will contribute to filling this gap by assessing, with a Randomized Controlled Trial, the impact of Warehouse Receipts Systems (WRS) on farmer’s access to post-harvest credit, storage patterns, income and overall welfare. Using a two-stage randomization design, we will capture externalities inside group of producers and test if the program may also increase selling prices for non-treated producers in treated groups. This research is embedded into a pilot WRS program being implemented by the Government of Senegal in the rice sector, with technical support from the International Financial Corporation (IFC). "
