abstract: "The aim of this experiment is to examine whether having to make consumption decisions publically leads people to borrow in order to be able to signal higher status then they actually achieved. Participants are paid depending on their performance in a test that involves questions designed to measure intelligence. Participants that perform well on the test are able to buy better quality pens. Participants that perform less well are can still buy better quality pens, but have to take a loan for this. There are three treatments, in the first treatment the decision is taken privately on the computer, in a second treatment participants have to announce their choices publically, in a third treatment participants make their decisions on a computer, but can see the choices participants in the same session took. The shopping round is followed by a slider task. We test if participants in different treatment work harder in order to earn more following the shopping round."
