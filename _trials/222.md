abstract: "Learning difficulties can emerge very early in a child's life. If these problems are not addressed at an early stage, children can fall further and further behind in class, making it even more difficult for them to succeed to school. Additionally, low self-confidence and frustration may compound the problem, threatening the childâ€™s future forever. For this reason, identifying and addressing learning problems at an early age is an important challenge for any education system. Remedial education is one possible way to tackle these difficulties. The intervention, provided by a publicly funded NGO, consists of offering to five underachievers in first grade an intensive tutoring program (four 1.5 hour  sessions each week) focused on reading books and informal language games. The intervention was provided to some schools randomly selected. 

The comparason between treatment and control schools did not exhibit significant positive treatment effects, compared to school routine work with underachievers."
