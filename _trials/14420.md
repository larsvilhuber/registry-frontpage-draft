abstract: "This project examines the decisions of human participants to opt into or out of conflict in a game with private information. Each of two players will privately observe a "secret number," which are iid random draws from a uniform distribution between 0 and 100. The players then choose simultaneously "Red" or "Green." Depending on the treatment, if both (either) player chooses Green, then both players get a payoff of 60, but if either (both) players choose Red, then the player with the higher secret number gets a payoff of 100, while the other gets 0. We compare treatments in which conflict is unilateral or mutual between subjects. Within subjects, we also compare these treatments to modified treatments in which each player also has an unobserved "hidden number," also iid random draws from a uniform distribution between 0 and 100. If conflict occurs (by unilateral or mutual choice) then each player's secret number is compared with the same player's hidden number. If a player's secret number is higher than the same player's hidden number, the player gets a payoff of 100, otherwise 0. These treatments remove the adverse selection effects of the main treatments so that Bayesian Nash equilibrium changes, but fully cursed equilibrium does not."
