abstract: "Using online experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), we will investigate what constitutes a fair allocation of risk in ultimatum bargaining. There are two agents, a proposer and a responder. We are interested in how offer and acceptance decisions differ when the proposer offers a probabilistic allocation of an indivisible asset, versus the standard case in which the asset is divisible and the proposer proposes a deterministic surplus allocation. We are also interested in how the timing of the resolution of uncertainty affects behavior.    "
