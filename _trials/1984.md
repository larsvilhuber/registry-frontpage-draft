abstract: "In the United States, a black-white achievement gap in education outcomes begins to manifest itself as early as two years of age. In fact, the typical black 17-year-old reads at the proficiency level of the typical white 13-year-old. Although policymakers have attempted to close this achievement gap through a variety of measures there has been mixed success rates. In particular, debate exists around a school-centered approach (in which strong schools alone can reduce the achievement gap) versus a community-based approach (in which community programs can close the gap). Using lottery and instrumental variable identification strategies, researchers analyze the causal impact on test scores of attending the Promise Academy charter schools within the Harlem Children's Zone, a non-profit organization that offers community programs and other comprehensive services to a 97-block area in Harlem, New York City in which 72.8% of the youth are black. The main result suggests that the effects of attending an HCZ middle school are enough to close the black-white achievement gap in math. In elementary schools, the effects can close the racial achievement gap in both mathematics and English Language Arts. The evidence suggests that the Promise Academy student performance was driven by the school itself as opposed to other HCZ community programs. "
