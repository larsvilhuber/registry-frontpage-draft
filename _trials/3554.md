abstract: "To prepare children for school, a stimulating home environment for learning and development is vital, since very young children spend most of their time at home. In the context of our study, where fewer than 50 percent of young children are enrolled in preschool, the government is expanding preschool enrollment and, at the same time, promoting stimulation at home by both mothers and fathers to ensure that poor children and those living in areas with low preschool access are better prepared to learn when they enter school. Parents will be offered a group program that will provide information on child development and activities to do at home; there will also be a communications campaign aimed at parents, particularly fathers, on how to promote young children’s development, and on the services available, such as preschools, and why children benefit from these early education programs. Using a combination of data sources, including nationwide household survey data, administrative records, and parents’ self-reports, this evaluation will test the relative effectiveness of the face-to-face and the communications campaign, as well as the impact of targeting on fathers, a group shown to be typically less involved in child engagement activities than mothers."
