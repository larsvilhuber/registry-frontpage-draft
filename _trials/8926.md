abstract: "There is growing evidence that compliance costs affect take-up of government benefits. In the Affordable Care Act (ACA) health insurance marketplaces, households cannot receive health insurance premium subsidies without periodically updating their application information, a process known as consent for income verification. Each year, thousands of households fail to update their application and experience large premium increases due to the loss of subsidies. The goal of this project was to identify the effect of low-cost nudges - email reminders â€“ on compliance with the application update requirement to remain eligible for premium subsidies."
