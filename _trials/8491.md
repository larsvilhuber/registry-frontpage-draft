abstract: "We explore the effect of providing students with information on female role models and gender stereotypes on STEM careers on peers' recognition. We use a two-phase randomization design with different degrees of saturation at the classroom level: 20%, 50%, and 80%. We randomly assign students (grades 9-11) from 20 schools in Lima, Peru, to receive two treatments before nominating peers to represent their classroom in a knowledge contest: (i) watching videos about successful women in STEM careers and (ii) receiving feedback on an Implicit Association Test (IAT) about gender and career choices. Classrooms compete in a contest with STEM-related and non-STEM-related questions. Students nominate three peers to represent their classroom in the inter-classroom competition. We will test the effect of reducing gender stereotypes on peer nominations in STEM-related and non-STEM-related subjects. We will also study efficiency gains measured by the performance of students with more nominations in the competition. "
