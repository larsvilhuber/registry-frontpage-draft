abstract: "The city of Manizales, capital of the Department of Caldas in central Colombia, is a mid-size Colombian city, with population close to half a million, and approximately 55,000 students in public basic education grades 1 to 11. Manizales is undertaking a major revision of its educational programs under the leadership of the mayor and in conjunction with a very active civic society. Authorities are interested in tackling the perceived low quality of education, as shown in national and international standardized tests. Our intervention aims to address the quality problem directly, and encompasses two experiments, one at the household level (information intervention) and one at the school level (family/school engagement intervention). The information intervention is designed to change the internal investment of the family as well as their relationship with the school. The family/school engagement intervention aims to increase engagement, trust, and communication between families and teachers/schools. We are interested to estimate average treatment effects and heterogeneity effects by test performance at baseline. The hypothesis is that parents from low-baseline performers have less information and may react more to treatment. We are interested in the independent impact of family treatment and school treatment, but also in the interaction between them. The unit of observation of the household experiment is household level; the unit of observation of the school experiment, will be the teacher level. "
