abstract: "In this project, we will study the impact of religious beliefs on perceptions about sources of inequality and willingness to redistribute. We will elicit choices of participants in two situations with unequal income of two workers, which arises either randomly (coin flip) or due to merit (productivity of the workers). We will elicit measures of willingness to redistribute income between the two workers, perceptions of the causes of the original inequality, and set of beliefs about the characteristics of the two workers among a sample of members of 250 Christian churches in Western Kenya. We will experimentally manipulate whether the choices are made in the control or in the treatment condition in which the importance of the role of God in people’s lives will be made more salient. "
