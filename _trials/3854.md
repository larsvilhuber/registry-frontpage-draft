abstract: "We use a clustered randomized controlled trial in 140 rural Bangladeshi villages to examine the effects of an intensive information campaign to educate mothers on caring of infant children. In addition to group-based monthly information sessions, mothers in a randomly selected subset of villages were provided one-to-one instructions and demonstration through fortnightly home visits. We examine the effects of such information campaign and home visits on maternal awareness and practices regarding child nutrition and feeding, hygiene, home environment, child health, maternal health as well as on childâ€™s motor and cognitive development. The intervention would provide plausible causal pathways through which child health outcomes could be impacted, and in particular the role of knowledge and awareness in child development. Our intervention design would allow us to examine the spillover effects within households (e.g., siblings/cousins) and neighboring households. "
