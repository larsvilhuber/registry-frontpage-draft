abstract: "This project examines how working as a tax collector affects local bureaucrat performance. We exploit random variation in whether local bureaucrats known as avenue chiefs were responsible for property tax collection (treatment), or whether agents of the tax ministry collected taxes within avenue chiefsâ€™ jurisdictions instead (control). We estimate the performance of avenue chiefs by measuring how they choose to allocate scarce benefits from a government antipoverty program in their community. The resulting distribution of antipoverty benefits enables us to measure the extent to which chiefs targeted the program toward the neediest families in the community as well as diversion, nepotism, ethnic favoritism, and taxpayer reciprocity. We use additional cross-randomized interventions and survey data to shed light on mechanisms."
