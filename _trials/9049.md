abstract: "We conduct an audit of an online marketplace in a typical patriarchal context of Pakistan and do an experimental evaluation to measure gender bias. Based on a repeated weekly census of listings on the marketplace, we select sellers who regularly sell on the marketplace and contact these sellers through buyer profiles that unambiguously signal gender without revealing caste, ethnicity, or other economic markers. Each seller is contacted twice, once by each gender, following carefully crafted and pre-determined bargaining scripts. We record and analyze economic variables such as offered prices, delivery discounts, and product characteristics for each gender. In addition, we record any unsolicited attempts from sellers at communicating with each gender, such as messages, phone calls, friend requests, etc. We also analyze differences in the tone and feel of the sellersâ€™ language through speech analysis and natural language processing. Our paper presents unique evidence on not just gender discrimination in prices and product characteristics but also on other facets of online interactions that may be a hurdle in the inclusion of women in the online marketplaces of patriarchal societies such as Pakistan.
