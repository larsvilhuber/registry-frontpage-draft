abstract: "This study assesses the effects of video-mediated agricultural extension provision on both farmers and extension agents in Ethiopia. The study evaluates a public extension program that integrates informational video screening with extension service provision to improve farmers’ knowledge about specific crop management technologies and practices, and to accelerate the adoption of improved agricultural technologies and practices. Specifically, the study focuses on a program piloted by the Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), regional bureaus of agriculture, and Digital Green, a social enterprise, in the country’s four most agriculturally important regional states. 

Our study investigates three main questions. First, to what extent does video-mediated extension lead to increased farmer adoption of improved agricultural technologies and practices by smallholder farmers? Second, is extension targeted at both spouses of the household more effective than when targeted at the (typically male) household head only? Third, does video-mediated extension lead to improvements in extension agent motivation, effort, and performance? 

The study uses a randomized controlled trial to explore the impact of video-mediated extension on the production of three crops (teff, wheat, maize) with three technologies (row planting, lower seeding rate, and fertilizer top dressing) that have been prioritized by the Government of Ethiopia. We use a three-arm stratified cluster randomized design, with stratification at the level of the district (woreda) and clusters at the level of the village cluster (kebele), which is also the primary level at which agricultural extension is organized in Ethiopia. Within each woreda, kebeles were randomly allocated to one of three groups: (T0), a control group in which the Government of Ethiopia’s conventional extension approach is targeted at the (typically male) household head; (T1), a treatment group (denoted “Regular DG”) in which Digital Green’s standard video-mediated approach is targeted at the (typically male) household head; and (T2), a treatment group (denoted “DG + spouse”) in which Digital Green’s standard video-mediated approach is targeted at both the household head and his spouse. In each group, the same suite of agricultural technologies and practices was promoted. The design allows us to compare how farmers respond to the same information regarding improved technologies and practices when the information is disseminated through the standard extension approach versus when the approach is supported by video mediation. 

Data for this study are drawn from a series of surveys conducted among farmers and extension agents participating in the study. A random sample of more than 890 extension agents participating in one of the three treatment arms were surveyed with the rollout (i.e., at baseline) during the 2017 meher (rainy) season in May-June 2017. This was followed by a survey of more than 2,400 randomly selected households assigned to one of the three treatment arms after the initial (year 1) rollout in early 2018, following the meher season harvest, as well as a follow-up survey of same extension agents. A subsequent round of household and DA surveys are scheduled for early 2019, following the year 2 rollout of the implementation. Data on household, farm, kebele, and extension agent characteristics were collected in this initial series of surveys and will continue to be collected in subsequent surveys. Data are also collected on key outcome variables, including access to extension services, knowledge about the focal technologies, uptake and adoption of these technologies, and changes in productivity and marketing.
