abstract: "A large body of lab experimental evidence exists showing that a nudge shrouding the credit card minimum payment option increases hypothetical manual credit card payments. I conduct a new field experiment to test whether this finding extrapolates to increase credit card payments in the field. I test two nudges that help to understand the credit card payment amounts that consumers target."
