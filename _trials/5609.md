abstract: "During this time of pandemic, we seek to understand how citizens view a set of fundamental tradeoffs between civil liberties, economic wellbeing and health. We have devised a novel survey instrument that seeks to capture these trade-offs explicitly. In addition to leveraging quasi-experimental variation from the severity of crisis to identify the relevant trade-offs, we will also experimentally manipulate the salience of health or civil liberties through two information treatments.
