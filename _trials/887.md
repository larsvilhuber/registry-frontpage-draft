abstract: "This pre-analysis plan outlines the hypotheses to be tested and the specifications to be used in the analysis of the Truckee Meadows Water Authority’s (TMWA’s) water conservation messaging pilot program conducted in summer 2015. This study will consider the impact on residential customers’ water use of five mailers sent to a random sample of single family residential customers in July and August 2015. These five mailers included (i) a “tips sheet” with suggestions for how to conserve outdoor water use; (ii) information on customers’ water use history; (iii) information on how customers’ water bill is determined and the potential savings from conservation; and (iv) social norms messaging that compares customers’ total water use to the median water use for other single family residences in their neighborhood with similar yard size and number of bedrooms. The experimental design will allow us to analyze (i) heterogeneity in response to the treatments along multiple dimensions, including customers’ total water use, assessed home value, and rate structure; (ii) the differential impact of mailers on indoor versus outdoor water use; and (iii) the mechanism through which social comparison messaging influence water use (i.e., whether social comparison messaging influences customer water use by highlighting social norms about the appropriate level of water use or by sending the customers a signal about the privately efficient behavior of other customers serviced by the utility.)"
