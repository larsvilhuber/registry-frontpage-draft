abstract: "In many environments, agents need to learn a payoff function of their choices. The fact that these functions are often qualitatively complicated, for example encoding many interaction effects among several choice dimensions, has led many economists to model agents' learning of these functions as black boxes. Since it is costly to explore choices, risk averse agents learning payoffs through a black box can easily get stuck in some local maxima, usually only alleviated by observing an exogenous signal of a better alternative. But black-box learning is not the only learning mode available to real world agents, who can appeal to scientific advancements. Science has tapered the complexity of complicated functions to make them more useful for both ex-ante prediction and ex-post extrapolation, trading off exactness with a global model of the “first order” structure. We consider two levels of scientific advancements: (1) a conceptual dimension reduction, rewriting complicated functions in a smaller space of conceptual features, and (2) mechanistic knowledge of an approximating function to the true payoff function, described on the domain of conceptual features. We examine whether equipping agents we hypothesize to be predominantly black-box learners of a relevant payoff function, with information about these two levels of scientific discovery, progressively improves their learning efficiency.

Specifically, we consider the problem of synthetic fertilizer choice among smallholder tomato farmers in Eastern Uganda. Qualitative evidence tells us that they have a black-box understanding of this important technology and are not deploying them optimally, which is also supported by other empirical work in Africa. We provide agricultural extension demonstrations to 900 tomato farmers where we demonstrate the causal impact of an interesting fertilizer recipe, and randomize the provision of two additional explanations relevant to why (biophysically) this recipe achieved its result: (1) a conceptual dimension reduction of fertilizers to the three macronutrients that drive their effects; (2) mechanistic knowledge about how these nutrients move through observable features of the soil and participate in plant growth. We measure impacts of these components on incentivized beliefs about fertilizer use, WTP for novel fertilizers, and choices in a bandit problem. We consider payoffs (yields and profits) on both a grey soil archetype on which we demonstrated the recipe, as well as a counterfactual “black soil’, to speak to signal translation across contexts with heterogeneous returns. We also measure a variety of other welfare-relevant aspects documented in the psychology literature to improve with mechanistic understanding."
