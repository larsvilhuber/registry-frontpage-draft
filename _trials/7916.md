abstract: "This study aims to provide evidence about how the three dark triad personality traits (Machiavellianism, narcissim and psychopathy) affect risk taking in the lab. Without social context, we expect that neither of these three traits are associated with more risk seeking in a Holt and Laury (2005) risk elicitation task. We expect that individuals scoring high in psychopathy however show the tendency to gamble more in a skewed investment choice with a negative expected return.
Adding social comparison to the picture, we expect to find that individuals invest more into skewed assets and  that dark triad personality traits are consistently associated with more risk taking."
