abstract: "The Training for Productivity (TFP) project aims to improve the Ghanaian Civil Serviceâ€™s capacity by designing, implementing and evaluating novel individual and group-based training methods for bureaucrats. The training programs will be experimentally implemented as part of a standard package of training sessions coordinated by the Office of the Head of Civil Service (OHCS) and the Civil Service Training Centre (CSTC) of Ghana. The project findings will feed directly into the work of the OHCS, which requested the project and with whom we are working closely. As the trainings are being delivered by Civil Service personnel and through existing training systems, the research findings will have external validity and it will be straightforward to scale-up and sustain them."
