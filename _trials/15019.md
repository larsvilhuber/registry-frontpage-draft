abstract: "The increasing prevalence of remote learning and working underscores the importance of understanding effective strategies for virtual collaboration. This study investigates the role of an initial "kick-off" meeting in shaping team dynamics and outcomes in remote, project-based learning environments. We aim to assess whether such meetings enhance team cohesion, individual satisfaction, and overall team performance. Additionally, we explore the effects on individual contributions to team projects and end-of-semester academic performance. By integrating measures of emotional intelligence, cognitive skills, and leadership capabilities, as well as demographic and academic data, this study provides a comprehensive examination of the factors influencing successful virtual teamwork and individual learning outcomes. The findings will offer valuable insights into optimizing team-based approaches in remote educational settings."
