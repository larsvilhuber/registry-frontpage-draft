abstract: "We provide the research design and analysis plan for evaluating the impact of a brief telecounseling intervention that aims to improve the mental health and wellbeing of women in rural Bangladesh. Due to COVID-19 lockdown and movement restrictions, women in developing countries are potentially experiencing a heavier burden of household chores and unpaid care responsibilities, and an increase in domestic violence, which are likely to affect their mental health. We want to evaluate whether providing mental support to adult women improves (i) their own mental health, (ii) compliance with COVID-19 precautionary measures, (iii) physical health of self, children, and other household members, and (iv) their own happiness, life satisfaction, and aspiration for the future.
