abstract: "We investigate the performance of a new approach to measure time preferences. The new approach entails asking individuals to make choices between receiving high stakes lottery tickets at different points in time, in a similar way as conventional time-preference elicitation methods. The study will compare measurements using conventional methods involving low stakes (convex budget sets, Andreoni et al., 2012) with measurements using the new approach, across (i) a sample of students participating in November 2019, (ii) a sample of students participating in February/March 2020 and (iii) a sample of unemployed job seekers participating in 2020 (exact time to be determined). The first sample may face large expenditure shocks due to St Nicholas and Christmas time, the second sample is unlikely to face any expenditure/income shocks, and the third sample is expected to face large income shocks related to finding employment. These features are key to testing the performance of the new time-preference elicitation method."
