abstract: "I study gender discrimination in online negotiations. To do so, I post simple classified advertisements on the largest platform for such classifieds in Germany and collect offers. I then ask for a discount and randomly sign the replies with a male or a female name, respectively. In the negotiations, I try to isolate statistical discrimination by using two treatment arms. The first treatment consists of the name only, whereas the second one signals knowledgability with the topic and negotiation experience. I study how often potential partners send a lower second offer as a reaction to the initiation of a negotiation and, if they send one, how large the discount is. Since all communication takes place via chat, I can apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods and text analysis methods to study potentially different communication with women and men.
