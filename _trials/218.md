abstract: "This document outlines the analysis plan for the study of the effects of acute stress on productivity, time preference and risk preference. Our subject pool consists of urban poor in Nairobi Kenya, from Kibera and Viwandani - two of the city's largest informal settlments. We use the cold pressor task to manipulate participants stress. By randomly assigning participants into the stressful or non stressful conditions we can estimate the causal impacts of acute stress on productivity and decision making."
