abstract: "Bayesian updating is the dominant theory of learning. However, the theory is silent about how individuals react to events that were previously unforeseeable or unforeseen. In previous experiments, we tested if subjects update their beliefs according to “reverse Bayesianism”, under which the relative likelihoods of prior beliefs remain unchanged after an unforeseen event materializes. We found that participants do not systematically deviate from reverse Bayesianism. In this follow-up experiment, we test the robustness of this finding. Specifically, reverse Bayesianism hinges on the assumption that new events provide no information about past events, and hence the relative likelihoods should remain unchanged. This means that the expected updating according to reverse Bayesianism is indistinguishable from a null result. In this new experiment, the underlying probability distribution of the urns can change. Participants that are reverse Bayesian and not just complacent should incorporate this possibility into their updating process."
