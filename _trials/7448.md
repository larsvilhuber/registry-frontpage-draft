abstract: "The aim of this research study is to shed light on the peer review process and gauge the impacts of editorial decisions on researchers.  We hope that the survey results will spark fruitful discussions and potentially lead to improvements in the publication process. The survey elicits information from researchers on their submission history. After reading a fake decision letter on a hypothetical submission to a top-5 journal, respondents are asked to report their beliefs about whether the paper will eventually be published in that journal or any leading journal.
