abstract: "Recent literature suggests that group decisions differ from individual decisions (e.g., Feri et al., 2010; Charness and Sutter, 2012). One reason for this pattern is that also social aspects within the group play a role, due to e.g. people hiding behind a group decision or their social image concerns. A different strand of literature considers the role of social norms for economic behavior. This literature shows that social norms matter for individual behavior in many spheres, including charitable giving, tax evasion and dishonesty (e.g., Frey and Meier, 2004; Hallsworth et al. 2017; Pruckner and Sausgruber, 2013). It further suggests that people are particularly prone to react to (information about) norms in presence of uncertainty about the norm (Feldhaus et al. forthcoming). 

The aim of our project is to combine these strands of literature and to study the role of (un)certainty about social norms for individual vs group decision-making. In particular, we impose the following research questions: Does the effect of social norms differ between individual and group decisions? Does this depend on the degree of uncertainty about the norm? These questions so far remain unanswered in the literature, despite their relevance: many economic decisions are made by small groups or teams rather than individuals; examples include boards in corporations, government coalitions, or families. Furthermore, social norms are often ambiguous such that it is not perfectly clear what one ‘ought’ to do in a particular context. This makes it relevant to learn whether and how social norms affect individual vs group decisions and whether this is also related to the degree of uncertainty about the norm.

We use a laboratory experiment to shed light on our research questions. The essentials of the experimental design are as follows: we have a fully crossed 2x2 between-subjects design with individual vs group decisions and unambiguous salient vs uncertain norms. The decision problem is embedded in a standard dictator-game set up where the shared amount is our outcome variable.
