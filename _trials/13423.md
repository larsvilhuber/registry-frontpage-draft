abstract: "This study focuses on the critical role of community centers in nurturing social cohesion, particularly in conflict-affected regions. The research is situated in Jabal Mohsen and Bab al-Tabbaneh, neighborhoods in Tripoli, Lebanon, known for their distinct demographics and complex historical narratives. Against the backdrop of Lebanon's socio-political dynamics, exacerbated by the presence of displaced populations, this study aims to evaluate the impact of a community center managed by women in enhancing social cohesion among its users. Employing a mixed-methods approach, the research combines an impact evaluation with in-depth interviews, and focus group discussions with women volunteers, community members, and key stakeholders. The study objectives are twofold: first, to assess the extent of the community center's impact on social cohesion, and second, to identify the mechanisms and strategies behind the impact finding. The study's significance lies in its potential to inform policies and initiatives aimed at mitigating tensions and enhancing social stability in conflict-affected areas, particularly through the pivotal role played by women in community centers. By examining the effectiveness of this innovative approach, the research seeks to pave the way for more contextually grounded interventions that truly foster sustainable social cohesion."
