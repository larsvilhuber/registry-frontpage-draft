abstract: "This project will investigate the dynamic micro-entrepreneurs' expectations and business decisions. Like many other Sub-Saharan countries, Tanzania exhibits a landscape of numerous small-scale, unproductive firms alongside a handful of large, efficient corporations. Despite significant educational improvements, the youth's transition into formal salaried employment remains stagnant, mirroring the employment patterns of previous generations.
The first goal of this project is to identify and measure the potential over-optimism of micro-entrepreneurs in their likelihood of transitioning to a salaried position. Then, using a lab-in-the-field information treatment and first-hand longitudinal data of micro-entrepreneurs, I will causally estimate the effect of such expectations on business practices, investment decisions, and business growth.
