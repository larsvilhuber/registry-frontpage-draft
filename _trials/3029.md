abstract: "A natural field experiment is conducted to investigate the influence of a dummy evaluation category at the bottom of a feedback scale on effort provision and performance. Subjects work on a real effort task in two successive periods. A performance dependent bonus is paid for both periods. Performance is evaluated using three evaluation categories. The first category is awarded to the highest performing subjects while the lowest performing subjects are evaluated with a three.

Subjects are randomly assigned to one of three treatments. In treatment ND no dummy evaluation category is shown, i.e. subjects are shown the actual three evaluation categories. In treatment CD a 4th dummy evaluation category is shown. In treatment TD a 4th dummy evaluation category is shown and the non-usage of the 4th evaluation category is made transparent.

We hypothesize that average effort provision and performance is higher in treatment CD compared to treatment ND in the second period. We also hypothesize that average effort provision and performance is higher in treatment CD compared to treatment TD in the second period. Moreover, we hypothesize that average effort provision and performance is higher in treatment TD compared to treatment ND in the second period. We expect these effects to be strongest for those ranking lowest (third)."
