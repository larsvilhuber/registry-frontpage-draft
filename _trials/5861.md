abstract: "As COVID-19 spreads within developing countries, policymakers are grappling with the potential consequences of income losses associated with social distancing and other responses to the pandemic. Households may elect not to comply with health protocols if compliance would reduce consumption below particular thresholds. All households—both those that comply and those that do not—may face onerous consequences.

How and to what extent can cash transfers aimed at supporting consumption ameliorate the economic and health consequences of these dynamics? To shed light on this question, we evaluate a cash transfer intervention in Ghana that aims to simultaneously encourage adherence to health and social distancing guidelines, and to maintain consumption levels as much as possible given the grave epidemiological and socioeconomic threats associated with the COVID-19 pandemic’s severity.
