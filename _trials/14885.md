abstract: "We will conduct a survey experiment with Italian households to assess how individuals perceive the risks of natural disasters and to test the effectiveness of an information provision intervention. The study will target Italian residents with a wealth range between EUR 50,000 and EUR 500,000. One group will receive accurate information about natural disaster risks in Italy. We aim to evaluate how this information shapes their perception of natural disaster risks, their willingness to seek further information, and their willingness to enhance their housing insurance coverage."
