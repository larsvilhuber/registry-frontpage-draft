abstract: "In this project we test whether messages that (a) show that many people have taken an action, (b) make a person feel important to reaching a goal, and (c) the combination of the two can cause people to take an action.  We use a series of three field experiments with over thirty-four-thousand subjects. Two of these field experiments randomize messages sent in the charitable giving setting to see the effects of being made to feel important and the popularity of an action on donation rates. The final field experiment looks at the effects of these same types of messages on voter turnout rates in a university election."
