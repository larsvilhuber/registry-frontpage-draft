abstract: "Can smartphone applications be harnessed to raise the incomes of smallholder farmers? Although previous literature has shown that access to mobile phones and mobile phone-based interventions can positively affect smallholder farmers, little is known about the effects of introducing smartphone applications (apps) designed to solve market problems and increase economic activity. In this pre-analysis plan, we propose to evaluate the effects of a smartphone-based, information-sharing app for livestock producers known as the ``Virtual Collection Center''. Our population of interest consists of smallholder goat producers in rural Nepal, all of whom are women and are members of producer cooperatives. We will estimate average and heterogeneous treatment effects of the app in four domains: information sharing, animals sold, prices received and cooperative-level management outcomes. Our study will contribute to two areas of interest where little evidence currently exists: the potential of smartphone apps as a tool for agricultural development, and business development for agricultural cooperatives in developing countries."
