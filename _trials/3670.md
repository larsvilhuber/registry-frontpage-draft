abstract: "Most children in rural Guinea Bissau leave school without basic literacy and numeracy skills. Although enrolment in rural areas has increased from 24% to 60% over the past ten years, competencies in language and maths remain very low. Primary schools in rural Guinea Bissau are characterised by poorly trained, insufficient and under motivated teachers, a lack of materials for teaching and learning, poor infrastructure and inadequate didactic teaching pedagogy. Effective Intervention has designed ROPE - Raising Outcomes in Primary Education, a programme to deliver quality basic primary education for about 700 children in south rural Guinea Bissau that focus on hiring, training and monitoring teachers to provide a better quality teaching . The aim of this study is to assess the impact of this programme by comparing the test scores of children four years after the project has been implemented."
