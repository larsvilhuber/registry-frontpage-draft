abstract: "The aim is to conduct a large-scale field experiment in which we test the efficiency of an intervention. A regional sports research center sends an email to a random selection of around 600 amateur soccer coaches. In this email the coaches find a link with a two minute video in which famous Swiss football player point towards the important role that football can play in promoting inclusivity and reducing racism in society. Two weeks later, we send fictitious applications asking to join an amateur club. We use either typical Swiss- or foreign-sounding names. We compare the response rate for Swiss- and foreign-sounding names as well for coaches who received the video and those that did not."
