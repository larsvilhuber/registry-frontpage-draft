abstract: "We combine a field experiment and a lab-in-the-field experiment to analyze how improved management enhances within-firm coordination between managers and workers and that among workers. We provided management training featuring Kaizen production approach to 40 small manufacturers, randomly selected from 97 eligible manufacturers located in one garment cluster. 21 months after the completion of the training, we will conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment at each of the 97 firms, inviting an owner/manager and three workers randomly selected from the list of all workers, to play a coordination (minimum effort) game. Since we have evidence that the training improved firm-level management practices, particularly production management, among the treated firms, we will analyze whether the training also led to improved within-firm coordination, and investigate whether improved management is related with improved coordination. We also explore whether the performance in the lab-experiment is related with real world behaviors, such as, frequent meeting, regular communication, and within-firm mutual trust."
