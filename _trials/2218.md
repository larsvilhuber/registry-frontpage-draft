abstract: "The market for residential solar panels in the United States is growing rapidly, bolstered by substantial government support at the federal, state, and local levels. Yet there are concerns that this support is primarily benefiting wealthier households, due to different electricity rates, liquidity constraints, landlord-tenant issues, length of tenancy, and perhaps even preferences (Borenstein and Davis 2016, Borenstein 2017). This study examines the effect of information provision and preferred financing on the adoption of residential solar panels by low and moderate income (LMI) households. Specifically, we randomize LMI municipalities in Connecticut into those receiving a behavioral intervention focused on "community-based pro-social" messaging and "financial-based" messaging. At the same time, we are exploiting an income eligibility discontinuity for subsidized financing to LMI participants. We will measure the effect of the different messaging approaches above and below this discontinuity on the demand for residential solar systems in LMI municipalities. We will thus quantify the effects of different potential policies for encouraging the adoption of solar systems in LMI municipalities."
