abstract: "Due to low formal employment options, youth unemployment is a significant concern in developing countries. Governments and international organizations are encouraging self-employment through micro- and small-enterprise development as a solution. Because many young people do not have the skills or interest to start businesses, there is a common belief that high quality skills training programs are needed. TechnoServe's Strengthening Rural Youth Development through Enterprise program trains youth on basic life and career skills and later links them with employers or supports them in developing microenterprises. Using a randomized controlled trial, we estimate the impact of this unique and intensive soft skills training program, as well as the additional impact of receiving a cash grant. This study will provide evidence of the impact on employment and economic status, as well as looking at the mechanisms of a soft skills approach to training, including entrepreneurial and career skills, aspirations and psycho-social adjustment."
