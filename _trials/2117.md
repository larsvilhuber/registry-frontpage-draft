abstract: "Using a résumé-based correspondence test, we compare the employment consequences of an illness-related employment gap to those of an unexplained employment gap. Previous research shows that employment gaps, in general, have adverse effects on the probability of getting hired. It is not clear, however, if employers view spells of joblessness due to health issues distinctly. To shed light on this, we present a model in which employers use information on employment gaps as a signal of unobserved productivity and healthcare costs. We investigate the empirical implications of the model by sending three types of fictitious r´esum´es to real vacancies advertised online. One résumé indicates that the applicant is newly unemployed. The other résumés indicate employment gaps which are either unexplained or
explained as being related to an illness. The results of the experiment show that while the callback rate of applicants with an illness-related employment gap is lower than that of the newly unemployed, applicants with illness-related employment gaps are more likely to receive
a callback than identical applicants who provide no explanation for the gap. Our research provides evidence that employers use information on employment gaps as additional signals about workers’ unobserved productivity.
