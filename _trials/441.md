abstract: "RAND and Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) are conducting a rigorous evaluation of a credit-building loan offered at a credit union in the Midwest,  financial counseling offered over the phone, and a product add-on that encourages automated payments into a savings account called “Pay Yourself Back.” The evaluation employs a cross-cutting encouragement design, with the loan product and counseling services randomly encouraged at the start of study participation.  For participants who are encouraged to take up the loan product and open the loan, the “Pay Yourself Back” add-on will be randomized six months prior to the completion of loan repayment.  The study will examine the impact of the loan product, counseling services, and the encouragement for automated savings payments on credit, savings, debt, and loan repayment rates in the short and long term.  It will also examine whether self-selection into the loan product is indicative of credit worthiness.  "
