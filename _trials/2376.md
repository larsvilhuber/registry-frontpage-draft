abstract: "This project aims to understand how to promote and sustain health insurance enrollment in Ghana. We also evaluate the impacts of insurance coverage on a host of health outcomes and healthcare utilization. To achieve our objectives, we hired local researchers in Ghana to help run experiments and collect various household and individual data. This study is going to make two contributions to the literature. First, our study will be among the first to document evidence of intervention on enrollment sustainability of nationwide insurance. Second, our study will be among the first to focus in pricing on health insurance in low-income countries. "
