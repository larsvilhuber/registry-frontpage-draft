abstract: "We study the impact of a platform on which unemployed jobseekers can come into contact with `buddies’: former jobseekers who have recently transitioned from one occupation to another. The platform aims at facilitating conversations between the unemployed jobseekers and their buddies, so as to motivate the jobseekers to make a transition themselves. Jobseekers who are looking for work in occupations with poor labor market prospects will be invited to express their interest in the platform. Within those who express interest, we give a randomly selected group access to the platform. The others form the control group. The outcome measures of interest are employment status and earnings (both from administrative data), job search behavior (measured by activity on the public job search website), and characteristics of newly found jobs (measured using a survey)."
