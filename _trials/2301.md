abstract: "Participation in political movements has the potential to shape political institutions, public policy, and economic outcomes. In this project, we study the causal effects of a “nudge” that induces individuals to turnout to a high-stakes, anti-authoritarian protest. Studying the effects of this sort of nudge, we have two broad areas of inquiry: first, if an individual is randomly nudged to experience a political protest, how does that affect her political attitudes and subsequent political behavior? Are there short-run effects? Persistent effects? Second, does nudging individuals to participate in a protest have spillover effects on their peers’ decisions to protest? Determining whether there are peer effects in the decision to turnout to protest is important for understanding the dynamics of protest participation and protest size."
