abstract: "Life skills education and financial education are increasingly implemented to equip school-aged children with skills and competencies that are relevant to their life. How does the design of the program, especially the intensity, relate to the effectiveness of the program? Can such a program that facilitates self-awareness and future planning improve the self-confidence and aspirations of youths from marginalized backgrounds? This study will evaluate the impact of a life skills and financial education program in a district in Maharashtra, India, where many children come from historically marginalized backgrounds. We designed a randomized experiment with two treatment arms, differing by intensity (school-based program vs. school-based program with parental engagement.). Further, two priming experiments will be employed to measure if their gender and caste status constrains the participants’ self-confidence and aspirations. The purpose of this research is to determine effective strategies for addressing gaps in students’ non-academic skills, aiming to enhance long-term economic outcomes as well as psychological well-being."
