abstract: "The University of Notre Dameâ€™s Wilson Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunities (LEO), in partnership with Recovery Resource Council (RRC), will conduct a randomized-controlled trial to study whether financial incentives for therapy attendance lower therapy discontinuation and improve mental health for a sample of veterans in Texas. RRC is accredited by the Joint Commission in Behavioral Health and licensed by the State of Texas as an Outpatient Treatment Center. It is one of the largest and most comprehensive non-profit mental and behavioral healthcare providers in North Texas and provides free counseling services to hundreds of U.S. veterans annually. 

Veterans who approach RRC for individual counseling services and consent to participate will be randomly assigned to the treatment or control group. The control group will receive counseling as usual. The treatment group will receive $500 gift card payments upon completing their 6th, 12th, and 18th counseling sessions, i.e., $1,500 in gift cards for completing all 18 sessions, the usual prescribed length of therapy. Our primary focus is to examine the impact of the financial incentives on therapy attendance and attrition. In addition,  we will estimate the impact on mental health using mental health inventories collected over the course of the therapy sessions. Should we find that the financial incentives increase therapy attendance, we will also estimate key parameters of a dynamic, structural model of therapy exit timing."
