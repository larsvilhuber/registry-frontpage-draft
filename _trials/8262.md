abstract: "Cowpeas are an important cash crop for farmers in West Africa, and particularly in Niger, the
second largest cowpea producer in the world. During storage, cowpeas are highly susceptible to
degradation by the cowpea weevil. Despite the importance of this issue for millions of farming
households, adoption of a proven technology to minimize storage losses—hermetically sealed
PICS bags—remains low in some areas of Niger. In 2016 we conducted a pilot study across 63
villages and 30 markets in Niger, to understand the barriers to adoption of this technology. Based
on the insights from that study, we are conducting a 2x2 randomized control trial to address
separate and combined demand- and supply-side constraints to PICS adoption. The findings will provide
evidence relevant to poverty reduction in Niger, and will provide rigorous evidence for the global
agricultural policy community on the cost effectiveness of supply and demand interventions to
promote technology adoption."
