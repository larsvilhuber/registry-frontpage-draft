abstract: "In this experiment we will investigate the influence of two online-based entrepreneurship programmes and compare the effects of a programme with experiential design with a programme which is based on lectures by entrepreneurial role models. During this process we will be able to assess in which way the educational dimensions of “mastery experience” and “vicarious learning” influence the entrepreneurial self-efficacy of young pupils as well as their inclination to participate in high-growth oriented entrepreneurial activities.

3000 randomly selected pupils (year of birth = 2000) will be randomly divided into three groups and invited to participate in three different online-based educational programmes all of which will last for two weeks. In order to test the effectiveness of practice-based and experiential entrepreneurship education one group will be requested to perform weekly challenges and reflect on how they have been affected by the activities which they have performed and on the type of learning that they perceive to have gained from these challenges. This group will be compared to pupils who will be asked to view and reflect on two weekly presentations by entrepreneurial role models. Both of these groups will be compared to a control group of pupils who will only be requested to view and reflect on two short scientific documentaries each week. The goal of the experiment is to analyse how we can best use online-based education in order to influence pupils at an early stage of education to make them consider entrepreneurship as an attractive career choice."
