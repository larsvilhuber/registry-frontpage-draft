abstract: "This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a specific type of parenting intervention in an Irish context. We will run a randomised control trial (RCT) of the Fear-less Workshop to be delivered by our implementation partner, the Midlands Area Parenting Partnership (MAPP), called “Fear-less Triple P”, which targets parents of 6 to 14-year old’s.

Fear-less Triple P is a 6-hour small group intervention, which is run over 2 non-consecutive days for 3hrs each day. The intervention aims to educate parents about anxiety in children and the principles of a cognitive-behavioural approach to anxiety management. Each of the two 3hr sessions is facilitated by a trained and accredited Triple P practitioner. The research team will not be involved in delivering the intervention. Only MAPP practitioners, who come from a range of professions and have a recommended minimum QCF-4/5 level qualifications, will be involved in delivering the intervention. This discussion group focuses on the topic “parenting an anxious child”. The programme has four main goals. The first goal is to help parents provide their children with the best possible model of anxiety management. The second goal is to help parents so that they can help their children become more resilient. The third goal is to work with parents in developing a plan for helping the children manage anxiety more effectively and become flexible thinkers. The final goal focuses on how parents react to their anxious child and provide strategies to deal with this. 

The parents will receive a workbook at the start of the workshop which includes the content to be covered in the sessions, as well as practical exercises which will be conducted during the sessions. The workbook aims to reinforce the material presented, in addition to being used by parents at home after the sessions have ended. 

Trained facilitators from MAPP, which is a collaboration of 18 organisations from the public, community and voluntary sector in Longford, Westmeath, Laois and Offaly, will deliver the intervention.

Currently there has been one proof-of-concept RCT of the 6-week Group Fear-less intervention, however, the efficacy of the brief Fear-less Workshop has yet to be tested. Our assignment aims to conduct the first RCT of the Fear-less Workshop.
