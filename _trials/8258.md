abstract: "The aim of this research project is twofold. First, we detect if and where anti-Semitism is present in Italy in the labor market, in the housing market, and in social activities. We use a field experimental setup in all three areas, contacting companies, landlords, and amateur football clubs. We use these three areas to gather a concise overview of the current situation. Second, we analyze if anti-Semitism today is related to the treatment of Italian Jews in Italy during the holocaust. Specifically, we want to examine if Jews today are treated differently because of the extent that cities or municipalities deported Jews during the holocaust. Italy is an especially interesting country, in contrast to numerous other European countries, as anti-Semitism and deportation were heterogeneous and extremely unevenly distributed across Italy. "
