abstract: "The Project Providing Opportunities With Education for Refugees and Jordanians (POWER-J) aims to address the growing challenge of student drop-out in lower secondary school by improving students’ socioemotional and cognitive skills and teacher’s pedagogical practices in mathematics to provide the space to practice the new socio-emotional skills. Over 200,000 school-aged Syrian refugee children live in Jordan, of which approximately 83 percent receive free education services; however, challenges with integration into the local context impede learning opportunities and contribute to high dropout and low attendance rates. 

The objective of POWER-J is to evaluate the impact of a package of interventions consisting of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and pedagogical classroom interventions on students’ cognitive and behavioral skills, and conditional on that, evaluate the effects on improving student attendance. The aim is to gather evidence on how to (1) effectively support Syrian refugees and Jordanian students to acquire cognitive, behavioral, and emotion-focused skills that will reduce distress and negative behaviors; thus, motivating them to stay in school; and, (2) how to improve instructional practices in mathematics so that students are not falling behind academically and find a conducive space to use their socio-emotional skills
