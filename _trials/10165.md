abstract: "The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 dramatically expanded the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) subsidies, but many low-income enrollees may not know that they can switch to a more generous Cost-Sharing Reduction (CSR) Silver plan with no increase in their monthly premium. During the 2022 Open Enrollment Period in California’s ACA marketplace, we tested two interventions designed to increase CSR Silver take-up among low-income households enrolled in bronze plans. The first intervention used a behaviorally-informed letter paired with three email reminders. The second intervention automatically crosswalked eligible households from bronze to $0 CSR Silver plans with the same health insurer at the beginning of the renewal period. Amid the availability of enhanced marketplace subsidies through the end of 2025, our findings inform current health policy debates on the relative effectiveness of different approaches to improve plan choice quality for low-income households.
