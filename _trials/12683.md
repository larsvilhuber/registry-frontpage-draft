abstract: "To understand scientific decision-making (a form of entrepreneurial decision-making), a reliable, standardized, and scalable measure is needed. As a part of the efforts to create a measurement for scientific decision-making, we plan to validate the items in our instrument through a “nudge” experiment. This is crucial, as the entrepreneurship field contains numerous non-validated items, posing a challenge to the integrity of our research. First and foremost, the validated measure ensures reliability that the instrument is measuring what it is meant to measure. That means that the data we collect is consistently and accurately representing the constructs being measured. Additionally, validated items provide us with accuracy and precision estimates of the true values that is essential in making informed decisions. "
