abstract: "Young women spend 50 minutes daily on social media (SM); thus, SM platforms are prom-20 ising for health interventions. This study tested the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a co-de-21 signed Instagram intervention targeting eating, physical activity, and social well-being behaviours 22 in women aged 18–24. The DHC was an assessor-blinded, two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial 23 with 50 participants over 12 weeks. Engagement was assessed via SM metrics; acceptability via post-24 program questionnaires; feasibility included retention, randomization, recruitment, and data col-25 lection. Secondary outcomes—dietary quality, physical activity, social influence, disordered eating 26 behaviours, body image, and digital health literacy—were assessed using validated surveys. Anal-27 yses included t-tests, chi-squared tests, and linear mixed models. Treatment effects were estimated 28 by testing mean score differences from baseline to 3 months for intention-to-treat populations. The 29 DHC scored 83.6% for program satisfaction. Over time, a significant decrease in body image was 30 observed (p = 0.013). A significant group-by-time interaction for digital health literacy (p = 0.002) 31 indicated increased ability to discern evidence-based nutrition information (p = 0.006). The waitlist 32 control group showed increased social influence compared to the intervention group (p = 0.034). No 33 other significant changes were observed. The DHC is a feasible and acceptable method for dissem-34 inating nutrition information. Larger studies are needed to determine efficacy."
