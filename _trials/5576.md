abstract: "The purpose of this research is to examine how people would respond to a vaccine against the Coronavirus (COVID-19) and how that in turn would affect the length and severity of the Coronavirus outbreak in the U.S.

Specifically, subjects will get information about the estimated risks of the coronavirus, as well as an estimate of how effective a coronavirus vaccine might be, and thereafter state their willingness to vaccinate themselves, or any children in their household.

Given it is unclear at this point exactly what the risks are from the coronavirus in the U.S., we will vary information about the risks across subjects, such that they will be randomized into one of 8 information treatments. In other words, each subject will only face one of the treatments. 

We foresee the project to deliver important information to policymakers on the willingness to vaccinate against the corona virus, once a vaccine has been developed. It is important to government agencies not only to ensure a vaccine is developed, but also to ensure the uptake of the vaccine is satisfactory. This project helps with the latter.
