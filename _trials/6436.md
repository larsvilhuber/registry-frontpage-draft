abstract: "Recent evidence documents that low-cost interventions aimed at giving adolescents a growth mindset have very sizable and positive effects on their test scores and probability of dropping out of school. However, such interventions are yet to be tested in poorer settings, where resources such as computers and internet are often not available. In partnership with the SÃ£o Paulo State Secretariat of Education (SEDUC-SP), in Brazil, this project adapts and evaluates the previously evaluated Growth Mindset intervention from its computer-based original format to an SMS-based format, which could be scaled in both developed and developing countries. Above and beyond comparing the computer-based and SMS-based intervention, the project investigates the mechanisms behind the impacts of the growth mindset intervention. To unbundle its message, we randomize students within the SMS intervention into treatment arms that target specifically (i) beliefs about high returns to effort, or (ii) beliefs about low costs of effort, or (iii) salience of school activities, or (iv) risk-taking, or (v) future-orientation. 866,666 students from 6th to 12th grade will participate in the study. We evaluate impacts of the different treatment arms on participation in distance learning activities during the school shutdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and on school attendance, grades and student dropouts when regular classes resume."
