abstract: "The overuse and misuse of pesticide is very serious in many developing countries, including China. Many studies have explored solutions from the perspectves of risk aversion, law forbidden, and economic incentive, but no cost-effecyive solution has been found so far. Information and knowledge are important factors affecting decision-making of pesticide use, especially the pesticide label, which is a scientifical and convenient information source for farmers to obtain acurrate and timely information. However, most farners ignore labels in reality and rely on other information providers, such as pesticide retailers or their own experience, which are not realiable. Therefore, we want to figure out why the pesticide label does not work and how to activate it again."
