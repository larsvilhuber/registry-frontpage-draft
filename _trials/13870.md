abstract: "Public buildings are a significant source of energy consumption in China and have long faced issues such as poorly managed energy systems. Improved and automated control of air conditioning systems in these buildings can effectively reduce energy waste. However, if occupant behavior is not adequately considered, it can negatively impact their acceptance of newly developed technologies, thereby hindering the achievement of energy conservation goals. By taking into account policy standards regarding air conditioning temperature requirements, we implement various energy-saving strategies and conduct randomized controlled experiments in several public buildings in China. We collect high-frequency data to analyze the impact of different energy-saving strategies on energy consumption as well as user experience. The research results can support efficient energy management and decarbonization in the building sector."
