abstract: "To achieve the goal of ensuring that over 90% of students acquire basic academic skills by the end of primary school, the Government of Morocco is revisiting its remedial education policy. This study evaluates the impact of the Teaching at the Right-Level (TaRL) approach compared to the standard remedial education program implemented by an NGO, focusing on four key outcomes.

We are conducting a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) to assess the effects of TaRL on: (i) student performance on an extended ASER test, (ii) gender dynamics during remedial education sessions, and (iii) teachers' gender stereotypes towards students, measured through an Implicit Association Test (IAT). We will also evaluate if the increase in students' learning outcomes is proportionally higher than the increase in program costs. To the best of our knowledge, the gender-related impacts of TaRL have not yet been studied in the literature, making this an important area of investigation.

By leveraging administrative data and a difference-in-difference methodology, we will examine the spillover effects of TaRL on the academic performance of non-beneficiary students. Our access to extensive administrative data enables us to use schools without a remedial education program as a control group."
