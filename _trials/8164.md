abstract: "In FY 2020-21, the Ministry of Social Welfare (as part of the Government of Bangladesh) fully digitized the disbursement of Bhata (social safety net allowance) payments to 88 million beneficiaries of the Old Age allowance, Widow allowance, and Disable allowance programs, primarily delivering payments into existing or new Mobile Financial Services (MFS) accounts. As of June 2021, all newly enrolled participants receive money digitally on mobile money accounts. While this new system has many benefits, concerns regarding beneficiariesâ€™ experience and barriers to use were identified during monitoring surveys. This study aims to test a combination of programmatic interventions designed to address the market frictions that beneficiaries face."
