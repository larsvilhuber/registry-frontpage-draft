abstract: "The agricultural sector in Indonesia faces several challenges, including food security and sustainability for a growing population, environmental degradation and climate change, improving income and living standards for smallholders and an aging workforce in the agricultural sector. Organic farming has the potential to address some of these challenges. It is more environmentally friendly than conventional farming and potentially it could increase the attractiveness of farming for the younger population if it is perceived as a new modern technology. However, the adoption of organic farming is still at a very low level in Indonesia. This research explores the effectiveness of interventions on knowledge about, attitude towards and adoption of organic farming using a randomized control trial.  The study is conducted in two provinces in Java, Indonesia enrolling a sample of 1,200 farmers. Farmers in treatment groups are exposed to alternative treatments that either offer (1) only training on organic farming practices and the marketing of organic products, (2) the same training but augmented by a video intervention that raises awareness for potential health and environmental consequences of conventional farming or (3) again the training but this time augmented by an intervention that strengthens mutual support within farmer groups with respect to a conversion towards organic farming. Interventions are randomized at the village level and not the individual level to limit the occurrence of unwanted treatment spillovers. The study aims to provide non-government institutions and policy makers with evidence on the effectiveness of training on organic farming."
