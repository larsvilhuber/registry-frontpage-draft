abstract: "This study examines the effect of different wealth levels on insurance demand for probabilistic insurance contracts. Previous research has shown that even the existence of very small default probabilities lead to a sharp decrease in individualsâ€™ willingness to pay. In addition to wealth effects, we also investigate the impact of cognitive effort and financial literacy on the demand for probabilistic insurance.  "
