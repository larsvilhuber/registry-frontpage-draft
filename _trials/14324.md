abstract: "Two main ideas motivate this line of research. First, most firms in low-income countries (LICs) have fewer than five workers independent of the specific setting or sector they are operating in. Second, these constraints appear to disproportionately affect women. International Labor Organization data shows that 81.2% of women are self-employed in sub-Saharan Africa, but Ashraf et al (2022) show that women entrepreneurs tend to run businesses that are significantly less profitable than those run by men. Understanding these patterns is central to developing policies for women’s economic inclusion. We propose to build on existing work to identify the role that market versus non-market constraints to business growth play in explaining these two phenomena."
