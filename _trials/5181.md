abstract: "This study investigates whether and how diversification in small businesses reduces the vulnerabilities to which poor entrepreneurs are exposed. We indirectly (and randomly) change the level of diversification of a group of small businesses in Brazil by increasing entrepreneurs' ability to sell through a platform. Treatment thus consists of online training sessions aimed at increasing entrepreneurs' platform-related sales and marketing capabilities. Main analyses focus on how treatment impacts platform sales and core-business sales (to grasp potential diversification effects). Other analyses consider how treatment impacts the diffusion of platform sellers within geographic regions."
