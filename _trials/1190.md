abstract: "School choice can only be an effective policy if choosers can process large amounts of information about schools to make effective choices. This study seeks to identify the impacts of different strategies of presenting consumers with information about schools on the choosers' ability to understand and use the information. We categorize school information into four domains: convenience (primarily distance from home), academics (primarily captured by academic proficiency and growth measures), safety (captured by indicators such as school suspension rates and parent perceptions of safety), and resources (captured by number of laptops or devices per student).

The study is an online experiment with 72 treatment arms arranged in a 3 x 3 x 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design. The study will ask respondents, who are screened to be low-income parents of school-aged children, to rank their top 5 among 16 hypothetical schools with detailed profiles. We will experimentally vary: 
1. the format (numbers, numbers + graphs, or numbers + icons), 
2. the source of information (objective indicators or objective + subjective indicators), 
3. the presence or absence of a reference point, namely the district-level mean value for each indicator
4. the number of attributes per domain and disclosure method (one attribute per information domain, multiple attributes per information domain, or multiple attributes with progressive disclosure via user-initiated click-through to see beyond the first attribute per domain), and 
5. the default sort order (distance or academic rating)

The experiment is conducted in one sitting. Participants are administered an online baseline survey and then randomized into one of the 72 treatment arms and given an endline survey that includes tasks to complete, such as ranking the schools and answering factual information about the schools described in the profiles. Participants cannot go back and change their responses to the baseline, but while they are completing the endline tasks they may toggle between the survey instrument and the school profile information display. The study will record response times as well as responses to survey items themselves.

The study will allow the researchers to estimate the impact of each of these factors on the way that parents actually rank schools (consistency with stated preferences, and whether the factors push parents toward favoring one domain over another), as well as their ability to comprehend the information and their overall attitudes toward the information (such as whether they found it useful).

The information will be used to inform a guide for school districts and other entities seeking to provide choice information to parents via online tools."
