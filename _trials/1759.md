abstract: "Innovations in consumer payment instruments urge charities to adapt the way they raise funds. In door-to-door fund raising, the shift in preference from giving cash to making donations by mobile phone changes the nature of the interaction between solicitor and donor. This study deals with the challenge posed to charities on how to ensure that mobile phone users participate in the fund raising drive. We investigate this in collaboration with a Danish charity.  Our 3x2 design targets respondents who have indicated a preference to give by mobile phone. The treatments differ in two dimensions: a. whether respondents are asked to state the amount they intend to give and the intensity of this pledge. b. the presence or absence of a deadline to complete the transfer.
