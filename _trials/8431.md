abstract: "In this experiment with senior deputy ministers of Pakistan, we randomize training policymakers in an “AI for Policy” workshop. The first treatment arm randomly receives a training focused on utility or benefits of AI for policymaking. The second treatment arm receives training focused on potential harms or dangers of AI. A control group received no training. Our design will elicit demand for both trainings and study the mediating channel experimentally using a book lottery in a simplified Becker-Degroot-Marschak mechanism. Using this lottery that randomly implements an earlier action to causally isolate the effect of book choice allows us to experimentally disentangle the effect of training from randomly assigned book conditional on the training’s demand. The rich administrative dataset and close collaboration with the Government of Pakistan will give us access to suit of measurements including actual policy outcomes.
