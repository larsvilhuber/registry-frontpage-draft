abstract: "We often prefer to interact with individuals who also want to interact with us. Experimental evidence shows higher cooperation  between partners who like to be matched with each other. In a stylized Public Goods Game setting, participants expect those who want to be matched with you to be more cooperative, and you act more altruistically yourself (Opitz and Schwaiger, 2022). At the same time, it remains unclear whether such preferences impact behavior in collaborative teamwork. Therefore, I investigate how knowing your partner's preferences about you affects (non-routine) teamwork."
