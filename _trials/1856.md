abstract: "52% of upper caste brahmins in India continue to practice untouchability. These group relations persist despite castes living in close proximity (albeit in segregated villages). Integration may be a natural policy response, though (a) little is known about how effectively contact can reduce prejudice; and (b) even less is known about how the type of contact might mediate effects, despite Allport's (1954) famous hypothesis being that contact should work only if certain conditions are met. This field experiment then tests an integrative program in rural India, within which participants are randomised to different conditions, intended to affect the "type" of contact. To do this, I use different incentive structures: half the participants are paid monetary incentives that encourage competition, whilst the rest get incentives that encourage collaboration. The full design allows me to distinguish between the effects of program participation, exposure to other castes, incentives, and the interaction between incentives and exposure (a test of whether the type of contact mediates its effects)."
