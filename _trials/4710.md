abstract: "This is a Pre Analysis Plan (PAP) for the replication of a field study conducted in April 2019, the analysis of which was pre-registered under the title ``On the motivational power of pride: a field study with participants in a road--running event''.

The purpose of the study is to investigate runners' motivation to perform at their best during a running race, as well as the pride they derive from their achievement.  Of particular interest to us is the motivation that emerges from perceived threats to one's (self or social) image, triggered by others' assessments: the desire to prove others wrong pushing people to go beyond others' (and possibly, their own) expectations.

In this PAP, we document the main results of our first study as well as the changes in the replication study pertaining to the (1) experimental design, (2) survey questions and (3) empirical analysis. We also detail how we plan to combine the analysis of the two studies."
