abstract: "Business safety inspections (BSIs) are one of the most commonly cited barriers to doing business. Costs imposed by BSIs include uncertainty about the requirements to obtain a certificate (caused by the discretion in the application of the regulation), long waiting times (both for inspections and the associated administrative process) and leakage. In this trial we assess the effects of introducing electronic inspections on outcomes related to inspector productivity. We measure impact on inspector productivity (measured by the average duration of inspections and number of inspections per day), inspection process efficiency (measured as time to process paperwork from application to obtaining the certificate), and standardization and discretion (measured by variation in compliance rates at the item- and section-levels between paper and electronic forms)."
