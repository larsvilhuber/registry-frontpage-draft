abstract: "Electricity retailers must ensure that system demand is less than or equal to available generation capacity at all times. One way for the sector to achieve this outcome is through demand-side management actions that incentivize or require consumers to reduce electricity demand during peak times. In partnership with a large electricity retailer, we randomly offered residential electricity customers one of several treatments composed of combinations of smart home electricity management equipment and financial incentives for reducing their demand.. About 1100 households were ultimately enrolled in the experiment across all of the treatments. Our objectives are to evaluate: (1) the relative take-up rates and characteristics of consumers that accept offers for each treatment based on take-up incentives and customer demographic characteristics; (2) the average treatment effect on the treated in terms of (a) electricity demand reduced during peak load hours and (b) the reliability of the amount of electricity demand reduced, for those who accept; and (3) intent-to-treat estimates for each offer as a program, using (a) and (b). We also plan to estimate heterogenous treatment effects along a number of household characteristics from each intervention. "
