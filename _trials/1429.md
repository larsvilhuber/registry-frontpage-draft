abstract: "A field experiment assessed the effects of a nonpartisan voter mobilization drive. On the weekend
before the 1998 general election, voters in the treatment group received an 8" x 11" card on which
was printed a nonpartisan encouragement to vote. This treatment had no effect on the turnout rates
of registered Republicans and Democrats, but it increased the turnout of those voters unaffiliated
with a major party. We find that the treatment was particularly effective at increasing voting among those unaffiliated voters who voted in 1996. "
