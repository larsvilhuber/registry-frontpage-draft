abstract: "This document describes the analysis plan to validate measures of executive control, self-efficacy, temporal
discounting, and risk preferences for use among adults from an informal urban settlement of Nairobi, Kenya.
511 respondents completed a battery of psychological inventories and behavioral tasks in a lab setting. Of these,
93 did so twice, with a delay of one week. We will assess construct validity by exploring relationships between
different instruments; test-retest reliability by comparing outcomes over time; and acceptability through various
checks on participant comprehension, consistency of answers, and distributions of scores. This plan outlines the
design of the instruments, psychometric and econometric methods for analysis, and criteria for continued use."
