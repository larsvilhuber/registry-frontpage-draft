abstract: "This intervention seeks to measure the effects of parental tutoring at home compared to traditional teaching in the class at school. The experiment will evaluate the effects of an intervention in economics education in grade 9 and 10 of Flemish secondary schools in Belgium. The study will measure knowledge, attitudes and behaviour of students, parents and teachers. In particular, it will assess economic and political knowledge, financial literacy, political preferences on economic issues, trust in institutions as well as family communication. Randomisation will be done at school level. The expected sample size is 60 schools with 2,400 participating students."
