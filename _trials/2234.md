abstract: "This experiment is designed with the intent of increasing the proportion of students at a regional public university taking a full course load (five courses per semester) rather than a partial course load (four or fewer courses per semester). Partial course loads are partially responsible for a high proportion of students at the university taking more than four years to complete their degree. In the intervention, students are provided with different forms of encouragement to take a full course load. Different college orientation groups are randomly assigned to receive (1) no encouragement, (2) encouragement to take a full course load with no reasoning, (3) encouragement with financial reasoning, (4) encouragement with social-normalizing reasoning, and (5) encouragement with both financial and social-normalizing reasoning. We then observe course-taking and persistence behavior in the following years."
