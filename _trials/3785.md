abstract: "Conflict between groups of humans is as old as mankind. Millions of people have perished as a result of inter-group violence over the course of history, and continuous conflict has arguably shaped human behaviors and forms of collaboration. Milder forms of outgroup discrimination and in-group bias, such as xenophobia and agitation against immigrants, increasingly dominate modern-day politics in developed countries. What drives people to hate others who are different from themselves? We propose to examine a longstanding hypothesis: whether poverty and corresponding economic distress has a causal effect on out-group discrimination and xenophobia. We conduct experiments amongst respondents with low socio-economic status. We will randomly transfer funds that are sufficient to improve the economic condition of study participants, and examine their attitudes towards ‘others’ – comparing responses with other participants who are equally poor, but did not receive an income transfer. Hence, in contrast to previous work, our approach exogenously manipulates actual economic distress and thereby allows us to measure its causal impact on xenophobic attitudes and behavior. Moreover, our study design will reveal whether targeted income transfers are an effective tool in reducing hatred of foreigners and will allow us to illuminate different psychological mechanisms that shape the relation between poverty and out-group bias
