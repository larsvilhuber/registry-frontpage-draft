abstract: "We conduct a natural field experiment with a major European party to test whether
giving party supporters more voice increases their engagement in the party’s electoral
campaign. In the experiment, the party asked a random subset of supporters for their
opinions on the importance of different topics. Giving supporters opportunities to voice
their opinions increases their engagement in the campaign as measured using behavioral
data from the party’s smartphone application. Survey data reveals that giving voice also
increases other margins of campaign effort as well as perceived voice. Our evidence
highlights the importance of voice for increasing political engagement."
