abstract: "This project uses a field experiment to measure the causal impact of a low-cost digital training program for micro-entrepreneurs in Guatemalaâ€™s food retail sector on business knowledge, business practices, profitability, and empowerment.  The experiment tests for the potential mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of digital training, including educational attainment, gender, and previous business experience."
