abstract: "Low-income women are over five times more likely than affluent women to experience an unintended pregnancy, and this pregnancy can seriously hinder their ability to improve their economic situation, given that unplanned childbearing is associated with higher rates of poverty, less family stability, and worse outcomes for children (Reeves & Venator, 2015). Pregnancy can also increase a womanâ€™s risk of homelessness, and pregnant women face greater health risks while unstably housed (Clark et al., 2019). While many individuals face housing insecurity, pregnancy creates an additional barrier to the climb out of poverty and toward a path of self-sufficiency. In response to this dilemma, there are over 450 maternity housing programs that exist to serve and support pregnant women (Peterson, 2020). These homes are residential-focused programs that often offer wrap-around support for residents, such as access to prenatal care, social support, mental health treatment, substance abuse treatment, life skills and employment training, support towards goal achievement, and parenting classes. There is little evidence about how effective these programs are at improving immediate or longer-term outcomes for mothers and their babies. Researchers are collaborating with five maternity homes to use a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of their services on mother and child health, housing, and self-sufficiency outcomes."
