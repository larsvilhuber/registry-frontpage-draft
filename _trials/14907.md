abstract: "In this study, we experimentally investigate the cause of underpricing and underperformance in the IPO market. Two well-known anomalies of IPOs are high first-day　returns and subsequent long-term underperformance. To address this issue, we investigate the IPO market model of Ljungqvist et al. (2006) in the laboratory. In this model, a　fraction of sentiment traders enter the market in each period. They irrationally believe that the IPO price is higher than the fundamental value. Other traders forecast IPO prices rationally, i.e., they know the probability P that the IPO price will fall to the fundamental value. The issuing company and an underwriter take the behavior of these traders into account. The underwriter decides in each period how many shares to sell in the IPO market. Ljungqvist et al. (2006) show that underpricing and underperformance occur even when the underwriter has no bargaining power and the firm can set the price as high as the IPO market price under a certain condition. In our pilot experiment, the firm exogenously sells the stock to subjects playing the role of the underwriter. The behavior of rational and sentimental investors is exogenously determined by the computer according to the theory. We have two treatment variables, the probability P that the IPO price will fall to the fundamental value and the number of initial shares Q. The higher P, the more likely it seems that underpricing will occur. However, this is not the case in our pilot experiment. Rather, underpricing is more likely to occur when P is large. The higher P is, the more risk-averse subjects (underwriters) might be expected to sell the shares in earlier periods. However, the subjects (underwriters) are more likely to sell the stock in later periods when P is large in order to keep the price high and preserve enough revenue in the earlier period. We found that the observed behavior maximizes the subjects'(underwriter's) profit.
