abstract: "A substantial literature shows that U.S. early childhood interventions have significant long-term economic benefits. There is little evidence on this question for developing countries. We report substantial effects on the earnings of participants in a randomized intervention conducted from 1987 - 1989 that gave psychosocial stimulation to growth-stunted Jamaican toddlers. The intervention consisted of weekly visits from community health workers over a 2-year period that taught parenting skills and encouraged mothers and children to interact in ways that develop cognitive and socio-emotional skills. The authors re-interviewed 105 out of 129 study participants 20 years later and found that the intervention increased earnings by 25%, enough for them to catch up to the earnings of a non-stunted comparison group identified at baseline (65 out of 84 participants)."
