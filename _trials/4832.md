abstract: "Using a correspondence test, we aim to study how the call-back rate when applying for low-skilled jobs (elementary occupations according to the international standard classification of occupations) is affected by experience in other low-skilled jobs and from training in host country language, more specifically having finished the Swedish For Immigrants (SFI) program, for Middle-Eastern immigrants who recently arrived in Sweden and who have a very weak attachment to the labor market."
