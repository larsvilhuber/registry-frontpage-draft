abstract: "Much decision making is decision making on behalf of others, and it is not and there are competing theories of how such decisions should be made. When making decisions on behalf of others, it might also be that the decision maker will never learn the outcomes of the decision only with delay, or possibly not at all. We explore how decisions on behalf of others is made in a setting where the revelation of uncertainty is either immediate, delayed, or it will never happen. Data from a large scale online experiment is analyzed within hierarchical Bayesian model of rank-dependent utility. "
