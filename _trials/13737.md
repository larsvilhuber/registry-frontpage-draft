abstract: "This study seeks to advance our understanding of the general public's overall assessment of — and specifically acceptance of and intention to use – electronic health records (hereafter EHR) in Germany, Italy and the UK, as well as possibly the Netherlands (i.e., what in German is mostly known as the "elektronische Patientenakte", in Italian as the "Fascicolo Sanitario Elettronico" and in English is also known as an electronic medical record).  The introduction of this digital health technology holds enormous promise for improvements in individual medical care and population health, including possibly significant cost savings, but take-up of EHRs and similar digital health technologies has been much weaker than public health and medical experts had hoped – in Europe (see, e.g. Albrecht 2016; Albrecht et al 2017; Dahlhausen et al 2022) and beyond (e.g., Dhagarra et al 2020).

We examine patients/citizens' attitudes towards EHRs through the use of an online survey experiment with three alternative information treatments.  The survey context allows us to control for (or examine as correlates or in heterogeneity analyses) a variety of pre-treatment factors (health status; experience with, and general attitudes towards, digital goods and services; trust in science, scientists and public authorities; political-ideological preferences; and various demographics) that might be drivers of preferences and acceptance, as well as post-treatment possible broader effects on health policy preferences (including regarding the desirability of various digital health tools (such as digital therapeutics) and interest in using specific features or types of digital health technologies."
