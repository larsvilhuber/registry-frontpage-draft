abstract: "Group identity has emerged as a key explanatory variable of social exclusion or economic inequality because people prefer to benefit others who are similar to them (in-group favoritism) over those belonging to a different social group. If group identification were fixed, individuals belonging to disadvantaged groups would be unable to escape them. However, constructivist research has shown that identities are constructed and can change as the product of human decision making. In this paper I study the extent to which the choice over their group identity can help individuals break free from inefficient dynamics. Particularly, I look at group identity choices in a social network setting where interactions with others (both in-group and out-groups) are strategically interdependent. I provide a theoretical model and characterize equilibrium outcomes when group identities can be changed. I also test the role of group identity in different settings through laboratory experiments."
