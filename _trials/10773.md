abstract: "There is increasing recognition among economists that human beings care about their relative place in society, not just their material welfare, and that subjective welfare has a real material cost. This study investigates two questions central to the welfare cost of relative rank considerations: (1) are individuals judged to be of a lower rank more likely to be victimized by those who judge themselves to be of higher rank and, if yes, what form does this victimization take; and (2) do individuals of lower rank distort their behavior in order to appear of higher rank than they actually are and, if yes, does this affect their consumption pattern or their engagement with welfare programs targeting the poor. The study population is recruited among urban and peri-urban dwellers of a large African city."
