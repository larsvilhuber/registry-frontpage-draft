abstract: "This study complements with an online experiment the results from "Persuasion and Gender: Experimental Evidence from Two Political Campaigns", IZA Discussion Paper No. 9906, by two of the PIs (Tommaso Nannicini and Vincenzo Galasso). The existing working paper  investigates the differential response of male and female voters to competitive persuasion in political campaigns with a survey experiment during the electoral race for mayor in Milan (2011), and a field experiment during the electoral race for mayor in Cava de’ Tirreni (2015). In both cases, a sample of eligible voters was randomly divided into three groups. Two were exposed to either a positive or a negative campaign by one of the opponents. The third—control—group received no electoral information. In Milan, the campaigns were administered online and consisted of a bundle of advertising tools (videos, texts, slogans). In Cava de’ Tirreni, we implemented a large scale door-to-door campaign in collaboration with one of the candidates, randomizing positive vs. negative messages. In both experiments, stark gender differences emerge. Females vote more for the opponent and less for the incumbent when they are exposed to the opponent’s positive campaign. Exactly the opposite occurs for males. These gender differences cannot be accounted for by gender identification with the candidate, ideology, or other observable attributes of the voters. The proposed study aims at uncovering the underlying mechanism behind this puzzling result with the use of an online experiment. In particular, we plan to expose participants to a fictitious mayoral race to either a positve or negative campaign video message by one of the opponents and to measure with state-of-the-art elicitation methods from experimental economics the participants' degree of risk aversion, competitiveness, overconfidence and cooperation. The goal is to replicate the differential response to positive vs. negative messages between men and women and to investigate whether this heterogeneous treatment effect can be accounted for by gender differences in individual behavioral traits."
