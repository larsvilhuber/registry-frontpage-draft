abstract: "This project aims to understand the price elasticity of demand for a parametric rainfall insurance product offered by Axinan Pte Ltd (brand name “Igloo”) among rice farmers in Vietnam. Besides, the effects of this insurance on rice farmers’ behavior, such as their agricultural investments, their awareness of climate change, and other outcomes, are analyzed. For this purpose, we offer randomly selected participants of the Vietnam Rice Farmer Panel Survey vouchers to purchase rainfall insurance at discounted prices ranging from 10% to 90% of the market price just before the intervention.
