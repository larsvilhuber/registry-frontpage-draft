abstract: "There is wide agreement regarding the importance of (broadly defined) family characteristics for children and youth's behavior, with a strong emphasis in what regards to academic achievement, but there are few papers that have studied the mechanisms that support this relation. This study aims to test one of the potencial mechanisms, parental involvement, through the impact evaluation of a program in Chile (Programa Aprender en Familia). The program aims to increase parental involvement by focusing in the school, by working out norms and attitudes toward a better relation with the families, and in parents, through teaching sessions with the aim of improving parenting skills. The experimental evaluation design will allow us to isolate the causal effect of the program on parental involvement and children's cognitive and non-cognitive skills. "
