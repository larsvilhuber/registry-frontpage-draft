abstract: "We use an online experiment to study how a team's gender composition affects team communication, team output, and preferences for further teamwork. In the first stage of the experiment, randomly composed teams of four meet in an online chat room and work on a series of complex single choice problems under a team piece rate. Team members can communicate via a group audio chat while working on the task. The teams' gender composition varies between all-male, all-female, and mixed (two females and two males). In the second stage of the experiment, each subject meets another subject from a different first-stage team in an online chat room for a short period of time. Subjects then individually state their preference for working on the task individually, or in a team with the other subject. We also elicit the subjects' beliefs about the productivity of individual work and teamwork, and beliefs about team communication. Using digitized data on team communication from the first stage, we ask how a team's gender composition affects team communication, and whether differences in communication translate into differences in team output. Exploiting choice data and beliefs from the second stage, we explore how being assigned to either a gender-diverse or a gender-homogenous team in the first stage affects subjects' beliefs about and preferences for teamwork."
