abstract: "We have formed a research partnership with Shahi Exports Pvt. Ltd, one of the largest garment manufacturers in India, wherein the firm plans to implement a worker voice tool in its two factory units. This tool aims to make it easier for workers to register any complaints that they might have at the workplace. This is a pilot study, lasting 6 months, by which the firm wishes to understand the productivity, retention, and job satisfaction consequences of this change by randomly giving half of the workers access to use this new technology. It also wants to explore interventions that will lead to an improved usage of such a technology. For the latter, we have proposed a short training on the benefit and scope of the tool and regular reminders (via SMS) encouraging the workers to use the tool. We will do an impact evaluation of introducing such worker voice tool on workplace outcomes (productivity, retention, attendance), worker engagement, general mental health (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale) and job satisfaction outcomes. Workers who donâ€™t own a phone/smart phone will also be a part of the study and can use the phone line though a phone belonging to friends or family. "
