abstract: "The human ability to establish cooperation depends upon the execution of cooperative norms, especially in large groups of unrelated strangers. High levels of cooperation among humans are often attributed to the possibility of third-party punishment (TPP). We study the effectiveness of TPP to increase cooperative behavior in a large-scale cooperation game in a representative sample of the German population. Our study aims to answer whether TPP fosters cooperation in a prisonerâ€™s dilemma (PD) game in society at large."
