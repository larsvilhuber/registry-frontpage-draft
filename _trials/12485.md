abstract: "Underweight is a serious health issue among young Japanese women. It has a serious impact on their own health and the health of future generations. One of the causes of underweight among Japanese women is dietary restriction due to the social norm that 'women should be thin'. This study examines whether correcting the expectation of these social norm will reduce womenâ€™s willingness to be thin and excessive dietary restriction."
