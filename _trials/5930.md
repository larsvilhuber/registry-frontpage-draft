abstract: "In France, the Active Solidarity Allowance (Revenu de solidarité active/ Rsa) is the main minimum income scheme since 2008. Although it has been modified in 2016, its core features remain a minimum allowance for people with no revenue (Approx € 550/month for a single person), and a supplement to labour income aiming at reducing disincentives to job search by lowering the marginal tax rate to 62\% instead of 100%. In theory, beneficiaries should be provided with personalized support by social workers which take the form of a signed personalized «return to employment» plan or «social reintegration» contract. The nature, intensity and content of these contracts vary a lot between localities and depend on the beneficiaries situation, needs and project, but it is an obligation. Non-participation may lead to reductions or suspension of benefits.

We are interested in assessing the impacts of a pilot welfare-to-work program implemented in France from 2017 to 2021: Reliance, targeting single-parents who have been on welfare for more than 2 years in the urban are of Nancy, in the North-East of France.
The general objective of the project is to set up an action to reintegrate into employment a population that is permanently anchored in the Active Solidarity Income, with very low prospects of returning to work, real or perceived, given their responsibility as single parents.
It concerns a target public residing in the Nancy metropolitan area, an urban and dense territory with public transport and a network of diversified local services such as childcare.
This program is very different from the usual social support provided to Rsa-beneficiaries. it involves 3 social worker working full time for approximately 100 beneficiaries, which is about 10 times smaller than the usual amount of beneficiaries per social worker.
Our research designed is an encouragement design where half of our sample is invited to participate to Reliance while the other is left as a control group and does not know it is being observed in administrative data. The pilot include 3 cohorts (2018-2020).
The data comes from administrative registries of family benefit allowance and surveys collected 2 years after the end of the program.
