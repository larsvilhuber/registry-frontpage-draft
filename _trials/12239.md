abstract: "More and more countries are introducing life skills and financial education into their curricula to teach students to become responsible, competent, and productive citizens. This research evaluate the effects of integrating life skills and financial education into the curriculum of schools in The Gambia. This study's two main focal points are to investigate the influence of the new curriculum and the effects of two different intensities of teacher training on the translation of the newly infused skills to the students. The study employs a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, incorporating two treatment arms with varying intensity levels. The research will be conducted across 90 schools in regions 3 and 4 of The Gambia, reaching 450 teachers and 2,700 students. The selected schools will be randomized into three groups: a high-intensity teacher professional development group, a low-intensity teacher professional development group, and a control group that follows the conventional curriculum. If successful, this study will contribute to the roll-out of the curriculum nationally starting in 2024."
