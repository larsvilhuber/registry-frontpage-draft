abstract: "In many countries, female participation in the labor market remains strikingly low, challenging women's empowerment and limiting their role in major household decisions. One possible impediment to women's participation in the workforce lies in the misperception of their own real power and the prevailing belief that power is not necessarily achieved through employment. Asymmetries in beliefs among married men and women lead to differences in economic outcomes in a self-fulfilling way, limiting women's working aspirations. Our study aims to test whether information provision can be effective in altering women's attitudes toward their work outside the home. The analysis runs on separate samples of married men and women in Lebanon. We use an information treatment based on men's opinions to address information frictions, designed to correct women's perceptions of their own power. We explore how adjusting these perceptions influences women's preferences for work and their beliefs about what factors affect empowerment.
