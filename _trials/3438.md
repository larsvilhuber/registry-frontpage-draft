abstract: "Preferences and beliefs vary systematically across space, gender, and age. In the context of non-competitive choice under risk, men take on more risk than women. Researchers have shown biological characteristics help explain this fact. Cultural factors may additionally contribute to an explanation, whether consistent with expected utility theory or not. Other characteristics that correlate with gender are a third potential explanation.

This project builds on identity theory to derive a set of predictions that constitute a theory of choice under risk. Identity theory posits that individuals commit to several role identities, each prescribing norms of behavior that are common knowledge in society. Individuals conform their choices to these norms of behavior to verify their identity. Verifying a role-based identity ``means engaging in the behavioral requirements of the role, that is, enacting behavior consistent with the role'' (Burke, 1991). Identity verification increases individuals' (self-)utility, whereas incongruence to one's identity reduces (self-)utility. In this setting, maintaining self-views involves trading off costs and benefits. In the context of gender identity, male identity verification affects men's utility more than female identity verification affects women's utility, because ``manhood, in contrast to womenhood, is seen as a precarious state requiring continual social proof and validation" (Vadello et al., 2008). 

Individuals commit to several identities based on their societal roles, but they conform to the norms prescribed by their role identity that is most salient based on the situation or decision frame. Thus a basic prediction of identity theory for choice under risk is that men whose male identity is salient should make riskier choices, because male identity prescribes risky and aggressive norms of behavior. Moreover, this framework supports both conformity and overcompensation in choice -- men should take on more risk not only when their identity is primed, but also when it is threatened, because in both cases, conforming to male-identity norms allows identity verification.

Identity theory also has a set of unique predictions on choice under risk. First, the effects of identity salience on decision-making should involve a beliefs channel -- motivated beliefs arise to allow men taking more risk than would otherwise be warranted based on their risk preferences and known objective probability of success in risky outcomes. Second, any identity that prescribes the same normative behaviors as male identity should affect decisions under risk similarly as male identity. Third, identity should affect choice under risk similarly for positive and negative net present value (NPV) risky opportunities, which might contribute to explain why risk averse agent invest in negative NPV projects. Fourth, identity should affect direct and delegated choices under risk similarly. Finally, the effects of identity on choice should vary with the commitment of individuals to social identity and its norms. Systematic variation in commitment to identity across space and cohorts should therefore predict the size of the effect of the same identity shock on choice under risk of different individuals.
