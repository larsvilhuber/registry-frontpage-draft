abstract: "This study involves a brief survey followed by a randomized control experiment involving students on University of Toronto Campuses. The topic of investigation is the willingness to pay for the menstrual cup, a reusable menstrual cup and sustainable alternative to common disposables such as tampons and sanitary napkins. We use informational interventions including education on the private benefits of using the menstrual cup (cost and convenience) or environmental benefits of using the menstrual cup (waste and energy savings) to determine if there is correlation between the intervention received and subsequent willingness to pay. Our aim is to assess the treatment effects of each intervention as well as the potential heterogeneity in treatment effects between individuals who are familiar with others who use the menstrual cup, and self-reported rankings of how important 'sustainability' or 'cost-savings' is in their own purchasing decisions."
