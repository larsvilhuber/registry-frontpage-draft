abstract: "This study seeks to determine the efficacy of different academic integrity messages for reducing cheating. We will rigorously test different academic integrity messaging designed for saliency and delivered at key times in the course. Compared to the current status quo of ad hoc messaging by professors, this study aims to create practical guidance for faculty."
