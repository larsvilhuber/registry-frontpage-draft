abstract: "We study how teachers' limited cognitive capacity affects the track recommendations for their students. In particular, we run an experiment with teachers in which they are shown a series of hypothetical students' profiles, and they are asked to provide a track recommendation to each student. We explore whether limited cognitive capacity - either through limited memory or higher cognitive load - leads teachers to assign more gender-stereotypical recommendations to students. "
