abstract: "Can a low-capacity government facing information constraints about the quality of its workers raise revenue by optimizing the composition of tax collector teams? In the context of a large property tax collection campaign in DRC, this paper experimentally compares three assignment policies: random matching, positive assortative matching, and choice-based matching. Random matching pairs up tax collectors randomly. Positive assortative matching (PAM) estimates collector types using available data and then pairs high (low) types together. Choice-based matching pairs collectors based on their elicited preferences. We examine the impact of these three assignment policies on tax collection performance and taxpayer attitudes."
