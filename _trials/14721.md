abstract: "Improving pregnant women and newborn babies’ health care services in resource-poor settings, particularly in remote communities in many developed countries and in most developing countries, remains an important challenge. We implement a technology-assisted healthcare intervention focusing on pregnant women in rural Bangladesh. The technology involves a simple phone-based automated calling system, called interactive voice response (IVR), through which we offer telehealth support to women from their first/second trimesters of pregnancy. The telehealth support enabled participants to are born. We examine women’s health-seeking behavior during the antenatal and post-natal period and its impact on maternal and child physical and mental healthinteract with the message system using the keypad of their mobile phones. In a separate treatment arm, these women are able to directly contact a doctor to discuss their health and the health of their babies once they are born. We examine women’s health-seeking behavior during the antenatal and post-natal period and its impact on maternal and child physical and mental health."
