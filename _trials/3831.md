abstract: "While a large body of research has documented the existence of hiring discrimination, the extant research has had less to say about potential remedies to reduce such discrimination. In this project, we ask: how might customer communication regarding a business's lack of personnel diversity impact hiring practices? To address this question, we will conduct an experimental audit study of restaurants who are soliciting job applications. We will prime these employers with an electronic message from a customer and then send the employer job applications -- varying the race of the job applicant -- to assess hiring decisions."
