abstract: "Use of solid fuels for cooking is one of the significant contributors to household air pollution. Our research investigates the constraints households face in switching from solid fuels to Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG), a cleaner fuel. We provide information on the adverse health effects of solid fuel use to randomly selected households and estimate the impact of this information campaign on the take-up and utilization of LPG. In a separate treatment arm, we provide information on the subsidy-corrected price of LPG refill cylinders in addition to the health benefits of using LPG. Switching to cleaner fuels can make a significant difference in health outcomes, particularly respiratory disorders, among women and children by reducing exposure to household air pollution. Additionally, it may empower women by reducing their time spent in collecting firewood and cooking using inefficient fuels. We explore the effects of health and financial information on using LPG on health expenditure, women's gender relations, time-use, and labor market outcomes. "
