abstract: "This study experimentally examines how default settings influence individuals’ decision to share their personal information, such as the COVID-19 infection experiences and behavioral history, in the wake of a future pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, scientific technologies for contact tracing were introduced to accurately identify signs of the spread of infection and take immediate actions. However, in many countries, the rate at which people accepted the technology and shared information about their infections and social contacts was low. For example, individuals were required to download a contact tracing application in order to accept the technology, and such the procedure possibly determined the rate. On the other hand, it has been discussed that, in order to increase the rate of information sharing, it is necessary to adopt a method in which information about people's infections and contacts is tracked by default and they are allowed to exit from the tracked condition through an additional procedure. In this study, we label the former as “pre-opt-in” and the latter as “post-opt-out.” This study creates the conditions of pre-opt-in and post-opt-out on an online survey. We ask those recently infected with COVID-19 questions about date of infection, vaccination status, heath status, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, height and weight, symptoms, and social contacts. However, since this is private information, respondents can choose not to provide it (the attendance fee does not change if they choose not to provide it). In the pre-opt-in condition, respondents are asked if they are willing to answer these questions before the questions are displayed. In the post-opt-out condition, respondents are asked if they are willing to provide response data for these questions after they have answered these questions. Using a randomized controlled trial, we evaluate how the difference between the pre-opt-in and post-opt-out conditions affects the rate of information sharing and the distribution of shared information."
