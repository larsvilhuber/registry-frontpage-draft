abstract: "One of the most  popular explanations for youth unemployment is skill mismatch, especially in a labor market that continually evolves in response to technological changes. Providing young people with the right employability skills through training is thus seen as a major policy priority.  This project aims to investigate whether rapid coding courses (coding bootcamps) can equip disadvantaged young workers with the skills needed to succeed in the labor market. Specifically, we will conduct a randomized control trial (RCT) to evaluate the causal effects of a coding bootcamp among a sample of disadvantaged young beneficiaries in Brazil. To do so, we have partnered with an NGO that offers high-quality coding bootcamps worldwide. Through 2023 and 2024, we will randomly offer applicants a spot in their oversubscribed course in Brazil."
