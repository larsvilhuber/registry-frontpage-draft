abstract: "As the world's largest carbon emissioner, China has set a "Dual Carbon” Goal，which is to reach carbon peak by 2030 and carbon neutral by 2060. To achieve this goal, reduce electricity use from residential buildings are needed. Previous literature find setting an electricity use reduction goal is effective. This study will further explore if public goal setting is more effective relative to the private goal setting. In addition, we will explore the gender difference in goal setting. "
