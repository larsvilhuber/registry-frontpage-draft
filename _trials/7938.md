abstract: "This project attempts to improve our understanding of descriptive social norm interventions (i.e., interventions which aim to change behavior by altering individual beliefs about the prevalence of a given activity). We do this by conducting a field experiment in conjunction with a non-profit health organization. In the experiment, participants are first asked what share of survey recipients have signed up to become ‘advocates’ for the organization. They are then matched into different groups and given different signals about the share who have signed up (these signals range from 0% to 100% in 20% intervals). Finally, participants are asked about their posterior beliefs about sign-up rates as well as whether they would themselves like to sign up as advocates. This design allows us to study how exactly signals influence behavior, whether they do so purely by updating beliefs, and the effect of sending very low signal values."
