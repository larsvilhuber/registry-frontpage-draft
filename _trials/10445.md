abstract: "Teenage pregnancy is a persistent problem both in developed and developing countries. Besides its adverse effects on mother and child health, its occurrence hinders educational achievement and upward economic mobility as teenagers may choose to drop school. While there is evidence on the effect of increased sexual education on adolescent attitudes, condom use, or sexual initiation, there is little evidence to inform policies oriented toward addressing the problem in rural and indigenous populations. We evaluate two different approaches to delivering sexual education in rural Peru. First, training and empowering school teachers to incorporate and provide sexual education in the school. Second, we evaluate an alternative approach that brings professional on-demand counseling about health and sex for students. "
