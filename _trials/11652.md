abstract: "Rent control is a price regulation to make housing more affordable for low-income tenants and is especially prominent in expensive cities.  Economic theory and empirical evidence suggest that rent control may lead to undesirable economic outcomes. Most notably, rent control may reduce the quantity supplied of rental housing and beneficiaries of the controlled price may include a significant number of high-income households. Even so, rent control continues to be a popular policy tool among politicians and activists and the public debate is far from settled. We will employ a randomized control trial to ask the following question regarding rent control policy: Does learning about the economic impacts of rent control on the quantity of housing supplied and the distribution of benefits of the policy affect the political commitment of individuals towards the regulation? We will explore the moral reasons why some people support and others oppose rent control as part of public policy and ask if better information on the empirically plausible consequences of rent control influences the extent of political commitment to the policy."
