abstract: "We created a pedagogical intervention designed to give students a more active role in the learning of geometry â€“one of three units of the seventh grade curriculum or about three months of teaching. A key aspect of this change relies on providing them with guided opportunities to explore and discover.  In mathematics, a potentially important lever in this process is the use of technology. Our experiment explores a gradient of technologies that could complement this pedagogical approach. We randomly assigned the 85 participating schools to one of five conditions: (1) status-quo (i.e., control); (2) active learning; (3) active learning and an interactive whiteboard; (4) active learning and a computer lab; (5) active learning and a laptop for every child in the classroom. All students (18,000) and teachers (190) in the seventh grade of these schools participated in the experiment.
