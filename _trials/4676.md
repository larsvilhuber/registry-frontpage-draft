abstract: "Do intrinsic motivations matter more than extrinsic rewards for teacher's school choice? In this paper, we answer this question by presenting the results of a novel low-cost, large-scale intervention put in place in Peru to reduce teacher sorting (e.g., good teachers choosing the best schools). Following the experimental and theoretical literature on internal versus external rewards in decision-making, we designed an implemented a package of interventions to prime (a) intrinsic motivations (e.g., satisfaction for having high social impact in a disadvantaged school) or (b) extrinsic motivations (e.g., receiving a monetary reward for choosing a disadvantaged school) on prospective teachers, just before they have to choose the set of schools where they would prefer to be allocated. We implemented our intervention through two channels: the online platform they use to apply for schools and text messages. We analyze the effect on their likelihood of choosing disadvantaged schools.
