abstract: "Inequality is often inherited: individuals are not involved in the process that generates inequality, yet end up with different amounts of resources or opportunities based solely on relations to other people. We conduct an online experiment with a broadly representative sample of the US population to study individuals’ redistributive preferences in situations featuring inherited inequality and how they relate to preferences over real world policies.
Details presented in the pre-analysis plan."
