abstract: "Both the awareness and the adoption of free public health care services through mobile phones are very low in rural Bangladesh where the need for such services should be higher due to lack of access to qualified health care professionals in those areas. To study how awareness and adoption of these services can be improved and how that would affect health behaviors, I conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial among 4,500 households in 900 neighborhoods (paras) in rural Bangladesh. This RCT has three treatments: (1) the households in the first treatment receive a flyer/leaflet containing information about these services, (2) the households in the second treatment receive the same flyer/leaflet and are encouraged to save these phone numbers in their phone, and (3) the households in the third treatment receive the same flyer/leaflet and are encouraged to save these phone numbers in their phone and to make a call to experience how the service works.
