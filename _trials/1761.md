abstract: "MDRC launched the Performance-Based Scholarship Demonstration in 2008 to test an innovative strategy for addressing two policy objectives: increasing the financial support available to low-income students, and creating an incentive for such students to complete their courses and make more timely progress toward degrees. The idea is to provide a supplement to existing federal and state financial aid that is contingent on enrolling in a minimum number of credit hours and making passing grades. The performance-based scholarships are paid directly to students (rather than to the colleges or universities they attend) in order to reward students for their progress and to allow them to make choices of how best to support their schooling. For some, this may mean buying books or paying for transportation to campus; for others, it may mean cutting back on work hours or hiring a babysitter for their children during finals week.

MDRC tested variations of the performance-based scholarship at eight colleges and one intermediary across six states. The program at each college was targeted to low-income students with high unmet need, based on the cost of attendance and gaps in state financial aid. 
The Performance-Based Scholarship Demonstration was designed to produce rigorous evidence of the programs' impacts and to answer policy-relevant questions:

-- Do performance-based scholarships increase short- or long-term academic achievement?
-- How does variation in the amount and duration of scholarships affect academic outcomes? For example, how do the impacts of a $1,000 scholarship compare with those of a $2,000 scholarship?
-- For what target population do the scholarships have the greatest impacts?
-- What are the effects of bundling the scholarships with enhanced student services, such as advising and tutoring?

The results show that these scholarships improved students' academic progress during the program--effects that remained evident several years after the program ended. The effects on students' academic progress appear generally consistent across the different programs and student subgroups. In addition, one program targeted high school seniors and succeeded in increasing their matriculation in college, and three of the programs reduced students' dependency on loans. Most important, this evaluation finds that the programs modestly increased degree completion, measured after five years.

These results show that even relatively moderate investments in low-income students' education can have modest but long-lasting impacts on their academic outcomes. These findings may be especially relevant to states, institutions, and private scholarship providers seeking purposeful and efficient ways to give low-income students additional financial aid that can also help them succeed academically."
