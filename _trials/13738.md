abstract: "This study explores the impact of anticipated career interruptions due to child-rearing on individuals' decisions about marriage and fertility in South Korea. Recent literature has highlighted the compatibility of women's career and family goals as key drivers of fertility (Doepke et al., 2023). In this context, individuals' expectations about their own (or spouse's) career cost due to having a child may influence their family formation decisions. Especially in a society like South Korea, where extremely low fertility rates exist, these expectations are likely to be formed pessimistically and drive the birth rates even lower.

The main research questions this study aims to answer are the following:
R1) To what extent do individuals anticipate career costs associated with having a child? Are these expectations based on objective information?
R2) Is there a relationship between anticipated career costs and marital and fertility plans? Does adjusting anticipated costs through information lead to changes in these plans?
R3) How do the above differ according to individuals' characteristics, preferences, and experiences?

Specifically, we will conduct a survey among wage workers in South Korea aged 29-40. Through an information provision experiment, we will examine how providing objective information about the true probability of women continuing to work post-childbirth affects changes in expectations and family formation plans."
