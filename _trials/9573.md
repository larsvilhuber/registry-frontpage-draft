abstract: "We test for correlation sensitive preferences and extent results of Loewenfeld and Zheng (2021). First, we aim to replicate results from a task in which subjects have to choose between two lotteries with the same marginal distribution for subjects from the general Chinese population. Second, we test for correlation sensitive preferences in choices between first-order-stochastic dominant and dominated lotteries and explore the role of task complexity in this setting. "
