abstract: "We study the extent to which politics can shape ethnic preferences. We exploit time variation in political competition between ethnic groups caused by an episode of decentralization that increases in the number of provinces from 11 to 26 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Decentralization changes the extent to which different ethnic groups are key players in the political arena. In the region of interest, groups that were previously unimportant politically will become key players, and groups that were political competitors previously will gain majority control of their own province. We use a series of lab-in-the-field experiments, IATs, and surveys to examine how ethnic preferences change as a result of the decentralization process and evolve over time.
