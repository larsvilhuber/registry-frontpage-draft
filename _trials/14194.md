abstract: "This survey explores opinions concerning asylum seekers and refugees, as well as functioning of the European asylum system. In particular, we investigate to what extent it is perceived as fair and how this perception may shape opinions and policy preferences. Three dimensions of fairness are considered:  
1. Fair treatment of EU member states as hosts. The key issue here is the fair distribution of asylum seekers between countries. We want to know what rules and criteria participants would perceive as fair and whether they believe the current systems is fair.  
2. Procedures of the asylum system. We want to know if participants believe that asylum decisions are made based on appropriate criteria etc. 
3. Fair treatment of asylum seekers and refugees as compared to EU residents in need.  
On all the dimensions, we hypothesise that respondents will show greater solidarity towards refugees and asylum seekers if they perceive the system as fair. We verify these hypotheses by means of a randomised survey administered in eight EU member states. "
