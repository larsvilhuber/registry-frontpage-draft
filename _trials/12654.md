abstract: "We use novel German survey data to investigate how perceptions and information about public finances influence attitudes towards public debt and fiscal rules. The study is conducted in an online survey with about 3.800 Germans, where the sample is chosen to be representative of the overall population. 
Our survey experiment is conducted in two steps: In the first step, we randomly split the sample into three groups. The control group receives no anchor, whereas the debt-anchor groupand the interest-anchor group are informed about one historical value of the German debt-to-GDP or interest-to-tax-revenue ratio, respectively. In the second step of the experiment, we randomly provide information on the time series of the German debt-to-GDP or interest-to-tax-revenue ratios up to the most recently available year. Within these treatment groups, some respondents previously received the anchor, and some did not. After the information treatment, we measure respondents' views on public debt, on public investment and on the design of the debt brake.
