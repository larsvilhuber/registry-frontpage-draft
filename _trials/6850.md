abstract: "This study aims to investigate to what extent the membership in an energy community induces electricity conservation and enhances the effect of real-time feedback on water and energy consumption. It is the first study to explore this relationship in a field experiment, in which random assignment of participants to treatment groups allows for estimation of causal effects. The results are important for the effective design and support of energy communities and behavioral interventions to induce household electricity conservation."
