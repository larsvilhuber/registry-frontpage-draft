abstract: "Remedial education and differentiated instruction are promising approaches to tackle the low learning levels that plague many low- and middle-income countries. However, little is known about how to promote these strategies at scale. Researchers are evaluating the impact of the “Teaching at the Right Level” program on students’ foundational literacy and mathematics skills. The program—which runs in Zambia’s public primary schools and is locally known as “Catch Up”—divides children into groups based on their learning needs and pace and adds extra time during which teachers provide tailored instruction to each group. The study also investigates the effectiveness of combining the Catch Up program with a continuous professional development program for teachers. This trial was first registered ahead of completing its endline data collection; the trial's baseline report was also published at the beginning of the study period (https://www.gpekix.org/sites/default/files/webform/submit_to_the_library/268/TaRL%20Africa_Zambia%20Evaluation_%20Baseline%20Report%202023.pdf).
