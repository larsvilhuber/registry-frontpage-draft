abstract: "This study explores the motivations behind citizens’ investments in mental health, focusing on their beliefs regarding the private versus public benefits of such investments. Through an online experiment conducted across seven European countries, participants are exposed to various informational framings—private, public, and neutral—about mental health issues. The experiment measures their willingness to contribute to public goods and donate to mental health causes. Utilizing tools such as public good games, donation games, list experiments, and surveys, the study examines the role of social stigma, beliefs, and trust in shaping these behaviors. Findings aim to inform policies that incentivize mental health investments and address associated societal challenges."
