abstract: "We designed a field experiment to explore households' support for taxation and redistribution.  We designed an information-provision experiment with households who pay property taxes. We measure the households' support for taxation via survey data and by revealed-preference via the households' decisions to appeal their property taxes.

We examine two potential drivers of the support for taxation and the decision to protest property taxes:

1) The extent to which households benefit from the services that are funded through property taxes (more precisely, public schools).
2) The extent to which the property taxes are not spent in the same community but shared with more disadvantaged communities (more precisely, recapture of property taxes)."
