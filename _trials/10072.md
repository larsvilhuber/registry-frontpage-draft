abstract: "This project addresses two points concerning the spread of misinformation related to the upcoming 2022 Brazilian presidential election: 1) if traditional ways of ensuring electoral credibility are insufficient to persuade skeptics and 2) the extent to which misinformation can be corrected. In a survey experiment, participants are randomly exposed to positive and neutral information about the election or just neutral information. The intervention takes the form of critical thinking about the election and social pressure.

This project seeks to answer: 
1) In countries with weak institutional trust, what, if anything, will convince partisan voters that an election was fair? 
2) In an environment saturated with false information, is it possible to correct or partially correct these beliefs?
