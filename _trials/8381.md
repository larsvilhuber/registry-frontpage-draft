abstract: "This project proposes to study the effect of social media on individuals' political attitudes through an online survey experiment. Our experiment is designed to disentangle some of the precise mechanisms through which online interactions lead to political influence. Our focus is on the most common feature of social media interactions: likes. Can the number of likes we see on social media messages affect its influence on us? Does liking a post make us more persuaded by the post's content?  Does the salience of other participants' engagement matter? Does the fact that our likes are shown to others matter?

To answer these questions, we will conduct an online survey experiment in the context of the migration debate in the EU. We will recruit participants from four EU countries, Ireland, Italy, Hungary and France, which vary widely in their attitudes towards immigration."
