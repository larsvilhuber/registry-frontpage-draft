abstract: "Adoption of improved agricultural technologies in developing countries may be limited by common informational and market inefficiencies. In this study, we examine the role of such inefficiencies in the adoption of a new food safety technology, Aflasafe. Aflasafe has been shown to reduce aflatoxin contamination in maize by approximately 90%. However, this technology faces several barriers to widespread adoption. First, since Aflasafe is applied while the crop is still growing, its use increases farmersâ€™ exposure to yield risk. In the absence of a market for crop insurance, this may limit its adoption. Second, the lack of price incentives for food safety in markets served by smallholder maize producers in Kenya may constrain the adoption of food safety technologies by these farmers. In this study, we explore the impact on adoption of Aflasafe of 1) bundling the product with a rainfall index based money-back guarantee, and 2) access to an output market that rewards aflatoxin safety.
