abstract: "We are conducting an experiment to determine whether state-of-the-art language prediction models can outperform humans in areas of creativity and strategic intelligence. Comparing human performance to these advanced models is of paramount importance. This comparison sheds light on the level of competition that language models can present and the range of their potential applications, especially in areas traditionally seen as beyond their capabilities. Additionally, we also study effect of competition with artificial intelligence on creativity of human subjects, both for those who perform the tasks and for the evaluators, who might alter their perceptions of creativity when informed that some of the responses were generated by AI.
