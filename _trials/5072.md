abstract: "Property advertisements were supplemented with a new property-specific energy cost (annual) label using details from the propertyâ€™s Building Energy Rating (kWh and size) and a common energy price. This label was randomly assigned to half the counties in Ireland (with one exception: we impose Dublin and surrounding counties to the treatment group). The analysis period started in January 2017 and the new labels were applied between March 2018 and March 2019"
