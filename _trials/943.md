abstract: "This study evaluates the effectiveness of provision of information on wages at different education levels to 7th and 8th grade students in the Dominican Republic. The main part of the trial is a large-scale evaluation of two interventions that present such information in middle school classrooms. The 2015 intervention includes 600 public middle schools across the country. The two interventions were developed and implemented in partnership with the Dominican Ministry of Education. The base intervention consists of four 15-minute videos in a “telenovela” format in which the characters discuss the qualitative benefits of additional schooling. The second intervention adds additional segments that provide information on wage averages and distributions at different levels of schooling, allowing us to isolate the impact of providing quantitative information on the returns to schooling. Our primary outcome is school enrollment in the years following the interventions. We also conduct a series of surveys covering 43,000 students to measure beliefs of the returns to education, the feasibility of different educational options, and students’ educational plans. 

A second part of the study involves providing information on wages and education at an individual level on tablet computers. In addition to the information provision, we conduct in-depth surveys to elicit more detail on beliefs of the returns to schooling and educational plans. Separate treatment arms provide information and conduct surveys with students or parents."
