abstract: "Door-to-door health campaigns are a critical component of many health promotion, disease prevention, and surveillance efforts in a variety of contexts. Unfortunately, participation in these campaigns is often low, undermining the effectiveness of proven interventions. The dangers of low participation are particularly acute when threshold levels of coverage are needed to prevent disease, as a in vaccination or vector control campaigns. New approaches are needed to understand and influence household decisions to participate in door-to-door public health interventions. In this study, we apply novel basic science discoveries from behavioral economics to increase participation in an ongoing Chagas disease vector control campaign in Arequipa, Peru, where we have collaborated with the Ministry of Health for a decade. Low participation currently threatens the success of the campaign; the greatest barriers to participation reported by household include lost work hours, concerns about insecticide, and allergies. The overarching hypothesis of our study is that low rates of participation in door-to-door vector control campaigns can be significantly improved through interventions that incorporate the realities of human decision-making and behavior change. Recent insights from the field of behavioral economics suggest that common cognitive biases and mental shortcuts- such as present bias and following social norms- contribute to low participation in vector control campaigns, as they do in other domains. Through new formative work, we identified three interventions with high potential to overcome these biases and thereby increase participation: responsive scheduling with advance commitment, neighbor recruitment, and contingent group lotteries. The core of our proposed study is a cluster-randomized field trial to evaluate the impact of these three interventions. We first determine the rate of participation under each intervention, and then measure the programmatic and participant costs associated with each, to assess comparative cost-effectiveness. In addition, to address concerns about whether behavioral economic interventions lead to motivation crowd out- when extrinsic motivation for healthy behaviors reduces intrinsic motivation- we assess whether exposure to these interventions is correlated with decreased household participation in three subsequent health campaigns. The development, refinement, and scale-up of our interventions will yield evidence-based practices that can increase the impact of health promotion and disease prevention efforts in the United States and globally."
