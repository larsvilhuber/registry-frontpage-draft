abstract: "This project puts forward and tests the hypothesis that intimate partner violence impacts womenâ€™s economic decision-making. We estimate the causal impact of intimate partner violence on women's time preferences, cognitive functioning and risk preferences using a survey experiment. We assign respondents randomly to one of our two experimental arms. Respondents in the treatment arm are primed to think about episodes of IPV they may have experienced, using a survey instrument based on the well-established DHS and WHO instruments. Respondents in our control arm receive a placebo module. After the treatment or control module, respondents participate in incentivised activities to measure risk preferences, time preferences and cognitive functioning."
