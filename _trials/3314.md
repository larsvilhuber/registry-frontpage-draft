abstract: "This research looks at how the well-being and access to health-care of the indigents, a legally defined category of vulnerable people in DR Congo, is affected by (1) an external intervention seeking to durably alleviate the financial barrier the indigents may face when trying to seek care, (2) an intervention seeking to ease social relationships between the indigents and the community they live in (social barriers), and (3) the combination of both interventions. The study of each case is key to advance our understanding of the mechanisms that protect the poorest, as most research to date has focused either on the identification of those indigents or on short-term financial support. The interventions take place in the province of South Kivu, DRC, and covers 80 primary health care centres across 4 health zones close to Bukavu, the provincial capital. The interventions are implemented by the Dutch NGO Cordaid, which has been working in those areas for decades. Access to health care is evaluated through simple questions to the indigents while well-being relies on international survey instruments: WHOSDAS and PHQ. Qualitative work and surveys at the level of the health facilities help pinpoint the mechanisms (potentially) at play and ensure that meso-level invariants are accounted for."
