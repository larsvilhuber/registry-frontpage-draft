abstract: "In this project, we partner with Peninsula Clean Energy, a California electric utility, to evaluate the impacts of experimental electricity price schedules and control technology for electric vehicle (EV) owners on household electricity use. Electrified transportation is a critical component of global decarbonization plans; beyond reducing greenhouse gas emissions from driving, EVs may also balance intermittent renewables by providing battery services to the grid. The ability to realize these benefits depends on two factors: 1) how EV owners respond to the pricing incentives that align private and social marginal costs of electricity consumption, and 2) EV owners' willingness to allow utilities to directly manage their charging load. We  use a randomized controlled trial to estimate consumers' willingness to accept novel rates, including time-of-use price schedules and managed charging plans where consumers cede control over their charging to the utility. We will then quantify the impacts of these experimental electricity pricing plans on the timing and amount of EV electricity consumed."
