abstract: "The monthly ifo business surveys are among the most well-known [or important] business surveys in Germany. Recent evidence shows that 20% of all participating firms still use the paper version, which is environmentally and economically costlier than the online alternative. We conduct an RCT with N=1900 firms to investigate how firms can be nudged to switch from paper to the online survey. We test the effects of descriptive norms and pro-environmental appeals (each vs. a control condition)."
