abstract: "A major social and economic problem in developing countries is widespread abuse of alcohol, especially among young men. In western Kenya, a highly populated area with significant levels of rural poverty, illicit sale and consumption of locally brewed spirits appears to be causing significant negative societal impacts: harming health, decreasing agricultural productivity, and leading to intra-household conflict. The resulting detrimental health and economic effects on women can be especially severe. Despite its severity, there has been very little research in the development economics literature analyzing methods to decrease alcohol abuse and its corresponding deleterious impact on women and economic productivity. In this study, we seek to determine whether an alcohol counseling and outreach program in rural Western Kenya can increase levels of sobriety and decrease expenditures on alcohol. While this program will primarily target alcohol usage, we are interested in associated effects of the program on spousal relations (IPV), intra-household information sharing, and economic productivity."
