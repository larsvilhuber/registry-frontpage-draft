abstract: "Companies are continuously striving to design effective incentive schemes that motivate employees to provide high levels of effort at low costs. Companies can choose between monetary incentives and a great variety of non-monetary incentives. One of these incentives are awards which can be used to honor several kinds of behavior. In this study it is tested if the handing out of awards for ethical behavior changes participantsâ€™ subsequent productivity level. Ethical behavior is measured with a donation decision. The experiment will be conducted in the laboratory.  "
