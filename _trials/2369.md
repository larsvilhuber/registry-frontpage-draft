abstract: "Tax morale has been shown to affect individualsâ€™ willingness to pay taxes. There is evidence that people comply more when they see the government in action and public monies being used for the good of the community (reciprocity). There is also partial evidence that information about what the government does with the money matters too. This result has been more elusive. One possibility for the high variance in results could be that interventions have differed in the intensity of the treatments. Other possibility is that average results mask high heterogeneity across individuals based on their priors about the efficiency and efficacy of the government. These priors may be affected by their previous experience with the government. In this project we aim to disentangle among these hypotheses by evaluating the role of messages in the context of a large infrastructure campaign (i.e., high intensity treatment). We aim to evaluate the marginal effect of informing taxpayers about the use of public monies and check for heterogeneity according to the services each taxpayer receives (e.g., pave roads or dirt roads), and according to changes in their stock of public services. In terms of policy relevance, we can evaluate the marginal effect of information on top of the effect that public works would have by itself (people see the works and change their payment behavior). In this project, we also evaluate the effect of promises about future public works in the context of a local government with relatively low levels of trust but recently engaged in the expansion of public works. If people believe in promises, then governments could use them to finance future works in advance."
