abstract: "This study revisits the topic of joint accounts and assess how their terms, increasingly varied due to innovations in the fintech sector, affect intrahousehold allocation decisions. Through an experimental lab setting in Kolkata, India, we assess the impact of labeling, transparency and spousal approval on expenditure allocations of spouses. We also assess the impact of personally earning money on subsequent expenditure decisions of couples and specifically under different joint account terms. This study contributes to the literature in three ways. First, we contribute to existing experimental literature on joint accounts, extending it in the context of the fintech era. Second, we contribute to the literature on the impacts of financial product access/individualization on welfare-enhancing allocation decisions. Third, we contribute to the social protection literature on the relevance of workfare versus transfers. Specifically, we build on the behavioral economics concept of mental accounting, where Thaler (2008) suggested that earned money may be treated differently to unearned money."
