abstract: "Can non-financial incentives promote cost-effective health care in contexts where worker incentives cannot be fully aligned with those of their employers? If so, given that healthcare is provided in teams of specialized workers, to whom should such incentives be directed? We implement a field experiment in the leading public hospital in Israel to investigate whether nudges can motivate surgical teams to reduce wasteful spending without sacrificing quality of care. Our intervention consists of text messages containing encouragement as well as procedure-specific information on the median usage of disposable items. We randomly vary whether the surgeon, the circulating nurse, or both receive the message. We outline the mechanisms that might cause effects to differ depending on which combination of team members are treated. We exploit rich data on input use and patient outcomes to estimate treatment effects on both the cost and quality of care. "
