abstract: "This study uses a combination of lab-in-the-field and vignette experiments to assess the relative importance of different motives for which husbands might use violence against their wives, as well as the reasons for which low-income husbands use more violence than high-income husbands. In the lab-in-the-field experiment, “choosers” choose whether or not to transgress a social norm (eat the better plate themselves) and “responders” choose whether and how much to respond using a harmless punishment proxy (seconds of annoying sound). We randomly vary conditions to test whether the responders’ decision varies with 1) whether the chooser has additional information about the responder, 2) whether it was made before or after learning the chooser’s choice, and 3) whether the chooser’s choice (and the responder’s response) is observable to others. In the vignette experiment, subjects respond to a vignette story and oral description of a hypothetical couple and state their first- and second-order beliefs about the prevalence and social acceptability of spousal “disciplining” in different situations in which the wife might transgress a social norm. We will correlate the stated beliefs in the vignettes with the incentivized choices in the lab-in-the-field experiment to establish the external relevance of the lab-in-the-field experiment for intimate partner violence.
