abstract: "Many states have implemented tuition assistance programs to help adults earn credentials that will improve their economic prospects. However, those seeking better employment opportunities also need help identifying the training pathways that lead to their desired careers. We have developed a low-cost intervention that synthesizes information on high-demand, high-wage jobs and local training options. This study examines the effects of providing some individuals with access to a website, MI Pathway, that contains this information. "
