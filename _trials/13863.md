abstract: "We conduct a survey to understand the valuation that individuals make when deciding how much to transfer to compensate for different circumstances. To do this we present hypothetical scenarios where the respondent has to allocate money to two potential beneficiaries. The beneficiaries are equal in all their characteristics but differ on one silent attribute associated with a circumstance. In addition, we randomly assign some individuals to receive information about the effort the potential beneficiaries put into searching for a job. The survey collects information surveying young people. On one hand, our results will provide evidence about how individuals value different circumstances. In addition, results will allow us to understand how individuals perceive the relationship between effort and circumstances. "
