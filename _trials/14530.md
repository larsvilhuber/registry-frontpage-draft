abstract: "This study evaluates the impact of generative AI on software developer productivity by
analyzing data from three randomized controlled trials conducted at Microsoft, Accenture,
and an anonymous Fortune 100 electronics manufacturing company. These field
experiments, which were run by the companies as part of their ordinary course of business,
provided a randomly selected subset of developers with access to GitHub Copilot, an AIbased
coding assistant that suggests intelligent code completions."
