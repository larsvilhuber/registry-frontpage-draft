abstract: "I investigate how changing incentives schemes can affect worker effort by manipulating salience. I test the predictions of a salience model in an online experiment, where I vary the salience of different aspects of an incentive scheme, holding constant the objective expected incentives. I test whether by doing so workers can be made to exert more effort relative to the Bayesian benchmark."
