abstract: "A central question in designing optimal policies concerns the assignment of individuals with different observable characteristics to different treatments (policies). We study this question in the context of increasing workerâ€™s performance by using the appropriate incentives. Concretely,  we study whether and to what extent the impact of incentive schemes on performance can be improved through a targeted assignment of the implemented scheme to the characteristics of the respective worker. To do so, we will run a set of large-scale real-effort experiments with approximately 9,000 workers on Amazon MTurk."
