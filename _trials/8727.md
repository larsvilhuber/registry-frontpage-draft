abstract: "We study the long-term impacts of offering monetary incentives for vaccination on future vaccination uptake, safety perceptions, and morals. To do so, we exploit the setting of an earlier study that offered payment to people for getting a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine (Campos-Mercade et al., 2021), which provides us with random variation in exposure to monetary incentives. We match the data with Swedish registry data on vaccination uptake for the unincentivized second dose. We then survey study participants about their willingness to take a third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (booster shot), moral values related to vaccination and risk and benefit perceptions of vaccinations."
