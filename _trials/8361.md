abstract: "All around the globe, boys and girls attending schools experience gender-based violence (GBV).  Such violent behaviors often go unnoticed and are rarely punished. Thus, how can we prevent GBV?  A potential mechanism to prevent GBV among boys and girls attending schools is to provide information about what violence is, why it is unacceptable, and what can be done around it. But who should receive the information: girls, boys or both?  Moreover, even if the information changes the norms around violence, can this lead to a reduction in GBV? Finally, how does this impact school attendance and performance? 

This project aims to answer the above questions through a novel and large-scale in-school program in the province of Sofala, Mozambique. In collaboration with the Ministry of Education of Mozambique, UNICEF Mozambique and the NGO Girl Child Rights, the research team developed the intervention: “Está na Hora de Agir!” (It is time to act!). The intervention strengthens the existing GBV curriculum and disseminates it for upper primary schools through animated videos and in-school guided discussion. The experimental design allows us to evaluate the effect of the intervention delivered to girls, boys, girls, and boys jointly, on the prevalence of GBV, school attendance, and performance.
