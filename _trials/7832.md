abstract: "We consider the group size effect in principal-agent settings, i.e. whether the number of principals determines the agents action.

The aim of this study is to extend our previous work and systematically increase group sizes to generate and fully test a model of the impact of group sizes on decisions taken. We need to include responsibility effects in economic decision models to predict choices of key decision makers such as politicians or governmental regulators. Other-regarding preference models only internalise the effects for others as a trade-off between payments for the decision maker and the affected parties. To fully understand the effects of the number of people affected by a decision, we need to include a responsibility parameter in these decision models. The impact might be linear, as current results suggest, but it could also be non-linear where, e.g., a very large group could be viewed as one entity with increased social distance and lower impact of responsibility on the decision. This study will extend existing social preference models and test the model predictions in a large-scale online experiment.
