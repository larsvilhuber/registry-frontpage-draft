abstract: "In the absence of formal health insurance, low-income households often rely on costly coping strategies to finance health expenses, or simply forgo healthcare altogether. Health insurance can thus improve access to healthcare and reduce financial stress, but only if people buy it. In this trial, we collaborate with a health insurance provider in rural Uganda and study experimentally how premiums and co-payment levels affect insurance take-up, utilization of health services, and health outcomes.
