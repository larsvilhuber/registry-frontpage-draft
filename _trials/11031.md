abstract: "Widespread financial fragility in the United States, in which one in three adults report they could not pay a $400 emergency expense with cash, could leave low-income households vulnerable to a cycle of debt that prevents them from being able to escape poverty. There is little causal evidence on the implications of unanticipated financial shocks for low-income individuals, and even less evidence on emergency financial assistance provided at the time of such shock. In this paper, we partner with a non-profit that provides financial assistance for burial and funeral (BaF) services to individuals with household incomes below 40% AMI in a large U.S. city. Nationwide the median cost of a funeral with viewing and burial is about $8,000. Even for low-income families, these expenses are hard to avoid for cultural and religious reasons. We estimate that 1 in 50 households experience a death each year. Using a randomized controlled trail, two-thirds of study participants will randomly receive $1000 towards BaF expenses, while the other third will receive a higher amount of financial support (to be revealed publicly at study completion). Using administrative records, we will passively track impacts on credit outcomes, housing stability (moves, evictions, and interactions with homelessness services), and earnings and employment. We anticipate that funding will support a sample size of 672 participants, enabling us to detect a 0.20 standard deviation change in a standardized credit index. We will also explore an event-study analysis and (potentially) a matched-sample event-study approach, to estimate the impact of the shock itself with little or no financial assistance.
