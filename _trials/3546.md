abstract: "To further investigate the effect of anchoring on Credit Card repayments. We aim to examine whether certain additional treatments can mitigate the existing anchoring effects of minimum repayment information  ie. Whether, when provided with a repayment calculator the individual can calculate the optimal repayment rate and whether a positive anchor or nudge is just as effective as the negative ones used by card companies in the past.
