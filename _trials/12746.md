abstract: "This project builds on a previous study conducted in 2021 on Code in Place, a five-week-long online programming course where we found that automated feedback to instructors can improve their instruction and student satisfaction. The current study was conducted in the spring of 2023 on Code in Place, and its goal is to understand whether providing instructors agency in choosing the type of automated feedback they would like to receive influences their engagement with and impact of the feedback. Learner agency is thought to enhance engagement and improve outcomes, but few empirical studies have examined its effect in instructor learning settings. To answer this question, the study leverages both manual annotation and computational natural language processing techniques. "
