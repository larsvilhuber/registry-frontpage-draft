abstract: "This study will evaluate how exposure to different information on domestic issues affect Australians' attitudes towards migration. The first aim of this research is to document people’s perceptions and views of migrants to Australia and opinions on migration policy going forward. Secondly, this research seeks to quantify how the manner of the media’s reporting affects public opinion, and whether providing accurate information on migration in Australia changes people's views. This will be done by fielding an online survey with an embedded experiment to approximately 6000 Australians, in which some randomly selected respondents will receive information or short excerpts of news articles relating to important domestic policy issues such as housing, to see if this results in different responses to those who receive no information or news articles. This trial will show whether providing accurate information or various vignettes can change people's views on migration."
