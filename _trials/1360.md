abstract: "Temporary farm input subsidies are one of the main policy tools for addressing low productivity in African agriculture, as they reduce the costs and risks that smallholder farmers face when experimenting with modern inputs. Without a clear exit strategy, however, subsidy programs may become fiscally unsustainable. Moreover, there is no rigorous evidence on whether program efficacy varies by subsidy level. In collaboration with the Government of Uganda, this impact evaluation aims to identify the impact of a temporary farm input subsidy on the use of, returns to, and learning about modern farm inputs by smallholder farmers. The evaluation will study these impacts both during and after the period of time when farmers receive subsidies. By studying these impacts of the pilot subsidy program, the impact evaluation will inform subsidy design for subsequent roll out of the subsidy program throughout Uganda."
