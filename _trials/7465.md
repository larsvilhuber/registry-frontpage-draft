abstract: "Recognition-respect across cultural boundaries can be affected by civil servants. We evaluate the causal effects of scaleable ways to foster more progressive gender norms. We collaborate with a network of schools in Pakistan to train teachers and measure their own and their studentsâ€™ preferences, attitudes, and beliefs linked to administrative data on student outcomes. We horserace different ways progressive gender norms can be fostered by training empathy, using medium of visual narrative and by curriculum. In addition, based on a recent meeting with our collaborating network of schools, we now also intend to investigate potential costs associated with fostering more progressive gender norms among teachers, in terms of stress and domestic violence.
