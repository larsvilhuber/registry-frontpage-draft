abstract: "The European Union has recently introduced an external rotation requirement to enhance auditor independence and audit quality. Prior literature argues that audit firm rotation may enhance auditor independence because it reduces economic incentives to retain the client. This study goes beyond the economic effects and considers the effects of the rotation requirement on the personal relationship between the auditor and the client. Based on the dual concern model, we argue that a weaker personal relationship between both parties due to the rotation requirement can hinder effective auditor-client negotiations. In contrast, the personal relationship that develops when the auditor is retained for several periods can enable integrative solutions. Moreover, we argue that the positive effects of a personal relationship can be realized especially when the auditor has sufficient power. To test our hypotheses, we follow an experimental economics approach. This approach enables us to disentangle financial incentives from affective commitment arising from a personal relationship."
