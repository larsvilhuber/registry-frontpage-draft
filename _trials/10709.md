abstract: "Since Chen (2013), a fast-growing body of literature has documented abundant supporting evidence for the linguistic-savings hypothesis (LSH). Despite this influx of research, direct causal evidence is limited. In the present study, we will re-examine the LSH within English, a strong future time reference language, using English monolingual subjects. In our experiment, participants will be randomly assigned to either "will" or "no will" condition and make a series of binary decisions in a standard time preference task, choosing between an immediate, smaller reward, versus a delayed larger reward. In the "will" condition, the delayed rewards will be described using future tense, whereas, in the "no will" condition, the delayed rewards will be described using present tense by omitting the future tense marking."
