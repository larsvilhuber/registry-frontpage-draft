abstract: "Background: Why do we love dogs and eat pigs? Serpell (2004) states that this inconsistency can be explained by the psychological categorization of certain animals as objects of affect and other animals as objects of utility. Research suggests that using anthropomorphic messages (i.e., messages that humanize animals) can reduce meat consumption or in other words, change the way individuals perceive animals that are typically considered objects of utility.
Objectives: To test the effectiveness of an anthropomorphic message (an image montage with voiceover) in influencing the emotional response to animal images, support for animal welfare policies and relevant individual efforts (revealed preference).
Method: We use an online survey and a within as well as between-subjects research design on a demographically representative, German sample of 1,500 participants. Those in the control group would not see any montage. Those in the experimental groups would watch a montage containing an anthropomorphic and emotional message about “farm animals”. The hypothesis is that participants in the experimental group will have a different emotional response to the images of farm animals than those in the control, greater support for policies supporting animal welfare and plant-based products, pay more for meat-replacement products, and donate more to an animal welfare charity."
