abstract: "This project explores the link between skill-creation and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) expansion in developing countries. We do so by evaluating a number of labour market interventions involving both young unemployed workers and SMEs in Uganda. On the labor supply side, we study the impact of a formal in-class vocational training program (VTP) on improving the labour market outcomes of young workers, and contrast this to the impact of informal apprenticeships. On the labour demand side, we test various interventions designed to exogenously ease such constraints related to credit, wages, and information about available skilled or unskilled workers, within the same empirical setting. As the project deals with both the demand and supply sides of the labor market, we are able to study how workers and SMEs match to each other, and in particular how the matching process is facilitated by SMEs having information about individuals that are willing to work, or information about individuals that are available to work and have been recently skilled. In addition, this project seeks to understand the indirect spillover effects of such interventions on firms in the social, business and market networks of directly treated firms. In an extension to this project, we track the original sample of workers over a longer period to study the longer-term impacts of the interventions on the labor market outcomes of workers after eight years, and to compare the effectiveness of formal vocational training and informal apprenticeships in building resilience to the economic shock caused by Covid-19."
