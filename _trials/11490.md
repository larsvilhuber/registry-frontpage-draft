abstract: "In poor neighborhoods across Latin America, one of the largest social organizations is the street gang. They are often the largest employer in the neighborhood, especially of poor adolescent boys. It’s striking, then, how little we understand these firms and, most importantly, the decision-making process of young recruits. Medellin, Colombia, has hundreds of well-organized street gangs. We have partnered with the Secretariat of Education to conduct a population-based survey of two cohorts of grade 7 boys. We intend to conduct the surveys in roughly half of Medellin’s 200 public schools, and anticipate that roughly 10,000 boys will participate. In addition to measuring a variety of risk factors and preferences, the survey measures boys’ expectations of the pecuniary and non-pecuniary returns to various careers: low-skill, medium-skill, high-skill, and gang/criminal careers. It also assesses boys’ self-reported interest in each career and the career interests of their friends. Finally, the survey incorporates a series of information experiments to test whether it is possible to correct any misperceptions associated with gang entry. We used a first wave of roughly 1,200 surveys to identify likely misperceptions and pilot information experiments. These will be tested in the remaining to-be-surveyed sample. Experiment 1 targets the perceived returns to medium- and high- skill careers. Experiment 2 targets the perceived non-pecuniary returns to criminal/gang careers (status and enjoyability). We are interested in how these information treatments affect posterior beliefs, career interest in the gang, and interest in and take-up of information on non-criminal careers.

Note that this experimental design was updated in September 2023 to reflect the second information experiment launched in the same month."
