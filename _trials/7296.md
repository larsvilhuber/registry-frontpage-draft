abstract: "In the proposed project, we are particularly interested in understanding the determinants of mental health and wellbeing of female members of the households, who are responsible for most of the household chores, elderly and child care and are also most likely to be victims of domestic violence with everyone restricted to their houses, and especially so in case they and/or their husbands are returnee migrants or have lost their jobs/sources of income. With limited interaction with friends and neighbors, along with increased household responsibilities, woman could feel stressed, isolated and lonely, without access to any kind of counseling. We are particularly interested in examining what works best for women in an Indian setting â€“ counseling in the form of an in-person one-to-on counselling or an anonymous support in a discussion group."
