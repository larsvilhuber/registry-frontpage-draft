abstract: "The proposed project aims to analyze the determinants of fairness views in Germany. We examine how fairness views differ across socio-demographic groups, how they are correlated with political attitudes and how information treatments on inter- and intragenerational fairness affect those attitudes and behaviour in an incentivized donation question. To this end, we run an online survey experiment in Germany."
