abstract: "The situation between investors and startups is typically characterized by asymmetric information inducing adverse selection and thus suboptimal investments. To mitigate inefficiencies, investors often engage in costly verification processes referred to as due diligence. Additionally, latest technological innovations help to considerably reduce transaction costs. In this project, we suggest a novel “startup investment game” experiment and a series of treatments to test for the effects of costly verification and self-verification. Depending on the results, a policy conclusion could be to support platforms based on the recent self-verification technologies."
