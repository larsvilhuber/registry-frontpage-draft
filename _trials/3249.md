abstract: "This project seeks to understand how individuals respond to financial incentive programs for wellness care. In a randomized controlled trial among customers with HEDIS care gaps, we will experimentally compare the impacts of incentives for gap closure (gift cards), information on existing gaps (mailers), and no intervention. The research objectives are to assess how responsive individuals are to incentives for, and to information about, existing care gaps; and to assess spillovers from incentives onto other care. In addition, impacts on downstream utilization will be studied, which may be impacted if financial incentives are effective at increasing wellness visits."
