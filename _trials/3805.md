abstract: "This is an implementation study to prepare for a randomized control trial of a high school dropout prevention program, Jobs for Americaâ€™s Graduates (JAG). The key objective of this pilot study is to collaborate with local partners to lay the foundations for a randomized controlled of JAG, that will evaluate the impact of JAG on academic and labor market outcomes for low-income students at risk of failing to graduate. The pilot will focus on preparing three components of an RCT: an outreach strategy to recruit more eligible participants into the JAG program, an enrollment process based on a lottery, and the establishment of data sharing agreements and data transfer procedures with relevant administrative data holders.
