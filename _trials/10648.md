abstract: "We study the uptake of solar panels financed through micro-loans by micro-enterprises and small businesses in rural Pakistan. Working with 1400 households, we test two interventions randomized at the household level: first, we provide households with a one-time subsidy payment at the beginning of the loan-period. Second, we provide an index-insurance throughout the loan repayment period that aims at insuring low returns of solar panels. Besides uptake behavior, we are testing the impacts of the two interventions on business profits, investments, and income variations over time. Individuals who meet the loan-eligibility criteria of the micro-finance institution and run a small business or enterprise are eligible for the treatments, which are assigned using a lottery for which the clients can apply."
