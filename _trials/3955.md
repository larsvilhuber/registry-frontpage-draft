abstract: "About 15% of the population in the Netherlands and other European countries have an immigrant background (either first, second or third generation). The percentage is likely to increase in the near future due to immigration flows from the Middle East and Northern Africa, and the expected demographic changes caused by, for example, climate change. This poses challenges for society. To illustrate, immigrants in the Netherlands and other European countries are more likely to be at risk of poverty, are more likely to be unemployed, and, if employed, earn substantially less than natives or have a job for which they are overqualified. 
Several factors underlie the achievement gap between “natives” and people with an immigrant background. Research has shown that discrimination, referring to differential treatment of others under ceteris paribus conditions, may be one of the factors. A key question for policy makers and scientists is how such discrimination can be overcome. An answer to the question can possibly be found in Allport (1954)’s contact theory. The theory presumes that discrimination is the consequence of natives viewing others with an immigrant background as an ‘out-group’ with whom they have little in common. The theory predicts that positive contact in the form of personal interaction, sharing of common goals, cooperating in joint projects reduces discrimination. In this paper we study whether positive contact indeed reduces discrimination in the context of social interaction between Dutch natives and people with an immigrant background.
