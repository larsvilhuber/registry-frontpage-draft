abstract: "In this study, we analyze the political and economic consequences of providing information about waiting times in healthcare. With this objective, we plan to implement a number of large-scale online experiments conducted on a representative sample of the Spanish population. Spain was one of the most severely affected countries by the Covid-19 pandemic, which critically impacted access to healthcare for non-urgent visits and procedures, leading to a substantial lengthening in waiting times for both specialist visits and elective surgeries.

Our main research question is to study how providing information about the waiting times for healthcare surgeries and consultations and about the difference in service provision across Spanish regions affect trust in institutions, support for extremist parties, polarization, and distributive preferences, among other political attitudes.
