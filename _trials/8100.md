abstract: "As a sustainable transition, carsharing can be beneficial along each of the sustainability dimensions: the environmental, the economic, the social. Carsharing: a service to hire a car on a per-hour/day basis, may imply less car use, reducing emissions and the number cars on the roads compared to private car ownership. Carsharing is more rational and efficient: fewer cars and lower fixed costs, and it provides an easy and affordable access to car for those who only need it occasionally or cannot afford to buy a car. 
Recent results from the literature highlighted a general lack of information around car-sharing in Norway. How to inform people, and what kind of information can impact individual choice and facilitate diffusion of this innovative transport mode, have, as far as we know, not been addressed in the literature. 
The goal of the trial is to increase carsharing, ideally by people who have an old and underutilized car and might be persuaded to go car-less, or who are considering to purchase a (second) car. This will be achieved by running a large-scale randomized controlled trial in the field, where a selected targeted audience, based on their predicted receptiveness to car-sharing, will be nudged over to car-sharing by using a car-sharing calculator.
