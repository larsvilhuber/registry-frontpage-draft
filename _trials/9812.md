abstract: "A growing literature in economics and other disciplines have studied the role of apologies in restoring the bonds of trust. Except for a few exceptions, most of these studies have been done in lab settings. In this study, we look to well publicized celebrity apologies. We collect a sample of celebrity apologies based on two online databases: a New York Times dataset of celebrities who were publicly reprimanded during the #metoo movement and a dataset compiled by the online apology blog SorryWatch who noted and analyzed a number of celebrity apologies in the recent decades. We use online raters to categorize and assess the effectiveness of these apologies. (We also will train a machine learning model based on the rating data to automate future apology classification.) We then match the categorized apology data to twitter data where we use sentiment analysis to analyze the sentiment (either positive or negative) of tweets that mention the celebrity in the time periods before the violation, after the violation but before the apology, after the apology, and in the years after the apology.
This research will examine real world impacts of apologies, and importantly tie the content of the apology to the outcomes. We classify apologies based on a game theory model from Ho (Mgmt Sci 2012). Recent related work examining real world impacts of the apology using that classification can be found in field experiments involving Uber customers (Halperin, Ho, List, Muir EJ 2022) and in stock market event studies (Fan, Ge, Ho, Mal Ssrn working paper, 2021).
Our research also explores new methods to use machine learning to classify apologies, and to assess their real world impacts. "
