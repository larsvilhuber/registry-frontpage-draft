abstract: "Self-care among PhD students is a crucial determinant of their academic success and overall well-being. Although universities offer various services, such as mental health care, time management resources, and mentorship programs, these benefits are only realized if students choose to access them. Various barriers, including financial and opportunity costs, as well as behavioral factors related to perceptions, knowledge, and beliefs about these services, can deter students from engaging with them.
This experiment aims to test whether PhD students across the US are willing to promote self-care habits among their peers by associating their names with statements about self-care practices and to estimate students' willingness to accept any shame—or their willingness to pay for the pride—associated with publicly endorsing these statements.
