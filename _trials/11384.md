abstract: "We will use the experimental methodology to conduct an intervention of the growth mindset for Chinese schoolchildren who are aged from 10-11 with regards to high and low socio-economic status (SES). The sample comes from a China's primary school where we will randomize classes into control groups (treated) and treated groups. Relevant preferences will be measured for examining the effects of an intervention. Through a several-week curriculum, we aim at improving the growth mindset of schoolchildren from low SES families and reducing the difference in growth mindset, academic outcomes, and relevant preferences between high and low SES children."
