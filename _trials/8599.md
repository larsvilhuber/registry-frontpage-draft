abstract: "Using a RCT design, we will attempt to understand the issue of vaccine hesitancy in India and understand whether awareness campaign about the benefits associated with vaccination, non-financial incentives provided via a sure gift or lucky draw gift payment (both conditional upon acceptance), making vaccine more accessible or communication intervention to address misconception by eminent figures in the community reduce vaccine hesitancy and lead to widespread vaccination using the government funded free vaccines. Therefore, the objective of this study is to understand the barriers to vaccine take-up and identify the most effective way to increase it. "
