abstract: "This study will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with low-income adults in Tamil Nadu to answer two sets of questions. First, can inexpensive and scalable interventions involving phone-delivered psychological first aid (PFA) and temporary cash support boost mental health and economic resilience among low-income households in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic? Second, do these interventions improve peopleâ€™s capacity to seek out and retain useful information, and thus to engage in protective health behaviors? Third, do these interventions make people prosocial (i.e. more generous with others, and less prejudiced towards minority groups)? Our participants will be randomized into three groups: (i) a control group, (ii) a cash transfer treatment group which receives a one-time transfer of approximately 5,000 Rs, and (iii) a PFA treatment group which receives repeated psychosocial support over the phone from trained lay providers."
