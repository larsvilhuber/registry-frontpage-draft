abstract: "This study seeks to investigate whether temptation declines over time; in particular, whether short waiting periods influenced the preference for healthy food choices.  This project was previously completed prior to my awareness of the AEA RCT, in early 2015.

The abstract for the working draft can be found below:

Does temptation decline over time? Recent studies have highlighted the importance of Pavlovian cues for intertemporal decision making but less is known about how these cues change over time. To theoretically motivate the existence of these Pavlovian responses, an evolutionary principal-agent model is developed in which optimal temptation declines over time. In a laboratory experiment, subjects make a choice between bananas and chocolate, but some are informed 3 minutes prior that the choice will soon arrive. These treated subjects had no way to indicate their preferences in advance, yet were 28% more likely to choose a banana. Using effort induced by a preceding experiment, I also find no evidence of a resource- or ego-depletion effect."
