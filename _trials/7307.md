abstract: "
The learning crisis caused by the covid-19 pandemic is unprecedented. As governments seek to address the learning loss, so far, we know tutoring has been a widely proposed solution because it has proven to have a big positive effect on learning. We propose an RCT which can contribute to the literature of tutoring by looking at the interactions between interventions such as tutoring and tracking, and how socio emotional learning can affect the student’s self-perception, as well as group peer effects. Additionally, we can contribute to the very limited existing causal literature on peer tutoring and its effects on learning. We will be working with k-12 school students from 3rd to 12th grade and focusing on math tutoring. The tutors will be recruited among the universities and normal schools across Mexico.
