abstract: "Domestic violence carries vast individual and social costs. Survivor support services have a high potential to mitigate these costs, but various barriers to access faced by survivors diminish their reach and effectiveness. This study evaluates the impact of a change in the service protocol of Colombia's national hotline for women victims of violence (Línea 155) on the likelihood of victims accessing institutional help services and the type of services used. The key change in the hotline’s service protocol introduced a follow-up call to survivors aimed at addressing behavioral barriers often faced by victims when seeking institutional help. To measure the impact of this change in the service protocol, we will use an experimental design (RCT) and compare the usage of institutional help services among callers who did and did not receive the follow-up call."
