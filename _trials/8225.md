abstract: "We are planning to conduct a field experiment on a NASDAQ-listed firm and its customers to investigate the impact of the firm's gifts (monetary versus in-kind) on the receiving buyers' reciprocal decisions. As one of the first studies in the field to explore such a topic using a randomised experiment, we aim to provide answers to such question as â€˜do customers reciprocate?', 'which types of gifts are the most effective and why?' This research should contribute to several strands of the existing economics literature on positive reciprocity and seller-buyer interactions. Any potential findings could also benefit the firm as it operates in an exceedingly competitive business environment.
