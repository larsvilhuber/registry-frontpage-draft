abstract: "In an increasingly diverse population, an ongoing debate is whether or not affirmative action policies should favor more than one minority group. When such a policy is implemented, the affirmed group is not identifiable with certainty. We experimentally study how this feature affects the outcomes of affirmative action policies in a tournament context. In the baseline treatment, no affirmative action is implemented. In the gender quota treatment (GQ), affirmative action in the form of a gender quota makes the affirmed group (female) certainly identified. In the other treatment, a quota for both gender and a randomly assigned characteristic is applied in order to reduce the identity salience of females as an affirmed group. We test the difference in efficiency, willingness to compete, and partner selection in teamwork. "
