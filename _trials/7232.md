abstract: "Sleep deprivation is prevalent in modern societies leading to negative health and economic
consequences. However, we know little about why people decide to sleep less than the recommended
number of hours. This study investigates the mechanisms affecting sleep choice
and explores whether commitment devices and monetary incentives can be used to promote
healthier sleep habits."
