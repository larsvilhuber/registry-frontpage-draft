abstract: "We run a large-scale randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the impacts of attending an almost year-long intensive training program (Freedom English Academy or FEA) on the English skills, non-cognitive skills, and labor market outcomes of low-income youth in urban India. Specifically, we randomize 1,200 low-income youth in Delhi to one of two conditions: (a) immediate enrollment in FEA or (b) deferred (one-year) enrollment in FEA. After approximately ten months, we measure impacts from attending FEA on labor market outcomes (estimated wages), English listening and speaking skills, and non-cognitive (social) skills. "
