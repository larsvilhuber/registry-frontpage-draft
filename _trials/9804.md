abstract: "Against a 7 MT/Ha yield potential, smallholder farmers benefiting from the Affordable Input Program (AIP) in Malawi produce about 1.8 MT/Ha of maize. Low maize productivity in Malawi is partly caused by poor soil health, which can be addressed by supplementary soil fertility management interventions (SFMIs). We are implementing a randomised control trial (RCT) to evaluate the impact of integrating SFMIs in AIP on maize productivity and the demand for SFMIs. We will test the effect of adding agricultural lime and organic fertiliser to AIP inputs, i.e., improved maize seeds and inorganic fertiliser. The RCT is implemented in districts with acidic soils of Mzimba and Nkhoakota, which require liming. The findings from this trial will contribute to Malawiâ€™s long-term development plan (MW2063) of increasing agricultural productivity. The findings stand a chance of being incorporated into the new national agricultural policy being developed. "
