abstract: "The Government of India is pushing for its citizens to gain access to clean and reliable sources of energy. Presently, 300 million Indians do not have access to electricity and 800 million use relatively polluting and inconvenient fuels, firewood, crop residue, dung cakes and charcoal, for cooking. The main alternative to these fuels for cooking is liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and the government has announced a target of 75% adoption by 2015. Nearly 15 million new consumers are signing up for LPG every year. 

The main challenge in achieving these targets is cost. Electricity connections and LPG refills are costly to citizens at market prices, and costly to government in the form of subsidies. One way to improve access while reducing cost is to increase the efficiency of energy use.  A major tool used for the promotion of efficiency in many countries is the provision of information via the labelling of appliances, in order to boost customer demand for efficiency.

This study will measure the effect of an energy-star label for LPG stoves on customer demand for more efficient models. The main research question is: Does the energy star-label effect customer decisions on which stove to buy? Furthermore, the study aims to understand the demonstrated willingness to pay for a star-labelled stove, and the level of trust in government standards.

 The research design is a field experiment that partners with the distributor networks of oil manufacturing companies (OMCs) in urban and semi-urban markets. The primary intervention will be providing customers with information on the thermal efficiency of stoves.
