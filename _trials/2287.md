abstract: "The aim of the project is to study the effects of a program offering temporary employment to young people registered in schools in Uruguay. The program, called “Yo estudio y trabajo”, is unique because it allocates jobs through a lottery, which gives the opportunity to obtain for the first time robust estimates of the effects of working while studying. We plan to study effects on employment (formal and informal), earnings and education attainment combining both administrative and survey data. We will specifically focus on how young people manage to coordinate their work and study schedules, and on the effects of early work experience on the acquisition of non-cognitive skills."
