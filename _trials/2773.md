abstract: "Somalia has one of the highest levels of gender inequality in the world and most of the gender related social norms get ingrained at a very early age. To change children’s attitudes and practices around gender biases, and thereby influencing social norms, Save the Children have developed the CHOICES training model. The CHOICES training model is one of the components of their multi-component CHANGES (Challenging Harmful Attitudes and Norms for Gender Equality and Empowerment in Somalia) project with the overall goal of empowerment of women and girls leading to greater gender equality and the reduction of harmful practices, especially female genital cutting (FGC) and child marriage.

CHOICES targets changing attitudes and behaviors of very young adolescent (VYA) girls and boys aged 10-14 years towards greater gender equality in the home. The CHOICES approach seeks to encourage the development of positive, mutually respectful gender attitudes and behaviors among very younger adolescents before they become firmly entrenched in the application of gender norms with the opposite sex, therefore enabling men and women to reach their human potential.

This impact evaluation will focus on measuring the impacts of the CHOICES training model in increasing gender equality and shifting the attitudes of the boys and girls who participate in the training. The study also intends to evaluate the marginal effect of sensitizing their parents through the Engaging Men and Boys (EMB) component of the program. The World Bank’s Africa Region Gender Innovation Lab (GIL) in collaboration with Save the Children is conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) impact evaluation of the CHOICES and EMB components in seven targeted districts in Somaliland and Puntland in Somalia."
