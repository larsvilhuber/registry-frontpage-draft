abstract: "A unique feature of health care markets is that suppliers of medical services are, at least in principle, expected to behave in a patientâ€™s best interest. Such relationships require trust. We are building a novel index of trust to measure and monitor Americans' level of confidence in the public and private institutions that influence the health of individuals and communities. Our index measures both the determinants of trust (e.g., personal experience with various components of the health system) and the implications of trust (e.g., propensity to get vaccinated, schedule annual physical, etc.). Our index is informed by a novel, representative survey of Americans that we are currently conducting. Importantly, our survey over-samples minority groups such that we can study disparities in trust across traditionally underserved groups. This pre-analysis plan documents our research design, survey methodology, and connection to the trust literature.
