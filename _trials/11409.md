abstract: "Cryptocurrencies are a new form of digital money. They promote a widespread access to financial systems but are still relatively unstudied from a consumer perspective. In this survey experiment, we examine the openness of individuals to cryptocurrencies. We evaluate un-incentivized measures of the willingness to own cryptocurrencies after receiving a positive message about them. To identify key sources or topics that encourage individuals to accept cryptocurrencies, participants will be randomly placed in one of seven treatments with different messages from government agencies and popular cryptocurrency companies. Participants read the message, then answer questions regarding their willingness to open cryptocurrencies, and their perceived advantages and disadvantages. We analyze the participantsâ€™ individual willingness to own cryptocurrencies and predict that participants in treatments with increased information in messages about cryptocurrencies will lead to an increased level of willingness to own them; specifically for those who have never owned cryptocurrencies and have low knowledge of them. Through a heterogeneity analysis, we study the difference between owners and non-owners of cryptocurrencies to understand how a higher willingness to pay for cryptocurrencies can be achieved and investigate the characteristics such as age, gender, and income, that may indicate a higher willingness to owning cryptocurrencies. For an example, we expect to see that individuals whose political affiliation lies to the right of center will be less responsive to messages that come from government sources."
