abstract: "Vietnam has experienced remarkable economic success over the last decade. Incomes and living standards have grown to the extent that Vietnam achieved lower middle-income status in 2010. Growth in Vietnam has been characterized by a process of structural transformation involving a reallocation of resources from agriculture to other higher productivity sectors. An important outcome of this success story is that poverty has fallen dramatically from 57 percent, in terms of the poverty headcount ratio, in the 1990s to just 3 percent by 2010-12 (Tarp, 2016).

Recent work based on the Vietnamese Access to Resources Households Survey (VARHS) 2006-2014, however, shows that the fruits of this growth have not been evenly distributed and that many households have in fact declined in terms of welfare over the last decade (McKay and Tarp, 2016). One particularly vulnerable group is ethnic minority households. Findings from the VARHS, show that households of non-Kinh identity have fared considerably worse than Kinh households in reaping the fruits of economic prosperity over the last decade. Indeed, Singhal and Beck (2016) highlight that the disparity in income and food expenditure between non-Kinh and Kinh groups has widened between 2006 and 2014. They note, in particular, that the proportion of non-Kinh households that operate successful household enterprises is considerably smaller than Kinh households. Moreover, self-employment tends to be transitory for non-Kinh households. Given that household enterprises are an important source of income for households, particularly in rural areas where many non-Kinh households live, it is important to understand what the constraint are to non-Kinh households in establishing and growing household enterprises.

Over the last decade, a literature has emerged which focuses on how development policies can better target human behaviour. This is motivated by the recent World Development Report (World Bank, 2015) which highlights the importance of understanding human thinking in designing policies. An important component of this relates to mind-sets and aspirations. Indeed, emerging empirical research has found that by providing role models of successful individuals improves aspirations (Bernard et al., 2014) and economic outcomes (Lubega et al., 2016). There are strong arguments to suggest that the impact of such interventions may be even greater for vulnerable groups that, in general, feel marginalised from society (Lubega et al., 2016). 
In this project, we propose to explore whether shifting mind-sets and aspirations through role models can lead to more enterprise activity among ethnic minorities in Vietnam. This will be achieved by testing the extent to which a carefully designed role models intervention can impact on the extent of engagement in enterprise activities by non-Kinh households.
