abstract: "Through a randomized controlled trial, we investigate efficient strategies for encouraging household investment in preventive health technologies. In the first phase, we address information asymmetry and liquidity constraints to motivate investment in deeper wells less contaminated by arsenic. In the second phase, we adjust the participants' opportunity for strategic reporting to assess the impact of experimenter demand on investment decisions. Both intervention stages are highly relevant for policy. The initial phase tests two methods that could boost a one-time investment, yielding significant long-term economic benefits. The subsequent phase examines how a controlled trial's unique experimental features might affect the findings' external validity."
