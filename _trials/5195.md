abstract: "Research shows that reading to children promotes their cognitive development. However, parents disadvantaged by low income and low education are less likely than more advantaged parents to read to their children even though they report having books and time to read and believe that reading to their children will improve their child's life chances.

Children and Parents Engaged in Reading (CAPER) is a 6-month reading intervention that uses behavioral tools to increase the amount of time parents spend reading to their pre-school aged children, with the aim of improving children's literacy skills.

CAPER study builds on the Parents and Children Together (PACT) study (Mayer, Kalil, Oreopoulos, and Gallegos 2018), which demonstrated the ability of behavioral tools to double the amount of time that disadvantaged parents read to their preschool-aged children (effect size = 1.0 standard deviations) over a six-week intervention period. CAPER is designed to answer the following questions:

1. Can a reading intervention that incorporates behavioral tools build new reading habits in parents to such a degree that it meaningfully improves child-level outcomes?
2. Which behavioral tool is the most effective at motivating parents to read to their child and driving child-level outcomes?
3. How do the effects of behavioral tools on child outcomes vary by parent demographics?
