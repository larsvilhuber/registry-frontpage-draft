abstract: "The focus is on raising tax morale and willingness to pay among registered taxpayers for Sales Tax on Services (STS) using SMS messages that are sent out to the community on a monthly basis. As a part of the tax authority's existing SMS initiative – a reminder message is sent to the registered tax payers two days before the deadline each month reminding them of their obligation to file their tax. Any filers who have not filed by then are sent a warning SMS message regarding their failure to file. The experiment aims at behaviorally informing the existing SMS’s being utilized by the tax authority and conduct a study to understand the impact of the Reminder and Warning SMS messages on tax compliance and evaluate and recommend the most effective SMS intervention to increase sales tax compliance.
