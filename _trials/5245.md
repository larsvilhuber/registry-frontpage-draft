abstract: "The primary objective of this study is to examine how people compensate others for being unemployed and without work income. A large and related literature has examined how people are willing to mitigate inequalities caused by different factors, such as talent, luck, and effort. We complement this literature by addressing how people handle inequalities that are caused some people not being able to work at all."
