abstract: "Improving agricultural productivity is crucial for reducing poverty and strengthening food security. Over the past two decades, however, global agricultural productivity growth has slowed, primarily due to stagnation in developing countries (Fuglie et al., 2020). In these regions, challenges such as informational constraints, inadequate infrastructure, and limited governmental capacity to provide effective extension services have hindered the adoption of profitable technologies. Additionally, improper practices among farmers when adopting new technologies have further impeded agricultural growth. Our study focuses on enhancing fertilizer application in Nepal through a randomized controlled trial, aiming to improve agricultural practices and, subsequently, boost productivity and income.

Agriculture is a vital sector in Nepal, employing the majority of its population, yet it yields relatively low outputs. Compared to its neighbors, China and India, modern agricultural technologies, including fertilizers, are underutilized. Since the Green Revolution in the 1950s, fertilizers have significantly enhanced agricultural productivity in many South Asian, Southeast Asian, and Latin American countries (Carter et al., 2021; Carter et al., 2013). However, the Nepali government only began to introduce and subsidize chemical fertilizers in the early 2010s. Given this short history, many farmers lack knowledge on effective fertilizer application, leading to inefficiencies and financial waste.

In collaboration with Nepalâ€™s Ministry of Agriculture, we are designing interventions to improve fertilizer application practices among rural households. Employing a randomized controlled trial, we will rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions on enhancing agricultural practices and productivity, among other outcomes. Our study includes approximately 900 households in the Chitwan district, a major paddy rice growing area. These households are randomly divided into four roughly equal groups. One treatment group will receive a basic intervention: a customized fertilizer recommendation card based on soil test results, detailing recommended quantities, dosages, and timings. Recognizing that mere information provision may be insufficient, the second treatment group will also receive text message reminders to tackle issues of inattention and forgetfulness. Acknowledging that potential educational barriers might hinder the effectiveness of basic interventions, our third treatment group will receive both the recommendation card and access to a hotline, where agricultural experts provide consultations on issues related to fertilizer application. The fourth group will serve as a control and will not receive any intervention. We will use survey data collected before and after the intervention to evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies."
