abstract: "We study how peer effects shape authoritarianism using a field experiment in the Norwegian Armed Forces. In particular, we ask: Does random assignment to people with different levels of authoritarian orientations make soldiers more or less authoritarian? In addition, we hope to answer the following questions: How does authoritarianism change during military service? Does information about peers' authoritarian preference change individual beliefs and orientations?"
