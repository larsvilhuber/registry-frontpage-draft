abstract: "Many wealthier countries face long-term labor shortages while many poorer countries face high levels of unemployment. But migration between countries is politically difficult. Digital service export jobs, in which workers in poorer countries work remotely for firms in wealthier countries, offer a  possible route to higher employment in higher-quality jobs.  Our study relies on random assignment to causally identify the value of digital service export jobs to workers. We also study how firms can improve hiring for these jobs.  "
