abstract: "The objective of this project is to collect novel survey data aiming to capture original evidence regarding consumers’ perception, understanding and expectations about macroeconomic conditions.

The survey aims to 
•	measure macroeconomic expectations about inflation, unemployment, and interest rates 
•	understand how such expectations are influenced by the individual’s interpretation of how the macroeconomy works.

The analysis of the data from this survey will allow to pinpoint the role of different determinants of subjective expectations (such as consumer sentiment, information, and subjective interpretation of macroeconomic events) to predict consumer reactions to macroeconomic shocks. This knowledge is crucial to designing more effective policy tools that account for predictable heterogeneity in consumer behaviour based on known drivers of subjective expectations.
