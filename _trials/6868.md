abstract: "This project utilizes a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of utilizing modified introductory language to mitigate implicit bias in student evaluations of instruction. So-called "cheap talk" scripts are presented to survey respondents in advance and describe the hypothetical biases that tend to arise in the study context (Cummings and Taylor, 1999). This is potentially a highly cost-effective strategy to improve the quality of information generated by student evaluations of instruction, while also minimizing inequities for under-represented populations."
