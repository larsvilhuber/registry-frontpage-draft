abstract: "This survey experiment will study the impact on public opinion of presenting arguments for foreign aid framed in four different ways. We will test the impact both on attitudes to aid and on attitudes to other ways that more affluent countries can promote development in poorer countries.
 
1.	The first frame will describe the importance of aid in general terms. 
2.	The second frame will describe the importance of aid in helping countries respond to climate change. 
3.	The third frame will describe the importance of aid in helping countries respond to Covid-19. 
4.	The fourth frame will describe the importance of aid as a tool for helping countries respond to conflict. 

The frames will be presented to survey participants in the form information interventions: vignettes that resemble short newspaper articles.

In the analysis we will examine whether the information interventions change people’s attitudes to aid. We will also study whether the vignettes change people’s attitudes to other global issues.
