abstract: "This study aims to estimate individuals' preferences regarding the progressivity and efficiency of the Personal Income Tax (PIT). Variations in PIT designs result in differing impacts on redistribution and efficiency. While more progressive taxes achieve higher redistribution, their effects on tax revenues and economic growth remain inconclusive. To address this, we employ an experimental conjoint survey design to elicit individual preferences for regarding this trade-off.

In this experiment, participants will be presented with pairs of proposals for the design of the personal income tax and will choose their preferred option. Each proposal will provide details on different dimensions of the proposal: progressivity (marginal tax rates across six income brackets), tax revenues generated, the budgetary implications, and impact on economic growth.

This research is conducted across three countries—Spain, the USA, and Brazil—each with distinct levels of inequality, development, and importance of the welfare state.
