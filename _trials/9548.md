abstract: "In this project, we aim to test whether social norms, in particular norms around communication, hinder information transmission inside the firm. Particularly, we argue that in certain settings, higher social status individuals are unwilling to receive productivity improving information from lower social status individuals, that this dynamic is costly to the firm, and that it limits low-status individuals’ career advancement. To test these hypotheses, we collaborate with Bangladeshi knitwear factories to conduct an incentivized survey experiment to examine workers’ willingness to participate in information sharing sessions with workers of the same versus the opposite status. We also implement a field experiment in which we inject information about productivity-enhancing practices into the firm through selected high- and low-status individuals. We then study how social status affects information diffusion across workers and quantify the downstream effects on trained and untrained workers’ productivity. Finally, we explore methods to alleviate the impact of social norms on information transmission in the factory."
