abstract: "Vocational Education schools in Nepal are widespread but quality control and accreditation are lacking. As a part of the Quality Technical and Vocational Education and Training for Youth (QualiTY) project, 280 schools are to be selected to undertake an accreditation procedure, under the assumption that this will lift school quality and ultimately outcomes for graduates, especially in underprivileged groups.
To effectively evaluate the impact of the accreditation procedure, schools will be selected for treatment through a stratified randomization process, where schools are first sorted into blocks based on geographic region and school type, then randomized into treatment and control groups. Schools will complete a survey on quality measures and student outcomes at the beginning of the procedure to create a baseline measure, and will be re-interviewed annually through the course of the project, until 2026."
