abstract: "We analyze the impact of technology use in the classroom on student math learning. The technology is a software tool (electronic game) that can be installed on a tablet, smartphone, or personal computer and has been specifically designed for the student to learn and practice the four basic math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We implemented a cluster-randomized experiment: schools were randomly chosen to receive tablets with the software installed. Outcomes are measured at the individual level. Students were asked to solve a series of simple math operations before (once) and after (twice) the intervention. The outcomes are the proportion of correct answers, the proportion of items left blank, and the proportion of correct answers considering the items actually answered. As an additional component, two types of incentives (non-monetary prizes) to play harder were offered to the students: a pure incentive (winning the prize depends only on the student’s own performance) and a competitive incentive (only the best performing student of each class enters a lottery to win the prize)."
