abstract: "In this study, participants will be asked to predict and explain the effects on COVID-19 vaccine intentions from two types of information about extreme behavior to secure access to the vaccine. More precisely, participants in treatment 1 will be asked to predict and explain the effect on vaccine intentions from information about some people taking extreme actions to jump the line for the vaccines, and participants in treatment 2 will be asked to predict and explain the effect on vaccine intentions from information about so called "vaccine hunters." (Participants' predictions will later be compared to the actual outcome, i.e., results from a previous study that documents the effects on vaccine intentions from the information about the extreme behavior described in treatment 1 and 2 in the current study.)"
