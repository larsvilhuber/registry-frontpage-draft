abstract: "The linguistic-savings hypothesis (see Chen, M. K., 2013: “The Effect of Language on Economic Behavior: Evidence from Savings Rates, Health Behaviors, and Retirement Assets”, American Economic Review, 103(2), pp. 690-731) states that languages that grammatically associate the future and the present foster future-oriented behavior in terms of savings and other economic outcomes. Our study primarily investigates differences in time preferences between French and German speaking students in a secondary school in the Swiss canton of Fribourg. We conduct a pen-and-paper study with real payoffs to test (i) whether there are differences between French and German speakers in exponential discount rates (δ) and (ii) whether there are differences between French and German speakers in present bias (β), and (iii) whether the bilingual exhibit lower (larger) time discounting than French (German) speakers."
