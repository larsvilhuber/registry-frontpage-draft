abstract: "Domestic abuse (DA) is a pervasive problem worldwide.  At the same time, police responses to DA calls for service are often criticized as too little and too late.  We are working with Thames Valley Police (TVP) to implement a commendation program to reward officers for responding to domestic abuse calls and for doing so in a timely manner.  We plan to measure how the experimental commendation program affects the number of DA calls to which officers respond, the share to which they respond within the timeframe prescribed by TVP operating procedures, and the share for which the officer completes a standard risk assessment protocol.  We plan further to measure whether increased attention to DA calls results in delays in responses to other calls for service.  Finally, we intend to measure whether the intervention reduces DA recidivism."
