abstract: "Guaranteeing access to safe drinking water is still a challenge in rural households in developing countries, and unsafe water sources are responsible for millions of deaths each year around the world. In certain contexts, vouchers for free chlorine solution have been shown to be (i) a cost-effective solution to target water treatment to households with the highest need and likelihood of using chlorine and (ii) an effective way of reducing diarrhea incidence and improving child health. There is much less evidence on the impacts of using vouchers for free chlorine in contexts with both limited chlorine knowledge and exposure. 

To that end, we conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to study the effects of offering vouchers for free chlorine in public health facilities in Northern Nigeria. Northern Nigeria possesses high rates of under 5 children mortality and disease outbreaks along with very low reported awareness of chlorine among communities. In this context, we examine the impacts of a voucher program on child health outcomes, including caretaker-reported diarrhea, fever, and cough incidence. We also examine several implementation outcomes including the rate of voucher redemption, frequency of health visits, chlorine usage rates as well as health staff acceptance and engagement. We monitor the program's impact in at least ten public health facilities in Kano State, one of the Nigerian states with the highest under 5 children mortality.
