abstract: "Walking 10k steps a day has relevant benefits for health and is feasible for the vast majority of people. Moreover, walking is the most sustainable way to move. The project aims to test the effectiveness of specific messages on the steps subjects walk. These messages are built based on behavioral features which can be useful in increasing the number of steps made: sunk cost as a self-management device, social comparison, and inter-temporal comparison. We want to test if these messages can be superior to standard reminders in the short and long run. Subjects will be randomized to receive a standard reminder or messages that use behavioral tools. We will also collect data about subjects who do not receive any reminders. Duration of the exposition to the message will vary from 1 to 3 weeks to test time effects. Data will be collected using an app and the experiment aims to involve 20000 users."
