abstract: "Loans to purchase new assets sometimes use the new assets themselves as collateral, as in car or home loans in the developed world. Other loans—especially in developing countries —instead require using existing assets as collateral. We hypothesize that the endowment effect (Kahneman et al. 1990) causes consumers to dislike placing existing assets at risk by promising them as collateral. This might drive down take-up of loans collateralized using existing assets, relative to collateralizing with new assets (which may not yet have entered the reference point). The proposed project will test this mechanism using a randomized experiment in Kenya. A secondary goal will be to test whether borrowers anticipate that new assets might themselves eventually enter the reference point, becoming subject to an endowment effect. Our findings will shed light on psychological factors affecting demand for financing, and on the welfare implications of loans collateralized using new assets."
