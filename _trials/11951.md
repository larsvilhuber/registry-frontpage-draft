abstract: "The digital revolution is impacting every aspect of life, and the agricultural sector is also undergoing a process of digitization. Among these advancements, remote irrigation control is a fundamental requirement for digitalized irrigation. Currently, there is extensive research on digital agriculture, but most of it is centered around the use of smartphones, with very little attention given to digitalized irrigation. What is the actual adoption of digitalized irrigation in practice? Is it mainly through the use of remote controllers or a combination of special applications in smartphones? Who are the potential future users? What type of remote irrigation control do they prefer? Is equipment cost the primary consideration for farmers?

This study aims to answer the above questions by conducting surveys on real farmers and use information treatment of remote irrigation control (RIC) in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Hebei Province of China, covering approximately 500 large farmers, to find the casual relationship between cost, technology and willingness to pay (WTP) for the RIC.
