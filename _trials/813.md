abstract: "This document describes the analysis plan for a randomized experiment examining the psychological effects of poverty on cooperation, trust, negative reciprocity and altruistic punishment. We will recruit respondents from Amazon Mechanical Turk. We will run two separate experiments in which we expose our treatment group to a prime that triggers feelings of poverty Mani et al. (2013). In each experiment we recruit 972 participants. In the first experiment we examine the effect of poverty primes on behavior in a public goods game and the behavior of a first mover in a trust game. In the second experiment we explore the consequences of feeling poor on the behavior of the second mover in a ultimatum game and on the behavior of the punisher in a third-party punishment game. This plan outlines the design of the experiments, the outcomes of interest, the econometric approach and the dimensions of heterogeneity we intend to explore.
