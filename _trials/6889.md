abstract: "In this study, we analyze the political and economic consequences of the (mis)management of the Covid-19 crisis. With this objective, we plan to implement a number of large-scale online experiments conducted to a representative sample of the Spanish population. Spain is one of the most severely affected countries by the Covid-19 pandemic, both in terms of the public health crisis and the expected economic downturn. 

Our main research question is to study how providing information about the importance and the quality of the public management of the crisis and about the difference in management of the crisis across Spanish regions affect trust in institutions, support for extremist parties, polarization, and compliance with the rules, among other political attitudes.
