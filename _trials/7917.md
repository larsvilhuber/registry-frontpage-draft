abstract: "In this study is a (qualitative) replication of the disjunction effect in the prisoners' dilemma (PD) documented by Shafir and Tversky (1992). In a between-subjects design, participants play a one-shot PD either in simultaneous-move form or as second-movers is a sequential PD. I test the null hypothesis that cooperation among simultaneous-movers is no higher than in the highest-cooperation group of second-movers (those facing either cooperation or rejection) against the one-sided alternative hypothesis that it is higher than in both of these groups, as was found by Shafir and Tversky (1992)."
