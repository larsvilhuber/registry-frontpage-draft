abstract: "
In this study, we will test whether a communication strategy designed to encourage female candidates who are eligible to apply for management positions can reduce the gender gap in school management.  Our setting is Peru’s Concurso de Acceso 2022 (henceforth, contest). This is a centralized system for allocating school management positions.  While all eligible candidates will receive the same number of messages, women in the treatment arm will receive more detailed text messages designed to encourage them to apply for the contest. In addition to the standard information, these text messages will provide information designed to encourage them to apply (e.g. emphasizing that they meet the requirements, providing examples of women who were hired in previous contests, or quotes about a women’s children being proud of her after being hired).
