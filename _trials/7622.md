abstract: "More evidence shows that public movement can promote voting turnout in the following election. This paper wishes to go further with these findings to answer how people’s experience of public participation affects their voting behavior. We develop a two-stage lab experiment to test what factors in public participation mainly change people’s voting behavior. In the first stage, subjects participate in threshold public good games in different settings including low threshold, communication and opinion leader. Then, in the second stage, every subject has to decide whether to vote. We can thus observe people’s voting behavior with various participation experiences. Our initial result shows that low threshold is easier to reach than the baseline and thus subjects in this treatment have more experiences of success. However, such successful experience does not promote voting rate. Communication and opinion leader also creates more successful experience for subjects and effectively promote voting turnout. We believe communication and opinion leader are factors that mainly influence people’s voting behavior, while pure successful experiences have nearly no effect."
