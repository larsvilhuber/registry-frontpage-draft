abstract: "We will conduct a comprehensive survey targeting an online sample of the U.S. population to assess their preferences for police engagement in specific issues or scenarios. Survey participants will be randomly assigned to view brief informational videos that outline various degrees of alternative resources to traditional policing in the United States. In a follow-up survey, we will investigate changes in the propensity to use 911 versus 988 for a suicidal ideation scenario, assessing whether informational exposure can sustainably modify behavior."
