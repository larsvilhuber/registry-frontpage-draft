abstract: "The effect of political endorsement on the endorser is under0studied. How do political endorsements made by scientific organizations affect (1) public trust in the endorsing organization, (2) demand for scientific information provided by the endorsing organization, (3) trust in scientific expertise in genera;? How do the effects vary by participants' prior beliefs about the political issues that are the subject of the endorsement?
I investigate these question by conducting an online experiment treating participants with information about the scientific journal Nature's endorsement of Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, when the COVID-19 pandemic, which the endorsement statement highlights, was an extremely salient issue. I then examine participants' stated trust in Nature, demand for COVID-19 related information from Nature, as well as receptiveness toward Nature's scientific communication unrelated to COVID-19. I focus on how effects differ by participants' prior views about Biden vs. Trump.
I structure my analyses with a simple model of information communication with repetitional concerns. "
