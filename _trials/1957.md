abstract: "Today's students face many pressures vying to capture their attention, and undergraduate curricula increasingly rely on self-directed content exposure that occurs outside of the traditional classroom. This combination may tend to exacerbate behavioral failures inhibiting human capital production. In this study, we propose to randomize over 500 students across several sections of a standardized, mixed-format (hybrid) introductory economics course taught at a large, public, urban university into treatment arms to receive different types of either motivations or monitoring interventions throughout the semester. These interventions will be provided in electronic (e-mail) format and sent uniquely to students with information pertinent to their study habits and learning process. We will utilize both administrative data, standardized test outcomes, and detailed microdata of student study habits captured by the online content publisher to measure the effect of the intervention on study habits as well as the return to online study."
