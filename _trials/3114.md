abstract: "While the Indian government administers many welfare programs for the poor, program coverage is often low as eligible households lack the knowledge and the means to navigate the complex and costly application processes. In this evaluation, we investigate the potential of leveraging technology and private-public partnerships to improve access to state goods and services. Our interventions will build on an existing model called Haqdarshak, which comprises of paid door-to-door services offered by a community level facilitator to citizens to inform them of the programs they are eligible for and help them apply for these programs. We will offer this services to 10,000 vulnerable households in rural villages of Rajasthan. 

In particular, we will randomize (1) the price of the services, (2) messages warning against the provision of false information in screening and application and (3) facilitator type. Key research questions of the study include: whether a non-state, private actor can play a sustainable role in promoting awareness of and access to government programs; how do citizens engage with this type of intermediary and what is the demand for the different types of services offered; and does the magnitude and composition of beneficiaries change using this model by bringing more vulnerable groups into state systems."
