abstract: "We provide descriptions of fictive high schools to a large sample of Danish high-school teachers and ask them to rate the outcome attainment of the presented schools. 

Within each description, we randomly assign a number of different pieces information about outcomes: socioeconomic mobility, wellbeing, and transition to higher education. In addition, we provide teachers with information about schools' "production attributes", i.e. the inputs and outputs preceding outcomes. 

For organizational inputs, we use two sets of wordings related to student backgrounds—one tied to student origin (e.g., “Has a high proportion of students with a non-Western background.”) and the other linked to parents’ educational background (e.g., “Has a high proportion of parents without higher education.”). 

For organizational outputs, we use two distinct sets of wordings—one focusing on past efforts (e.g., “Has implemented many initiatives to improve quality in the past year.”) and the other on potential future efforts (e.g., “Significant focus on developing the teaching in the future.”).
