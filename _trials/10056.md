abstract: "With rapidly increasing healthcare costs, both governments and firms are paying more attention to cultivating healthy lifestyles among consumers to reduce medical and financial burdens. However, consumer often struggle to fulfil their commitments to health-related goals, such as consistently going to the gym. This research examines the effects of financial and non-financial incentives on consumers’ gym-going behaviors. We conduct a set of randomized field experiments in partnership with the campus recreation center at one of the largest U.S. public universities that garners around one million student, staff, and faculty visits each year. Specifically, we provide a set of financial and non-financial incentives to the members of the center and track their progress (i.e., number and types of workouts completed). Our preliminary results show that financial incentives have a significant and sustained effect on members’ workout completion. We also examine the effects of non-financial incentives, such as information about the workouts and individual’s ranks among peers. "
