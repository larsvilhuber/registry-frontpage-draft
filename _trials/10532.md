abstract: "Under-nutrition and its associated effects cause a wide range of effects across the life course, and constitute a major threat to health and human capital in India. As children transition from breastfeeding to complementary feeding, feeding frequency and quantity changes rapidly and it is hard to establish. This ‘food accounting’ problem makes it hard to track what is fed to a child and how much, when the child was fed prior to planning a next meal, and to adequately increase amounts as the child grows, leading to inadequate feeding practices. This study seeks to address behavioral bottlenecks that inhibit complementary feeding practices. A food journal intended to aid habit formation, in particular with regard to dietary diversity, will be given to mothers of children 6-20m by front line health workers using a cluster randomized control design, where Anganwadi centers (front-line nutrition centers) in the study areas will be randomized to the status quo or to deliver food journals to mothers of age-eligible children. Mothers will be followed and their nutrition knowledge and feeding practices assessed at endline. Children will have their middle-upper arm circumference (MUAC) measured as an indicator of nutritional status.
