abstract: "In this study, we plan to analyze the political and economic consequences of the unequal burden of the Covid-19 crisis across Spanish households. With this objective, we plan to conduct a number of large-scale online experiments conducted to a representative sample of the Spanish population. Spain is one of the most severely affected countries by the Covid-19 pandemic, both in terms of the public health crisis and the expected economic downturn. 

We plan to focus on three main research questions. First, we will study how informing people about the economic crisis caused by the covid-19 pandemic affects beliefs and political attitudes. Second, we will study to what extent receiving information about policies that strengthen safety nets affects political attitudes. Third, we will study the interaction between these two issues. In particular, we will study how information about policies mediates on the effects of the economic crises on attitudes.
