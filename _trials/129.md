abstract: "We implement a randomized trial activating the use of job search via networks for a set of 4700 job seekers in Switzerland. Information was randomized on the level of mandatory information meetings. We collect supplementary information on reservation wages, job search strategies, and some psychological measures. We find activating job seekers to contact their professional network helps women and highly skilled individuals to find jobs more quickly. Activation does not produce effects on job search for men and low skilled individuals. We discuss the relevance of potential explanations using information on a survey administered to all job seekers leaving unemployment during the observation period."
