abstract: "In the first part of the project, we studied in a controlled experiment how a representative group of adults in Shanghai make distributive choices for children, and how their choices vary with the age of the children. The experimental design allowed us to identify causally how adults' distributive choices depend on the age of the children, shedding light on how a society treats children of different ages. In the second part of the project, we plan to recruit children in the same age groups to make the same set of distributive decisions for children their own age. Taken together, the two parts of the study will allow us to investigate how adults make distribute choices for children at different ages, and how this corresponds to the distributive choices made by children in the same age groups. The present pre-analysis plan presents the data sources, the structure of the experiment, and the empirical strategy for the second part of the project."
