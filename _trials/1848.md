abstract: "Monitoring workers in order to match rewards to performance is a central justification for the importance of organizations and of management. However, when both inputs and outputs are difficult to measure, achieving this objective is difficult. We consider whether signaling and demonstrating monitor productivity on some performance dimensions leads to an improvement in worker performance on all dimensions. Preliminary results from a field experiment run among remote multi-dimensional task workers in rural Kenya demonstrate that increasing the visibility of monitoring on some dimensions improves performance on most of those dimensions, as well as performance on others. Our evidence is consistent with this monitoring acting as a signal of managerial productivity."
