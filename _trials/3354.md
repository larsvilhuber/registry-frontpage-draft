abstract: "Does providing consumers with information about discounts help them realize more savings? We address this question using data from a field experiment on a website for online grocery shopping. Our results illustrate the difficulty in using information provision to steer shoppers towards cheaper alternatives (of equal or higher quality than their substitutes). We find that providing (treatment) shoppers with promotional information on sale categories increases the probability of purchasing within the category. This effect is driven by an increase in purchasing rates for both the reduced priced items and regularly priced substitutes. Our analysis focuses on understanding how item placement, promotional information, and the way promotional information is displayed impact consumer choices in a multi-product environment where prices are changing."
