abstract: "We study how exogenous variation in geographic mobility affects people’s beliefs and their identity. We combine a unique natural experiment, the random assignment of male conscripts to different locations throughout spain, with unique survey data on preferences, beliefs and identity. We study whether being randomly assigned to com- plete the military service outside of one’s region of residence has a long-lasting im- pact on people’s sense of national identity and their beliefs. In this pre-analyis plan we specify (i) our main empirical specifications, (ii) the set of outcomes we plan to analyze, (iii) the sample size and sample inclusion criteria, (iv) power calculations based on pilot data, (v) adjustment for multiple hypothesis testing, and (vi) the exact experimental instructions used."
