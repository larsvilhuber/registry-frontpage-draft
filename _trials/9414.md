abstract: "There is ample evidence that the sharing economy discriminates against minorities. The situation of families in the sharing economy, however, has been largely neglected. In this research, we want to examine if families suffer from discrimination.
Specifically, we want to contact vacation rental hosts asking if it is possible to rent an apartment. The control groups are a couple, a couple with one, two, or three friends.  In the treatment group a couple has one, two, or
three kids. Additionally, we want to analyze if signaling the childrenâ€™s ability increases the chances of receiving a response for
families. "
