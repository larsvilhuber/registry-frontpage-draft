abstract: "The African Health Markets for Equity (AHME) Impact Evaluation aims to rigorously evaluate the extent to which transforming the business model of franchised healthcare providers and expanding access to demand-side financing generates effective and cost-effective coverage of priority technologies and interventions amongst the poor. The evaluation is a collaborative effort between Innovations for Poverty Action and researchers from multiple institutions, and is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (DFID). The AHME intervention package will seek to improve efficiencies in private health care delivery by reducing both supply-side and demand-side constraints. Specifically, supply-side intervention will include (1) the social franchising of private clinics in order to improve consistency and quality of care and to reduce costs and (2) quality monitoring linked to capital financing in order to help clinics expand and improve clinical services. On the demand side, AHME interventions, such as vouchers, health insurance schemes and medical savings accounts will be integrated into the AHME package in later years to reduce financial barriers to accessing provider services. In addition opportunities to improve the operational efficiency of supply and/or demand-side financing interventions using information and communication technology (ICT) interventions will be explored. 

The AHME intervention package will be evaluated using a randomized control trial (RCT) design. The RCT will be designed to measure the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the AHME model (franchising, supply-side financing and demand-side financing) at improving quality of care, service utilization, access to high-quality care, and health outcomes. Clinics will be screened for eligibility during baseline data collection. Using criteria established by the AHME implementing partners, clinics will be grouped by how likely they are to be eligible for the AHME package of interventions. Clinics in top eligibility tiers (those most likely to be eligible for the package of AHME interventions) will be randomly assigned a number to determine the order in which they will be approached for recruitment into AHME. Random assignment will be stratified by county and eligibility tier. The top half of the list will be assigned to the treatment group (clinics that should be approached for recruitment to the AHME package immediately) and the control group (clinics that will be recruited after the completion of the AHME evaluation). The random number assigned to each clinic will also determine the order in which clinics will be approached within both treatment and controls arms. Subsequent interventions (i.e., demand-side financing and information and communication technology interventions) will be randomly allocated in a similar fashion. Data will be collected over a 4 year period at both the clinic and household level to measure healthcare utilization and quality of care, clinic financial outcomes, and child health outcomes. Outcomes will be compared between treatment and control clinics to estimate impacts of the overall AHME package. Cost-effectiveness analyses will also conducted
