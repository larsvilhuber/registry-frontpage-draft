abstract: "Women are less likely than men to enter competitions but we do not know how stable such preferences are. We test if competitiveness changes from before to after an 8-week boot camp in a traditionally male setting, the Norwegian Armed Forces (NAF). This plan describes the hypotheses to be tested and how we will test them. It includes a description of how variables will be coded, how we will deal with missing values, and the specification of the estimation equations. All deviations from the plan will be highlighted in the final paper."
