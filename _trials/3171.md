abstract: "Guatemala's Quality of Life Survey consistently demonstrates that indigenous girls have very steep declines in school enrollment at the onset of adolescence. Enrollment also declines among indigenous boys during this period, but not nearly as rapidly as girls. Previous research suggests that parental expectations and social norms play a role in this drop. This study features a cluster randomized control trial that measures the impact of a safe spaces, mentoring and life skills curriculum intervention designed to change behavior, knowledge and attitudes associated with early dropout and other negative life outcomes. For this, we track 1,200 girls aged 12 to 17 living in rural indigenous communities in the highlands of Guatemala for a period of 12 months. The study tests for impact on school enrollment as a primary outcome and early marriage and pregnancy, life skills, and sexual reproductive health knowledge and gender norms as secondary outcomes.
