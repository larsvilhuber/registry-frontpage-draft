abstract: "We conduct a randomized controlled trial to understand how to improve the efficiency of air conditioning use among households in the southern regions in China. First, we collect data on how households used air conditioning in the past 12 months based on self-reports. Then one monitor is installed on each air conditioner in the households to collect data documenting the real use of air conditioners in the household. We would evaluate whether giving them information and how information is given could improve the use of air conditioners. "
