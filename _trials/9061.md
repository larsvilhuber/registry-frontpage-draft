abstract: "Not all qualified students apply to grammar school, the college-bound secondary school track, also called the grammar school track, where gifted students can effectively unfold their talent. The mismatch between the qualified students and the secondary school track dedicated for these students might be a consequence of meritocratic application regimes. 

In meritocratic application regimes of selective educational systems, schools select students based on students’ prior achievement. Consequently, the fear of being refused from a school might deter students from applying to that school. This fear might intensify for applying schools at the grammar school track, the most selective secondary track with the highest admission standards. Schools’ admission standards –especially how students perceive it – might stand behind students’ fear of not being admitted. 

Schools’ exact admission standards are unknown to students. Therefore, students might hold biased information about their subjective admission chances at a given school which could result in not to apply grammar schools. Correcting the information bias and informing qualified students about schools’ actual admission standards might increase the subjective admission chance of these qualified students, who in turn might apply to the grammar school track more likely.

We conduct a pair-matched, cluster-randomized field experiment in which we reveal schools’ actual admission standards to qualified students. We hypothesize that revealing to qualified students the schools’ last-year admission standards increases treated students’ application to grammar schools.
