abstract: "Fatwas, a ruling on a point of Islamic law given by a recognized authority, are important moral guidelines for Muslims around the world. While economists acknowledge that religious rules can influence individual and collective behaviors, there is still little rigorous evidence on the impact of religious rulings on health behavior. More specifically, the cognitive processes underlying the link between Islamic religious ruling and health behavior is not yet well understood. 
Our study context is Indonesia – the country with the largest Muslim population globally. With over one third of the population smoking, smoking still represents an important public health concern. In 2010, one of the country’s most important Islamic organization – Muhammadiyah –issued to an anti-smoking fatwa in order to address this issue. In this study we explore the effects of this ruling.  We employ five distinct online experiments that involve a total of 14,500 individuals, in order to better understand an individual’s cognitive processes related to smoking. More specifically, we investigate (i) the role of information uptake and avoidance, (ii) motivated reasoning and storing of information, and (iii) cognitive strategies in dealing with challenging information.
