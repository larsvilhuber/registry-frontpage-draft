abstract: "The USAID-funded Strengthening Health Outcomes through the Private Sector (SHOPS) project, together with the University of Michigan, is conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the impact of family planning counseling methods designed to change attitudes and behaviors related to use of modern contraceptives among married women in Jordan. 

The SHOPS project in Jordan (locally known as the Strengthening Family Planning project) has been implementing a comprehensive community health outreach program designed to specifically address one of the most difficult programmatic challenges in family planning: changing attitudes and behaviors among women with the highest unmet need. Under the project, community health workers make home visits to married women of reproductive age across Jordan to discuss the benefits and options of modern family planning methods as well as provide referrals for family planning. Given the important role of husbands in family planning decision-making (DHS data and available qualitative evidence), the project is implementing a pilot outreach program where couples are counseled as well. 

The main objectives of this research are to (1) measure the impact of counseling women on family planning uptake, (2) measure the impact of counseling couples on family planning decisions and uptake as compared to counseling women alone, and (3) identify the mechanisms (spousal communication, bargaining power, fertility preferences, etc.) through which counseling - either alone or as a couple - affects family planning use. After a screening exercise to identify study eligible households and a baseline survey, women are randomly assigned to three groups: counseling alone, counseling with their husbands, or no counseling. Outreach visits by the community health workers and a detailed endline survey are then conducted to measure differences in family planning uptake between the three groups. 

The study is among the first to measure the effect of husband's involvement on family planning use in an Arab country, where important contextual factors related to fertility decision making within a household or a couple may lead to different results than in other settings.
