abstract: "Data Exchange (DEX) is the Department of Social Services (DSS) in Australiaâ€™s new approach to collecting and storing programme performance data.  It will shift the focus of performance measurement from outputs to more meaningful information about service delivery outcomes. A DEX survey is offered to clients both at the beginning and end of their service.

The aim of the study is to examine whether using behavioural insights techniques can improve the data collection rate for DEX, which in turn will assist DSS with evaluating service delivery outcomes. "
