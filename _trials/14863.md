abstract: "While most livelihoods in developing countries depend on small businesses and smallholder agriculture, farmers and micro-entrepreneurs often lack the necessary financial management knowledge and skills to manage their businesses successfully and earn adequate incomes. We propose a rigorous impact evaluation of the Business Games, a simulation-based, three-day training program for farmers and micro-entrepreneurs, in Zambia. The Business Games aim to help farmers and micro-entrepreneurs develop their financial knowledge and skills, farm and business management practices, and ultimately their livelihoods and employment outcomes. The features of the intervention allow our study to provide evidence on the effects of a skills training intervention (i) in Southern Africa, a region where newer evidence is lacking, (ii) a skills training intervention that is low-cost and innovative, an area where further evidence is needed, and (iii) an intervention based on the psychologically well-founded experiential learning approach, which has not yet been evaluated rigorously.
