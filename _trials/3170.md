abstract: "We test experimentally whether agents are loss averse when they compete in a real-effort (real time/simultaneous) competition against a Robot that runs in randomly varying speeds. Human and Robot count the number of ‘G’ letters in their texts and place ‘Green’ block in the corresponding bin. Following Gill-Prowse (2012), The probability of winning a predetermined prize increases/decreases by 1% per unit difference between Human and Robot points. We hypothesize that an agent who is loss averse around her endogenous expectations-based reference point will respond negatively to the Robot’s performance level."
