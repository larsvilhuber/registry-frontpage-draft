abstract: "Background: Lateral elbow tendinopathy is a frequently encountered upper extremity dysfunctions in clinical practice. prolonged symptoms or relapse upon return to the offending activity represent  one of the health care challenges. Objective. to evaluate the effectiveness of neural mobilization versus low level laser therapy on chronic Lateral elbow tendinopathy. Design. The study was designed as a single blind randomized controlled trial. Setting: The study was conducted in the outpatient clinic of the faculty of Physical Therapy, Cairo University. Patients. Sixty patients with unilateral chronic Lateral elbow tendinopathy were randomly assigned to control group (n=20),  neural mobilization group (n=20), and laser group (n=20).Intervention. control group received ultrasound therapy and deep friction massage. The  neural mobilization intervention consisted of radial nerve mobilization for the affected arm 3sessions per week  up to 6 weeks. Meanwhile laser group received (904 Ga-As laser, energy density 2.4 J/cm2). Outcome measures were the visual analog scale (VAS), the disability of arm, shoulder and hand questionnaire (DASH score), and hand grip strength .Measurements. Analyses of variance test was used to determine differences between groups for all measured parameters.  Paired t-test was used to compare between the pre- and post-treatment values within groups.Results. For the 60 study participants (26 women and 34 men; mean age=39.3Â±6.2) years there were no between-group differences at baseline in VAS, Dash score, and grip strength . At the end of the 6-week of intervention,  Subjects in mobilization and laser groups experienced significant decrease in pain and improve in function disability than those in the control group (p>0.05) . Pain and functional disability were significantly improved in mobilization group compared with the laser group, while there was no significant difference in grip strength between three groups (p>0.05).Limitations. Lack of a cost-benefit analysis and follow up analysis were limitations of the study. Discussion and Conclusion. The results suggest that neural mobilization could be effective treatment option for management of low level laser when pain and functional disability are the main patient complains."
