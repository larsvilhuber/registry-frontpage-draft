abstract: "This study will run a randomised control trial on electric vehicle users in the UK. We will have access to a pool of approximately 450,000 electroverse customers. Of these customers, approximately our sample will be the approximately 120,0000 users resident in the UK (where the trial takes place) who (as of 19 December 2024) have their device language set to English, have push notifications enabled, and have not opted out of receiving price plunge notifications. These customers will be exposed to one of four treatments: 
1. Control: will receive no notifications about price plunge events; 
2. Moral suasion: will receive a notification encouraging them to take advantage of hours with green electricity to charge their EV; 
3. Low discount group: will receive notifications informing them that they will receive a discount of 15% during price plunge event hours; and 
4. High discount group: will receive notifications informing them that they will receive a discount of 40% during price plunge event hours. 
The specific times specified in the push notifications (i.e., “9pm-11pm”) will be exactly the same for all groups 2, 3, and 4. 
Customers will be randomised into groups, each of which receives a sequence of treatments in a partial “Latin Squares” structure as part of a crossover randomisation design. There will be wash-out periods of 1 week between crossovers. "
