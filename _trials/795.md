abstract: "This paper describes the analysis plan for a randomized experiment examining the effect of poverty on anti-sociality. This study aims to identify the extent to which poverty, through individual cognition and decision making, can influence behavior typically classified as anti-social (dishonesty, aggression, etc.). We simulate poverty in the lab by inducing a priming effect which makes salient psychological states as- sociated with poverty. We observe anti-social behavior with a battery of tasks and questionnaires selected to obtain a broad measure of anti-sociality. We conducted this experiment with a sample of 120 respondents from the city of Trenton, NJ and its sur- rounding communities. This plan outlines our outcomes of interest and econometric approach."
