abstract: "The pastoralist regions of Northern Kenya have seen a number of interventions intended to address the deep poverty and the extreme vulnerability with which it is intertwined. This research examines two of those interventions that have recently received a great deal of public support and recognition.Index Based Livestock Insurance (IBLI) Asset Protection Program, which developed a satellite-based index that triggers payouts to households that experience climatic shocks, allowing them to protect their assets. Rural Entrepreneur Access Project (REAP) Asset Transfer (or Graduation) Program, which transfers and helps poor women build a suite of tangible and intangible (or psychological) assets.

While there is evidence that both programs are individually effective in the short to medium term, the programs have the potential to complement each other and in combination offer a package that fundamentally alters poverty in the region. Having secured the cooperation of the program implementers, the research proposed here will test the efficacy of this package and how best and most cost-effectively to assemble it.The primary objectives of the proposed research are to (1) measure the impact of each of Rural Entrepreneur Access Project (REAP) graduation program and Index Based Livestock Insurance (IBLI) on the extent and depth of poverty at the community level in Samburu North in northern Kenya, and (2) compare that to the impacts of a package that combines both interventions."
