abstract: "In this document, we provide the research design and analysis plan for evaluating the impact of information dissemination through a documentary film that educates the ethnically dominant Bengalis about the ethnic minority Santals in Bangladeshi polyethnic villages. We want to evaluate whether exposure to information affects behavior and opinions of the ethnic majority towards minorities. More importantly, we want to test whether information diffusion is stronger when it is targeted to network-central ethnic majorities. We will measure outcomes using survey questions, administrative data, lab-in-the-field experiments, and a field experiment."
