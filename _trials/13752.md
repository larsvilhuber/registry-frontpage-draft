abstract: "European countries that have introduced electronic health records (in German mostly known as "elektronische Patientenakten", in Italian as the "Fascicolo Sanitario Elettronico" and in English is also known as an electronic medical record) have typically set up opt-in systems, where each individual decides whether to exercise the option to have an EHRs set up for him- or herself, or, if the EHR is set up by default, must pro-actively opt-in(to) the specific features or functions that make an EHR useful from a medical care and public health perspective.  Opt-in rates, however, have remained far below expectations (and certainly below the level hoped for) by most experts – and below the levels required to yield the hoped-for benefits for advances in evidence-based medicine and public health.  A wealth of behavioral research suggests that, given the pervasive "default bias", rates of sign-up/participation should be substantially higher if everyone is set up with an EHR with the opportunity to opt-out than if the EHR is merely offered for opt-in.  Policymakers at the national and at the EU level are therefore considering making full-functionality EHRs the default for all, with the option to opt-out.  There are concerns, however, that opt-out-based EHRs will be perceived as unwelcome paternalism or even as outright attempts to manipulate patients/citizens, undermining or even inverting the default bias.  In a survey experiment that allows for differentiated findings for 13 key features of EHRs, we examine to what extent setting up (or switching to) an opt-out EHR would result in such reactance (pushback against this attempt to nudge EHRs acceptance) that might counteract the hoped-for default bias and/or result in lower-quality data."
