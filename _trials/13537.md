abstract: "We conduct a survey experiment to study how information on a job’s work/life balance affects students’ beliefs about a job’s non-wage amenities. In the survey, students are asked to read a description of the pros and cons of going into management consulting. We randomize students to receive a description either with or without information on work/life balance. We then elicit students' beliefs about two non-wage amenities related to work/life balance.
