abstract: "Safety concerns are high in emerging economies and limited governmental resources are scarce to make sure firms comply with rules in place.  We measure the impact of traditional safety visits by inspectors and of online training sessions and their combination with.  We do so in 3 different states in Brazil in a sector that has high rates of accidents (manufacturing of machines). We measure the impact of these interventions on safety outcomes as well as workers’ wages and well-being.  This would provide us with the first experimental measure of the impact of safety visit in a developing country and allow us to compare it to a lower-cost type of intervention where firms and workers are more involved which would help us understand the nature of the barriers to workers’ safety in developing countries.
