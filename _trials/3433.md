abstract: "We investigate whether providing individualized labor market information helps long-term job seekers find employment. Our sample will consist of job seekers that have been unemployed for at least 2 years and that are entering a job search assistance programme offered by a private company. A significant share may have a disability or health condition. These individuals use a standard job search portal to find and track jobs of interest. A random subset will be offered an enhanced version of the portal that offers suggestions for alternative occupations based on the individualâ€™s preference for particular occupations. The enhanced portal also offers additional resources to find relevant occupations in case the job seeker has no preferred occupations."
