abstract: "Manufacturing can provide high-paying jobs for workers in low-income countries, but health issues or caretaking often drive workers (especially women) out of the labor force.  Paid sick leave can prevent the spread of disease and keep workers in the workforce, but workers often fear retribution for taking sick leave. We are conducting a stratified, cluster-randomized experiment in collaboration with a large garment manufacturing firm in Bangladesh.   All workers receive a phone survey in which they are reminded that their responses will be kept private; treated workers will receive an additional message over the phone: treatment (1) provides a message that the firm cares about their health, (2) provides treatment 1 + a message that respondents are entitled to sick leave and (3) provides treatment 2 + information about recourses if a request for sick leave is denied. 

We will estimate the effects of treatment on workersâ€™ reported health (mental and physical), job satisfaction, and absenteeism.  Reported health and job satisfaction will be asked after the health messaging in the phone survey. We will also conduct a follow-up survey 2 to 3 weeks after the initial survey, which will provide the information on absenteeism.  We will also re-measure health and job satisfaction to assess whether any changes in these outcomes are persistent.
