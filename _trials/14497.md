abstract: "Ethiopia has one of the highest rates of under-five child malnutrition globally, with a high prevalence of stunting, underweight, and wasting. The country's high prevalence of under-five child malnutrition limits better nutrition and health outcomes in children. Studies show that an innovative Family MUAC tape approach can significantly reduce the high malnutrition rates as mothers are empowered to screen their children for early detection and treatment instead of relying only on health workers. This innovative approach has also been shown to be cost-effective while increasing coverage. Ethiopia has adopted the approach as it strives to reduce malnutrition rates. While the approach has been shown to be effective, there is a lack of evidence on how training formats and supervision can lead to caregivers' knowledge retention, hence the sustainability of the approach in the long term. This pilot will be conducted within the SPIR II (Strengthen PSNP5 Institutions and Resilience) Program and aims to provide evidence on improving the early detection and prevention of acute malnutrition in rural Ethiopia as well as empowering caregivers and improving program coverage in the SPIR II Operational Woredas of Oromia and Amhara Regions. This will be a one-year study, where the caregivers will be randomly selected to participate in the program. The specific objectives are: 1) To investigate how periodic on-job Family MUAC training and supportive supervision impact the knowledge retention and accuracy of caregivers' detection skills of acute malnutrition; and 2) To assess the impact of Family MUAC on increasing early detection and self-referral of acute malnutrition."
