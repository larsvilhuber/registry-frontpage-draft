abstract: "Toys play a crucial role in every individual's early years. In developing countries, children often make do with makeshift playthings like plastic cans, stones, and chalk, while their counterparts in developed countries engage with commercially manufactured toys. Despite toys being a prominent aspect of children's lives, we have limited knowledge about their impact on developmental outcomes. To bridge this gap, we conduct a study to examine the effects of educational toys on the cognitive and non-cognitive development of children. We randomly distribute educational toys to kindergartens and assess their influence on 3 and 4-years-old children."
