abstract: "This project aims to investigate the relationship between the cost of a job application, from the viewpoint of the jobseeker, and match quality. The main mechanism we wish to investigate is self-selection into the decision to apply for a job. When jobs vary in their cost of application, we hypothesize that different types of people will self-select into applying for the position depending on their relative cost of effort and/or their outside options, which in turn impacts match quality. 

We run an experiment on the online task matching platform, Prolific, where we invite jobseekers to apply for short-term work and randomly vary both the time and effort costs associated with submitting an application. We hypothesize that a jobseeker who is a good "fit" for a position will incur a lower cost of effort to submit an application. However, high ability jobseekers also have a higher degree of outside options and may be less willing to undertake applications with higher costs as a result. We measure the overall impact on match quality, as proxied by task performance. "
