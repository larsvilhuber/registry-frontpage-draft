abstract: "The  often  observed  wedge  between  statutory  policies  and  on-the-ground enforcement practices in low-income countries for the taxation of small, informal  firms  may  stem  from  an  asymmetry  of  information  about  the  law.   We test this hypothesis in a randomized controlled trial in Lome, Togo by training firms  about  the  tax  code  and  assessing  the  effect  on  their  tax  participation and economic activities.  We find that tax participation decreased, driven bylow-revenue firms,  and  their economic  activities expanded.  Overall tax  revenues  increased,  suggesting  that  aggressive  taxation  under  asymmetric  civicinformation is likely regressive and counterproductive for firmsâ€™ activities andgovernment revenues."
