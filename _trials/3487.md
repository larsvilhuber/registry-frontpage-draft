abstract: "Starting from Niederle and Vesterlund (2007), a large number of lab experiments report that men are more likely to enter tournaments. We aim to test whether advising women to compete more and advising men to compete less decreases the gender gap in willingness to compete. We use three different forms of advice that emphasize the role of competitiveness, risk preferences and overconfidence respectively. We will investigate both the average effect across the three forms, and the effect of each form on its own. "
