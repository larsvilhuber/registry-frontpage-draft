abstract: "The RCT will be conducted with a leading travel company and tour operator in Germany. The firm sells its products online but also through a large number of mostly independently owned travel agencies. These travel agencies work together with several tour operators and the respective tour operators pay the agencies through commissions typically set once a year. Common commission payments are defined as percentages of sales.

In our study, the treated agencies receive priority access to a service hotline that they can consult in case of booking changes, inquiries, or 
customer complaints for specific target destinations. Our goal is to investigate whether higher service quality affects the selling behavior of the travel agents."
