abstract: "We examine how Swiss firms adjust their investment plans in response to changes in the Swiss National Bank's (SNB) policy rate. Using an online survey experiment with a vignette, we target firms from the KOF Investment Survey to analyze investment revisions across sectors. The study explores nonlinearities and asymmetries in firms’ responses, the role of financing sources, and substitution effects. It identifies key transmission channels—demand, financing costs, and exchange rates—and considers how investment realization certainty influences reactions."
