abstract: "Convincing citizens to comply with social distancing measures and other public health precautions is challenging, especially in countries characterized by widespread distrust of government. We conduct an experiment to test the relative efficacy of different types of messages encouraging citizens to take precautions to slow the spread of covid-19. Each message is designed to activate a different mechanism: deference to expert opinion; self-interest; fear of punishment for violating public health laws; and deference to religious authorities. Messages are delivered via text to rural Ugandans in 13 districts throughout the country."
