abstract: "Empathy is said to be the antidote to in-group bias. In this study we evaluate the causal effects of empathy training on elite civil servants in collaboration with the civil service administration and assess its impact on social preferences, bureaucratic performance, and thought leadership. Recent research suggests that emphasizing malleability of empathy as being key to behavioral change. In a factorial design, we also assess the impacts of emotional intelligence training, the impact of reading material whose content application is assessed via social emotional learning exercises. We also randomize econometrics book (mastering metrics) across the civil servants subject to their selection of the metrics book, where book on empathy serves as the other serves as a condition. 

Update 13 March 2023. We are now also looking to evaluate the impact of empathy training (Utilitarian vs Malleavility vs Joint vs Control) using data from performance audits of civil servants. There are 12 government departments on which they can choose to recommend a budgetary allocation. We will evaluate the impact of our training on these 12 policy decisions in year 1 and year 2 post-treatment.
