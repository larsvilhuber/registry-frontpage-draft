abstract: "We examine the impact of a socioemotional skills intervention on agribusiness owners in a government program in Nigeria. The skills intervention covers a large spectrum of both intra- and inter-personal skills including emotional regulation, self-efficacy, personal initiative, planning, empathy, relatedness and negotiation, among others. Using a randomized controlled trial we examine whether socioemotional skills matter for economic empowerment, whether the returns to inter-personal socioemotional skills are higher when offered in combination with foundational intra-personal socioemotional skills, and how the returns differ by the gender of the business owner. The intervention will be offered through classroom instruction and reinforced using WhatsApp video content to impart socioemotional tools to beneficiaries of the Government of Nigeria Women and Youth Empowerment Program (WYEP) within component II of the Agro-Processing, Productivity Enhancement and Livelihood Improvement Support (APPEALS) project that promotes entrepreneurship in the agribusiness sector and targets young men (aged between 18 and 40 years) and women (over age 18).
