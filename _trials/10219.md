abstract: "This study aims at understanding news consumption and news sharing on Twitter. Specifically the purpose is to:
* Estimate parameters of the utility function that can explain the decision to share news (true or false). In particular how do individuals trade off veracity of the news / ideological bias of the news and potential virality of this news?
* Compare different policies that have been proposed to fight the circulation of fake news, in particular (a) making veracity salient (b) asking for confirmation clicks (c) proposing fact checking.
* Evaluate the impact on beliefs and voting intentions of exposing individuals to balanced content.
Two experiments will be conducted during the campaign of the 2022 midterm elections."
