abstract: "According to the 2011 Demographic Health Survey, nearly half of all Cameroonian women had recently suffered emotional, physical and/or sexual Intimate Partners Violence (IPV). In this context, the Social Safety Nets project (Projet Filets Sociaux, PFS) which is supporting the establishment of a basic national safety net system, including a cash transfer program with accompanying measures for the poorest households, is piloting new initiatives to prevent IPV. 
The proposed evaluation will study the impacts of two innovative interventions, a couples training, and a radio edutainment intervention, integrated into the existing package of accompanying measures for PFS beneficiary households. These interventions are designed to reduce IPV by influencing behaviors and shifting perceptions of social norms around violence. The study will measure the impact of each of the interventions as well as measure which one is the more effective at preventing IPV, filling critical knowledge gaps on what works in the context of social safety nets projects. 
The study aims to answer the following questions: 
1.	What is the impact of adding couples’ training to a cash transfer program on IPV, cooperation within the household, and women’s economic empowerment? 
2.	What is the impact on these same outcomes of adding edutainment, in the form radionovela listening groups, to a cash transfer program?
3.	Is there a differential impact of either intervention in refugee host communities? 
4.	Is there a differential impact of either intervention on monogamous vs. polygamous households? "
