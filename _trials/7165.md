abstract: "Background & aims:  Clinical studies have reported positive results with omega-3 supplements in oncologic patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Omega-3 fatty acids supplementation in improving nutritional status and inflammatory markers of patients with lung cancer.
Methods: In a randomized double blind parallel design trial, sixty patients with lung cancer at nutritional status risk based on Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 were randomized to be allocated to two study groups, receiving omega 3 fatty acids supplement (EPA 1.6 g and DHA 0.8 g) or placebo for 12 weeks. Anthropometric measurements (weight, BMI, upper-arm circumference, and triceps skinfold thickness), nutritional based laboratory indices (hemoglobin, albumin, triglyceride, cholesterol), and inflammatory markers (CRP, TNF alpha, and IL-6) were measured before and after the intervention as study outcomes.
