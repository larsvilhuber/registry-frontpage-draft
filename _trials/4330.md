abstract: "We experimentally study whether individuals adopt negative beliefs about others’ intentions to justify egoistic behavior. In contrast with Di Tella, et al. (2015), our first study finds no evidence that individuals engage in “strategic cynicism.” We reconcile the discrepancy, using Di Tella, et al.’s, data, a simple model of belief manipulation and a novel experiment that replicates and extends Di Tella, et al. Across three datasets, we find no evidence of negatively biased beliefs. However, Di Tella, et al.’s, results and our data indicate that those with a greater incentive to view others’ intentions cynically exhibit relatively less positive beliefs."
