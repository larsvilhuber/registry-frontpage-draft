abstract: "Savings groups are part of a micro-savings movement quickly expanding across most of the developing world. Most often organized by NGOs, members of these groups save together, generating funds they then lend out to group members, generating interest on their savings. This study is a randomized evaluation of one prominent program, Saving for Change (SfC) by Oxfam America, Freedom from Hunger, and the Strømme Foundation (OA/FFH) in Mali. We find little evidence that these groups expand business activities, investments in agriculture, or increase expenditures at endline. However, households in treatment villages report improved food security and high frequency surveys demonstrate that consumption variability across seasons is reduced in villages offered SfC. We find no evidence of improvements in health, increased enrollment of children in school, or in women’s social capital, community involvement and intra-household decision-making power."
