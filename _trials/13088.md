abstract: "A large literature in economics, management and psychology has shown that performance is affected by goals set by employers and that the relationship between the specific goal size and performance is inversely U-shaped. In this study, we ask the question whether and to what extent the goals can effectively be targeted to individual people based on their prior performance and, importantly, their personal traits (preferences, personality traits and beliefs).
