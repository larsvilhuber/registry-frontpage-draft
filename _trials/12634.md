abstract: "The Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) is collaborating with Code for America (CfA) and a state partner to evaluate the effectiveness of a text message campaign encouraging use of a new online document uploader to submit required documents for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) applications. The campaign is designed to make it easier to submit verification documents, reduce procedural denials, and increase access to benefits for eligible applicants. These findings will help identify strategies to decrease SNAP procedural denial rates, which can be scaled across other US states and possibly other public benefits programs. Conditional on data availability, this project will also build evidence on equitable outcomes by answering to what extent the intervention increased access to SNAP resources among underserved groups."
