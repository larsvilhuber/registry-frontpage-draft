abstract: "Through a randomized controlled experiment, this study tests whether the Targeting Ultra-poor program (TUP) can have a sustainable impact on householdsâ€™ livelihoods in Afghanistan. The study focuses in the Balkh Province. A baseline survey of TUP-eligible households was conducted in 2016. After the administration of the baseline, village public lotteries were used to randomly assign 1,219 ultra-poor households into a treatment group that received the TUP support or a control group for comparison. Treatment households received a comprehensive package including productive assets, training, and consumption transfers, aiming to overcome multiple constraints simultaneously to lift ultra-poor households onto a path towards sustainable livelihoods. The intervention was conducted between May 2016 and July 2017, and two follow-up data collections are scheduled for 2018 and 2019."
