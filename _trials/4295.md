abstract: "Our goal is to study innovative ways to overcome the challenge of getting HIV-positive people into the treatment pipeline. Despite the availability of free, life-saving treatment, nearly one million people died of AIDS in 2017. This is largely driven by low HIV testing rates: a quarter of those living with HIV do not know their status (WHO 2017). In Africa this problem is worse for men, in part because pregnant women are routinely tested and treated for HIV. We will investigate whether a soft commitment device (a scheduled appointment) and a hard commitment device (a small money transfer conditional on HIV testing) can increase HIV testing among men in Zomba Town, Malawi."
