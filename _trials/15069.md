abstract: "We conduct a comprehensive examination of the quality of AI-led interviews using a combination. For this purpose, we conducted qualitative interviews with human subjects by delegating the task of interviewing to an AI. We show that the AI interviewer follows methodological guidelines and engages participants. AI-led interviews allow hypothesis generation, outperform standard open-ended survey questions by broadening the set of measurable phenomena, and predict economic behavior half a year later. We conduct additional surveys and experiments to complement these findings."
