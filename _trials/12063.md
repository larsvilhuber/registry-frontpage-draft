abstract: "Food waste is a major challenge for the short-term business profitability and the long-term environmental sustainability of food service providers, mainly in developing countries. This research is focused on food waste generated at kitchen stage by SMEs restaurants in the for-profit hospitality sector of Cusco (Peru). SMEs are at least 90% of food service providers in the study context. Restaurants generate approximately 14.6 tons of organic waste per day (99% is food waste), which constitutes 24% of the total food waste and 13% of the total solid waste generated in Cusco city. This research aims to enhance the existing literature by evaluating experimentally the effects of information transfer on small and micro-sized food service enterprises, with the ultimate objective of reducing food waste generation. In order to capture causal effects, a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) was employed. Small and micro-sized enterprises (SMEs) were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. The RCT will comprise a baseline, midline, and endline. The treatment intervention offers information and training to SMEs’ managers (owners) and chefs to incentivize the adoption of food management innovations and ultimately to reduce the generation of organic waste at kitchen stage. Based on Cost-benefit and Cost- effectiveness analyses, this study provides evidence-based policy instruments to improve the pro-environmental performance of firms."
