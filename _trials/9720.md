abstract: "The 1P Foundation is a California-based foundation created in 2020 that is taking a unique approach to homelessness in the Los Angeles community, utilizing micro-loans to help prevent individuals from falling into homelessness. Through the STEP Fund, 1P aims to prevent homelessness by providing non-punitive, no-interest micro-loans to economically vulnerable Los Angelenos who are at imminent risk of homelessness. The project team is evaluating the impact of the 1P micro-loan intervention on housing stability, employment, earnings, and financial stability through an RCT design. "
