abstract: "The purpose is to understand how smokers respond to cigarette taxes.  Specifically, we study how smokers reallocate their budgets when cigarettes become more expensive, a subject about which little is known. This is especially surprising because the literature has found little effect of cigarette taxes on smoking. That is, given a household budget constraint, when cigarette taxes increase, something must change if smokers are to continue smoking at the same intensity. In addition to an analysis of consumer expenditure survey (CEX) data, we plan to conduct a randomized survey experiment via the survey research platform Prolific. The survey will be of 1,200 current smokers. We plan to ask baseline questions on smoking intensity and shopping behavior, as well as consumption of non-combustible tobacco products. We also ask about baseline weekly expenditures on cigarettes and other discretionary items. We then ask respondents to forecast their smoking and discretionary spending over the next 12 months. Some respondents are randomly assigned a hypothetical cigarette tax increase that randomly varies between 10% and 100%. The questions are framed relative to each respondents revealed weekly cigarette expenditures. We have two goals. First, we seek evidence that smokers do adjust on some dimension when taxes increase. Our survey captures potential changes in expenditures in a wide variety of discretionary categories, as well as labor supply. Second, we use the randomized survey experiment to better understand the dimensions on which smokers adjust consumption when taxes increase. This informs our analysis of CEX data. In addition to closed-ended questions on potential responses to cigarette taxes, we also ask an open-ended question on potential responses. We will use AI to categorized these responses and evaluate how they differ by treatment arm."
