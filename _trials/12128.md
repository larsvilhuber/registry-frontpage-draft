abstract: "The issue of sexual harassment in the workplace has been gaining importance in the public debate, especially in recent years and since the #MeToo movement in 2017. Studies have shown that women are willing to give up a significant portion of their salaries to avoid harassment, leading to occupational segregation and macro-level negative consequences. The availability of data and successful experiments have allowed researchers to establish a consensus on the detrimental effects of sexual harassment, primarily focusing on the dynamics between the victim and perpetrator, as well as its broader implications within organizations and society. However, there is a scarcity of evidence regarding the impact of those in the surrounding environment (for instance colleagues), despite anecdotal evidence highlighting an important role in preventing harassment, helping the victim and providing testimony in legal cases. Bystanders have the potential to influence both victims and perpetrators, but they can remain silent, fostering long-term toxic environment where victim will not report, and harassers continue to abuse individuals. In this study, we study the belief of bystanders about sexual harassment, and how these beliefs determine bystanders' choices to provide assistance. "
