abstract: "This randomized controlled trial examines the impact of financial incentives on promoting physical activity and emphasizes the significance of goal definition within this context. Previous studies have consistently demonstrated the positive effects of financial incentives in enhancing physical activity. However, it is not only the magnitude of the financial reward that influences behavior change, but also the clarity and specificity of the goal itself. Goal Setting Theory posits that clearly defined goals are crucial for achieving optimal outcomes. Surprisingly, existing literature primarily compares a control group which is given the same goal as the treatment groups with a precisely defined goal, often overlooking an intermediate "Give your best" group. Furthermore, most studies only focus on one goal level. There are different assumptions regarding high goal levels. Some researchers posit that higher goals lead to higher outcomes because of the motivational effects, whereas others argue that high goals lead to not trying at all. Consequently, it becomes crucial to compare different goal levels in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of their impact. By addressing this research gap, we aim to enhance the understanding of how goal definition, in conjunction with financial incentives, can effectively promote physical activity engagement and contribute to the development of more effective intervention strategies.

We have developed a between-subject randomized controlled trial to test the effects of low and high goals on goal achievement, defined as steps per day. Approximately 500 participants between the ages of 18 and 85 will be randomly assigned to one of two experimental treatments or the control treatment. Participants will receive information about the intervention one day before the experiment starts. The intervention lasts one day, so that participants can give their all on that specific day. 

We run the experiment within an ongoing 365-day long study with subjects who are all seeking to improve their physical activity. All participants have been positively health screened, are using a smartphone app (ActiVAtE Behavior) to transmit their steps (main performance measure) in a timely manner and have already provided extensive individual data at the time of the intervention.
