abstract: "In this trial, I investigate the impact of intrahousehold belief disagreement on household portfolio choice. Going beyond what would be possible in a typical observational study, the experimental methodology allows causal identification of any effects of disagreement between spouses over future stock market returns. Furthermore, I investigate the role of information in the intrahousehold financial decision-making process."
