abstract: "China’s global reputation and soft power have been overestimated by the Chinese public (Huang 2021). What leads to the inflated national image? How the use of propaganda shapes the Chinese public’s national image? Huang (2021) posits that Chinese propaganda, with its omnipresent praise of the country and censorship of negative news, explains the escalating national narcissism. In recent years, the Chinese government has shifted part of the propaganda from traditional media to social media, as it is more widespread and targets a larger audience. Using an online survey experiment, I examine the effectiveness of positive foreign views in increasing the credibility of Chinese propaganda and whether such exposure results in the overconfident Chinese public regarding their world reputation.
