abstract: "Our research question is whether a mobile application that teaches students from disadvantaged backgrounds how to buffer themselves against the stressors of university life through their social group identities can improve students’ completion of tertiary studies and academic performance. A secondary question is whether the app improves re enrolment rates in the subsequent semester."
