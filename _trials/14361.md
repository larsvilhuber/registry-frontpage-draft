abstract: "We analyze the effect of digital nudges on forest owners' choice of adopting two forestry practices with climate change mitigation potential: ash fertilization and tending of young stands/seedlings. The experiment is conducted in a government-run internet portal designed particularly for Finnish non-industrial private forest owners. Our hypothesis posits that digital nudges exert a small and positive influence on the adoption of these potentially climate-friendly practices. The effects of the digital nudges are measured using forest owners' contact requests, subsidy applications as well as forest owner and forest estate specific data. "
