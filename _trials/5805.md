abstract: "The humanitarian crisis in Venezuela has spurred large out-migration to neighbouring countries since 2015. In Peru, the estimated number of Venezuelan citizens within the territory exceeds 900,000 people, equivalent to around 3 percent of the total population. The Peruvian government has taken several measures to mitigate the negative impact of the lockdown on the most vulnerable, such as direct cash transfers and the distribution of food baskets, but none include the Venezuelan migrant population. Living in extreme situations of vulnerability, the COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders pose a serious threat to their livelihoods.

We will conduct a small-scale randomized evaluation (RCT), testing the effect of a direct cash transfer to a group of Venezuelan migrants residing in Peru during lockdown. The transfer will be proportional to that distributed by the national government to the Peruvian population during quarantine. We will later conduct high frequency surveys to understand the impact of the transfer on migrant consumption, well-being, intra-household dynamics, and adherence to social-distancing measures. This will allow us to understand the effect of including migrant population into national public policies during the COVID-19 pandemic.  

Our study will use a sample of 143 migrant households living in Peru during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample already participates in an ongoing tracking study and was initially recruited and surveyed in August 2019 at Peruâ€™s northern border with Ecuador. A second in-person tracking survey was conducted in February/March 2020. A third COVID-19 phone interview was administered April 2020. Following the third wave, we plan on providing a direct cash transfer to a randomly selected treatment group. Three subsequent waves phone surveys are planned following the cash transfer intervention. Outcome variables will include: a) well-being, b) consumption, c) intra-household dynamics, and d) compliance with government imposed social-distancing measures.

We expect to find that, on average, the individuals that receive the treatment will increase their consumption and food intake, demonstrate increased well-being, enjoy better intra-household dynamics, and comply more strictly with the social-distancing measures. We are also interested in exploring heterogeneous treatment effects across different types of individuals, namely beneficiaries with regular vs. irregular migratory status. 

For analysis, we intend to use parametric statistics (ANCOVA) and test for robustness using non-parametric statistics (randomization inference).
