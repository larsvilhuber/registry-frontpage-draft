abstract: "We use a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in rural Morocco to test whether matching loan repayments closely with expected entrepreneurial cash flows increases the take-up and poverty impact of microcredit. We introduce two new forms of individual-liability microcredit: a contract with a five-month grace period and, second, a ‘tailored’ contract where the repayment schedule is split into three equal periods (with varying installments). We first randomize an estimated 3,600 participants (all interested in and eligible for a standard loan) into either of the two new loan contracts or a control loan with the standard contract. We measure the effect on individuals’ repayment behavior, entrepreneurial activities and household consumption. We then use information campaigns to randomize the available information about the different treatments (the two new loan types and the standard loan) across 320 villages. We measure the impact on loan take-up and repayment quality at the village level."
