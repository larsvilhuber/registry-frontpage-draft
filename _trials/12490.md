abstract: "This lab experiment investigates how potential cooperation between firms on sustainable consumption and production (SCP) investments affects subsequent price competition. In an initial stage, duopolists make a binary sustainability investment decision (e.g., corresponding to waste and pollution reduction, energy efficiency technology adoption, etc.) that affects their costs. Investment also shifts demand, as some consumers value sustainability. In later stages firms set prices simultaneously in a sequence of indefinitely repeated rounds. To investigate how cooperation in SCP investment affects price competition, in some treatments the sellers can communicate in the investment stage. The experiment implements communication using free-form chat or more restrictive messages focused on the investment decision in different treatments. It also includes exogenous random variation in investment success. Treatments also vary costs and demand so that either investment or non-investment is a profit-maximizing strategy conditional on noncooperative pricing. The experiment also elicits subjectsâ€™ risk tolerance and social value orientation."
