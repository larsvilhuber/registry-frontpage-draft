abstract: "There are many reasons why individuals ignore advice. Many of these reasons will relate to the quality of the advice, but even after accounting for uncertainty about advice it may be that some continue to fail to accept advice even when it is clear the advice benefits them. Our study focuses on exactly that setting. In a controlled environment we ensure (a) that adopting advice improves the expected pecuniary payoff and (b) that this is clear to potential advisees. In this way we can be confident that anyone ignoring advice knowingly damages their pecuniary payoff. We also wish to understand whether and how the domain of the advice matters (we look at luck vs effort) and whether the characteristics of the advisee matters (we consider a number of behavioral factors and demographics). This experiment is part of a longer-running project that seeks to explore when individuals opt to continue with behavior that is likely to damage their utility."
