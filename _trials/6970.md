abstract: "I design field and lab-in-the field experiments at a test preparation institute in Colombia to understand how students incorporate relative performance feedback into their beliefs and decisions. I focus on a high-stakes context where relative performance beliefs are particularly consequential - college entrance exams - and aim to answer the following question: How do beliefs about academic ability and academic choices change when students of different ability levels learn about their performance relative to their peers? I conduct an RCT in which I randomly assign students taking the course either to receive or not to receive feedback about their quartile in the score distribution in weekly practice tests. I elicit beliefs about their perceived quartiles after each practice test and provide the treatment group with an above-/below- median signal to study belief updating. Combining elicited beliefs and administrative data from the course and university admissions, I study (i) belief updating, (ii) academic investments, (iii) performance, and (iv) academic decisions."
