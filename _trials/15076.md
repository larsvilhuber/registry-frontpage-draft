abstract: "The aim of this research is to clarify the impact of “breastfeeding myths” in Japan on the behavior and attitudes of mothers. As breastfeeding myths such as “breast milk is the proof of love” and “powdered formula is a way of cutting corners” spread, mothers are under excessive pressure, which leads to mental stress. We will investigate the impact of these social expectations on the child-rearing behavior and mental health of mothers, and clarify the extent to which breastfeeding myths as social norms are misconceived. Furthermore, we will examine how correcting breastfeeding myths by providing correct information will affect mothers' attitudes of breastfeeding, and aim to make policy recommendations to promote a healthy childcare environment.
