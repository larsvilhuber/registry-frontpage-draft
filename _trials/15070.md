abstract: "We conduct a follow-up survey to a study that is published as a working paper and that was also pre-registered. The initial working paper version and pre-registration are available as CESifo Working Paper No. 10329 (https://www.cesifo.org/en/publications/2023/working-paper/politicians-social-welfare-criteria-experiment-german-legislators-0) and AEARCTR-0007689 (https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/7689). The Abstract of the initial working paper describes the content of this follow up study and reads as follows: 

Much economic analysis derives policy recommendations based on social welfare criteria intended to model the preferences of a policy maker. Yet, little is known about policy maker’s normative views in a way amenable to this use. In a behavioral experiment, we elicit German legislators’ social welfare criteria unconfounded by political economy constraints. When resolving preference conflicts across individuals, politicians place substantially more importance on least-favored than on most-favored alternatives, contrasting with both common aggregation mechanisms and the equal weighting inherent in utilitarianism and the Kaldor-Hicks criterion. When resolving preference conflicts within individuals, we find no support for the commonly used “long-run criterion” which insists that choices merit intervention only if the lure of immediacy may bias intertemporal choice. Politicians’ and the public’s social welfare criteria largely coincide."
