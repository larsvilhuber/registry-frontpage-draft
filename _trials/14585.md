abstract: "Despite the potential of digital innovations in agricultural extension to increase the uptake of best management practices in rice-based farming systems in Nigeria, a large-scale use of digital extension is not observed due to the lack of supplementary gender-differentiated in-person extension services and the absence of a gender-transformative approach in technology diffusion processes. The study aims to address the barriers inhibiting women’s adoption of innovations, digital technologies, and access to agricultural advice. The main research question is: Does bundling “women’s empowerment training, digital extension, and in-person extension” increase the adoption of improved cultural practices and use of mechanization in rice-based farming systems in Nigeria?"
