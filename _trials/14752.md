abstract: "Government propaganda plays a crucial role in communicating political agenda and policy goals in China. Understanding how it works can shed light on how propaganda shapes public support. We experimentally study the effect of green policy propaganda in regional China, randomizing the order of exposure to environmental protection messages in over 200 villages. Specifically, we are interested in 1. How does green policy propaganda affect public support and perception for government spending on environmental issues? 2. Does propaganda affect individual higher order beliefs about the policy? 3. How does potential public exposure of survey results affect individual responses? Answers to these questions help us understand how propaganda can help motivate support for green policies as well as how effective are government propaganda in mobilizing support."
