abstract: "Potentially harmful misinformation runs rampant on social media across a wide set of countries. We explore how fact-checking podcasts can be used to inhibit citizens’ exposure to misinformation, increase their knowledge about COVID-19, and ultimately increase their compliance with public health policies. The intervention we study uses WhatsApp-delivered podcasts as an attention-catching method of delivering verified information to individuals who may otherwise have limited access to credible online sources. We partner with the first and largest fact-checking organization in sub-Saharan Africa, Africa Check, and randomize the delivery of variants of their programming to a recruited sample of participants in a panel survey in South Africa. The study has implications both for understanding how citizens’ exposure to misinformation can be reduced with low- cost interventions and how the correction of false information can increase citizens’ trust in public policies."
