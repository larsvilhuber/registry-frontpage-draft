abstract: "In this study, we implement a field experiment in which we test the effect of a digital platform on children’s interest in STEM-related fields. Stereotypical beliefs of STEM occupations may not correspond well with the reality of those jobs. Children may believe that men are more skilled in STEM compared to women. Besides, children may have wrong preconceptions such as STEM professionals work on their own rather than in teams and do not work on societal relevant topics. By counteracting false beliefs about STEM jobs, we want to enable boys and girls to develop an interest in STEM. To do so, we have developed a platform that aims at reducing stereotypical thinking about STEM occupations by presenting different STEM jobs and their applications and presents potential female and male role-models working in STEM. In addition, it incorporates mini games that are related to STEM fields focusing on active learning by using gamification tools such as instant feedback and goal rewards in the form of badges (“science badge,” “math badge”, …). Our intervention focuses on the children themselves (and not on parents or teachers) since children’s preferences may be more malleable at a young age than adults’ preferences. However, we test the impact of a parents’ brochure. In the brochure, we want to raise parents’ awareness about the effects of stereotypical thinking on children’s’ interests as well as on their math capacity. We give advice on how to increase children’s interest in math and STEM in general.
