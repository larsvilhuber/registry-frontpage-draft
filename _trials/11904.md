abstract: "The Wilson Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunities (LEO) has partnered with Thread of Baltimore, Maryland to evaluate their high school mentorship program, an intensive mentoring program for inner-city youth who are at the highest risk for dropping out of high school. Students are identified for the program if they have GPAs in the bottom quartile after their first semester of 9th grade. Historically, the four-year graduation rate for these students is just 5%. Eligible students are connected to volunteers who help establish goals and identify and remove significant barriers. A key component of the intervention is a model of long-term relationship building across lines of difference, with a goal to construct a permanent social network to youth who are otherwise socioeconomically isolated. To evaluate this program, we will use a randomized control trial (RCT) to examine whether the program improves graduation rates and other educational and early-life outcomes, including academic performance, high school completion, college-going, criminal justice contact, and mortality. Eligible students are randomly assigned to either Thread or a control group, with approximately 630 in each group. The study will utilize administrative records from Baltimore City Public Schools, the Maryland Longitudinal Data System, and the National Student Clearinghouse, as well as program data. Results from this RCT will be disseminated to policymakers and providers across the country to inform the replication and expansion of programs designed to support underperforming high school students. We plan to enroll 1260 people in the study over three years (academic years 2022-23 to 2024-25), of which approximately 630 will be offered a spot in Thread. We conservatively assume that 60% of those offered (378 individuals) will enroll in the program. Assuming a baseline high school graduation rate of 10% (likely higher than the actual control group completion rate), we are powered to detect a 5.2 percentage point increase in graduation rates which is about one eighth of the observational differences Thread has documented."
