abstract: "In Spain, the reform of the Violence Against Women (VAW) law (Royal Decree-Law 9/2018) made it possible to report gender violence without going to the police or court. The advantage of this kind of “soft reporting” is that victims or witnesses can report to social services and thereby gain access to legal, economic and psychological support without having to identify or denounce the aggressor. It is expected that the availability of soft reporting will help to reduce costs and overcome barriers to reporting.

Results of a previous experiment (AEARCTR-0010397) showed that potential witnesses are more willing to intervene using the soft reporting option compared with the hard reporting option. In this study, we want to disentangle the main mechanisms that make people more inclined to intervene via soft reporting than via hard reporting. Specifically, our experiment is designed to isolate the relevance of three elements associated with the soft-reporting option: the fact that witnesses do not have to identify and denounce the aggressor, the fact that they do not have to identify themselves, and the fact that they do not have to go to the police.
