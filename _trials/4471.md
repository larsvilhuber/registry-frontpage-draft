abstract: "This study examines whether higher quality teachers prefer and select into schools which offer performance incentives. Using a randomized control trial, which varied whether teacher raises were based on i). objective performance (their students' percentile value-added), ii). subjective performance (as rated by their principal) or iii). a flat raise, unrelated to performance, we investigate the composition of teachers which end up teaching at each type of school a year after the introduction of the contracts. Additional variation in the type of contract offered, principal information and teachers' information about their midterm performance allows us to disentangle the role of risk-preferences versus private information in their sorting decision. Using this data, we then model a two-sided choice problem of teacher employment to predict what would happen if all schools moved to performance contracts and the extent of adverse selection that is corrected through these contracts.
