abstract: "The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in China has reached a concerning level of 10.8%, presenting a significant public health challenge. Beyond its progression to end-stage renal disease, CKD substantially elevates the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and malignant neoplasms, consequently imposing a considerable burden on healthcare resources. Empirical evidence suggests that early detection and intervention in CKD management can efficaciously mitigate disease progression. However, the awareness of CKD in China remains strikingly low at 10.0%, particularly low among individuals with early-stage CKD. This underscores the imperative need for comprehensive public health education initiatives and early screening programs focused on kidney disease.

Preliminary investigations have demonstrated that conventional methodologies, such as poster campaigns and continuing education programs for community healthcare providers, have yielded limited efficacy. The present study is situated within the context of CKD health education and screening for individuals, employing an innovative online survey experiment that incorporates diverse informational components. This research endeavors to elucidate the impact of various health education strategies on individuals' participation rates, specifically examining registrations and test kit acquisitions. The study utilizes a multifaceted approach, exploring the effects of different types of information dissemination, including health hazard awareness, time cost considerations, conformity information, and information avoidance behaviors. Furthermore, it investigates the differential effects of these health education strategies on high-risk CKD populations, with a particular focus on their engagement in CKD screening and long-term monitoring protocols."
