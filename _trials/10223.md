abstract: "People have preferences over complexity, as shown in previous studies of complexity preferences over gambles. However, complexity preferences over information methods – ways of receiving information about the state of the world – have not been studied. This is despite the ubiquity of situations where people have a choice between information methods. In this experiment, preferences over complexity of information methods are measured by participants making choices between pairs of information methods that differ in informativeness and/or complexity. After choosing an information method, they then use it in a ball-and-urn belief updating task to estimate the probability that a particular urn was chosen. Differences in choices between pairs of information methods allow observation of complexity preferences."
