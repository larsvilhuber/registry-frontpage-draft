abstract: "We develop a novel survey instrument, based on a survey of 1,831 public officials across 382 organizations, to construct measures of the individual-level information that bureaucrats have about their local conditions and operating environment.  Specifically, we elicit the beliefs of bureaucrats across a range of key indicators upon which their work depends (demographic, socio-economic, and sector-specific indicators)  and benchmark these beliefs against objective measures to calculate the scale of error for each bureaucrat.   We tie descriptive evidence to the theoretical literature on information acquisition and document how information is associated with individual and organizational characteristics, focusing on measures of hierarchy.  

We run an experiment to provide a random subsample of offices in the bureaucracy evidence briefings prior to eliciting their individual-level information to study how evidence briefings can alter the beliefs of policymakers.  Such briefings have long been used within public service and are increasingly a focus of research entities such as the Centre for Economic Policy Research, JPAL/IPA, and the World Bank Group, yet there is surprisingly little evidence on whether such briefings do in fact inform public officials.  We provide an information package that exactly mimics circulars (internal communications) of the Ethiopian government to a random subset of the officials that we study. The information package contains all the information we test for in our survey. Lowering the marginal cost of information acquisition dramatically and symmetrically in this way should yield superior information overall (Aghion and Tirole, 1997). 

The errors made by treated officials are 0.28 of a standard deviation lower than control officials, consistent with evidence from a range of settings that reducing the cost of becoming informed increases information acquisition.  However, the treatment effect arises totally from organizations with below-average management practices, reinforcing our descriptive findings that organizational incentives are key mediating factors in how new information is received and absorbed. This result is of significance to researchers who aim to update the beliefs of public officials. 

Our experimental findings highlight that when the public sector is designed appropriately, the rationale for compensating interventions - which are often ad hoc and focused on short term goals - is weakened."
