abstract: "Aflatoxin is a serious public health threat in many low-income countries. In Senegal, where groundnuts are a primary crop for both home consumption and export, the problem is particularly critical: strict phytosanitary standards in the EU have closed Senegalâ€™s biggest historical market. We study the roll-out of a new technology to control aflatoxin. In partnership with two farming cooperatives, we implement a randomized trial to test a contracting arrangement for use of the new technology and production of low-aflatoxin groundnuts. "
