abstract: "The aim of this paper is to study the linkages between self and social image. Our framework introduces two new elements. First, players can either (i) strategically choose the criterion based on which they will judge their own actions or (ii) decide to ignore all moral dimensions and pay for blindness. Second, and most importantly, we link self-image to social-image by imposing a coherence principle between the way self-image is calculated and the way other people’s actions are judged: individuals use the same criterion to judge themselves and others. The benefit of this coherence motive can be microfounded by the cost documented in the literature in social psychology of being perceived as a hypocrite, as well as the willingness of people to avoid cognitive dissonance induced by behaving inconsistently. We test the predictions of our model in the context of a dictator game experiment with passive observers. The main treatment is a game in which observers are themselves active and need to take the action they judge before sending their evaluation of the behaviour of the dictators. The change in observers’ evaluations allows to test the coherence principle, while the change in dictator’s behavior provides empirical evidence on whether such a change in social image is internalized."
