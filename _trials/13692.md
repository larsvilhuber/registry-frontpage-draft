abstract: "We are studying the three main obstacles to the recruitment of senior workers, identified by the literature: distance to retirement, too specialized human capital and outdated initial training. In order to gain an understanding of the importance of each of these obstacles, we are conducting a correspondence study, sending fictitious CVs to firms of workers over 55 years old. We plan to also conduct a more qualitative study using input from Human Resources (HR) recruiters to understand the belief systems that lead to lower callback rates for senior workers."
