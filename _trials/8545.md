abstract: "The project will test the hypothesis that birth registration of unmarried adolescent girls, coupled with a phone-based system for reporting of potential child marriage cases, can lower the incidence of female early marriage in rural Bangladesh. 

To test this hypothesis, the project will introduce a randomized controlled trial in 240 communities in northern Bangladesh with the following treatment arms: (i) 60 communities where the project offers, to households with unmarried adolescent girls, covering the cost of birth registration at local government digital centres; (ii) 60 communities where the project provides households with information on the Bangladesh governmentâ€™s national helpline for reporting potential child marriage cases; (iii) 60 communities where the project offers to cover the cost of birth registration and provides information on the national helpline; (iv) 60 communities that serve as a control group. 

The project will evaluate the effects of the intervention on the incidence of female early marriage (marriage below the age of 18), as well as school enrolment among adolescent girls, will be assessed via an endline survey conducted 9 months after the intervention has been completed."
