abstract: "In this study, we explore an under-studied form of discrimination which bases on worker’s visible gender expression and presentation. Gender expression refers to the ways in which workers present or perform their gender identity to their family, relatives, friends, coworkers, and the external social world. Clients' perception of how workers express their gender might interact with occupation-specific gender norms to generate disparity in hiring, retention, and career advancement. This can be especially prevalent in care industries because care is symbolically associated with womanhood and femininity, and care provision is considered “women’s jobs”.  In addition, given the prevailing racialized sexual stereotypes in the US, clients' perception of workers' gender expression might also amplify or mediate the effect of racial factors in hiring. 

To test for gender expression discrimination, we utilize experimental methods, combining online survey and stimulated decision making.  Overall, the study seeks to expand the literature and deepen our understanding of gender-based discrimination, and identity-based discrimination in general. Our experiment highlights the ways in which races, gender, and sexuality overlap and manifest as potential employment barriers, especially for workers in entry-level, lower-paying occupations."
