abstract: "Do investments in equipment upgrades at Vocational and Technical Education Training (TVET) schools increase the wages and employability of poor Mongolians? This study will evaluate  the incremental impact of school equipment upgrades on both academic and labor-market outcomes. We hypothesize that being assigned to study with upgraded equipment will cause students to be more likely to train with improved equipment. We hypothesize that exposure to more current equipment will improve their factual understanding of the trade and familiarize the students with the tools actually used by employers. Employers should then find students more productive than they otherwise would, making it more likely that students will be able to find employment and increasing the wages that employers are willing to pay them. To identify these effects, we worked with a select set of TVET schools in Mongolia to conduct admissions lotteries in three admission years, 2010, 2011, and 2012. Baseline data was collected at time of admission application and follow-up data will be analyzed to assess the impact of TVET training with improved equipment on labor market outcomes."
