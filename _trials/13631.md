abstract: "The project "Closing Gaps (CG)" is a unique longitudinal randomized control trial that randomly assigned children in Ecuador to their elementary classrooms for seven consecutive years, with a 98.9% compliance rate of the randomization. This project is in its 13th year. The project has collected data for approximately 28,000 students on math and language achievement, executive function, behavioral issues, socio-demographics, and non-cognitive variables, among others, accompanied by information on teachers, principals, and parents.  In the most recent data collection waves, we gathered information on use of time, income, labor market, training, family and household care activities, risk behaviors, exposure to crime and gangs, and perception of security in neighborhoods, among others.
