abstract: "Inducing respondents to truthfully reveal their preferences in stated preference valuation requires that they believe their survey responses can translate into real-life consequences, i.e. they believe their responses are consequential. The existing approaches for measuring respondents’ perceptions of the consequentiality of the survey are not incentivized and, thus, may lead to dishonest or careless answers to the belief elicitation questions. We address this issue by incentivizing the measurement of consequentiality perceptions in a discrete choice experiment concerning preferences towards private retirement policies to induce respondents to answer the perception elicitation questions honestly and carefully. The incentivization mechanism relies on the approach of choice-matching proposed by Cvitanić et al. (2019, AER: Insights, 1(2), 179-192). We use the incentivized perceptions over consequentiality to examine a recent finding in stated preference literature that the perceptions may depend on the degree of individuals’ trust in institutions that are responsible for implementing the policies in question. We assess whether trust in institutions affects consequentiality beliefs by using two priming treatments, one meant to temporarily increase individual trustfulness compared to a control condition and the other meant to temporarily decrease individual trustfulness compared to a control condition."
