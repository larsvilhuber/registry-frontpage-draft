abstract: "A new health center --- Brother Andre Maternal and Child Health Care Center --- recently opened in
Dandora, Kenya, a slum of approximately 150,000 inhabitants in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya.
Dandora is home to the city's largest garbage dump, and many struggle to find and keep consistent
employment.
The first goal of the project is to evaluate the impact of the health care center on the population. In
particular, we propose using randomization in the value and price of vouchers to experimentally vary
expectant mothers' propensity to use the health center, and then use this variation to measure the
impact of the hospital itself. Our hypothesis is that the hospital has significant effects on maternal
well-being after the birth, as measure in severity of hemorrhaging and child well-being as measured
by birth-weight.
The second goal of the project is to measure the effect of additional wealth on maternal and child
health outcomes. This is achieved through the randomization, since we will directly observe
households' characteristics and willingness-to-pay directly, but they will report their willingness-topay
before learning the price. This allows us to compare households who end up paying a lower
price to those who pay a higher one, and thereby learn the effect of additional wealth on average.
This provides important evidence for policies like maternal leave or even maternal grants that
financially support pregnancies. Our hypothesis is that the larger the difference is between a
household's stated willingness-to-pay and the the price the end up paying, the healthier the mother
and child will be.
The third goal of the project is to evaluate existing methodologies for understanding insurance
choice. Existing studies interpret data from markets in developed countries through a complicated
framework of statistical and economic assumptions to rationalize observed decisions and outcomes.
Our experimental study will, instead, measure many of these variables directly. This allows us to
apply existing methodologies to our experimental data and determine whether the answers are
correct or not. Our hypothesis is that a number of restrictive assumptions (multivariate logit errors,
ignoring adverse selection, neglecting the subjective beliefs of market participants) are important,
and lead to misleading results. We hope to either verify that these assumptions are problematic and
suggest remedies, or verify that existing approaches actually provide the right answers.

In particular, we want to measure the impact of the introduction of a new, safe, clean hospital to a
population who has previously reported experiencing obstetric violence at the hands of care-givers
and other serious challenges before, during, and after birth. Since we are exploiting experimental
variation to measure this effect, the results will tell us the benefits of introducing similar facilities into
comparable contexts. In many countries, traditional birth attendants and relatively inferior maternal
health clinics are still a challenge to maternal health, and the study will provide evidence about how
improved facilities can lead to better outcomes for mothers and children.
This experimental evidence will be achieved by randomizing the value and prices of vouchers for
care, and offering them to study participants (described in more detail below). This provides
economic data on how people in developing countries cope with the risk of incurring large
expenditures, particularly during a Cesarean section birth. We can then use these very rich data to
evaluate the methodology used by economists and public health specialists when trying to
understand insurance choice in developed countries, and provide a critique and possible remedies.
Since we are adopting a methodology
that allows us to observe household willingness-to-pay for insurance directly, we can provide
evidence on a well-defined and clear health risk (pregnancy), as opposed to a number of previous
studies that focus on crop insurance or general health insurance. The advantage of our study is that
it is health-related and a ubiquitous risk about which women face sincere risk. Unlike crop
insurance, it is a product many are familiar with (Kenya offers national health insurance, which is
unaffordable but desired by many in our targeted population). Unlike insurance experiments in the
US or Taiwan, our targeted population suffers a lack of institutions and outside options available to
those in developed countries. Finally, many households in developing countries hold their wealth in
relationships with other households, who share financial burdens and call in financial favors when
necessary. This makes the experimental evidence more useful for development policy compared to
studies from western countries, where financial assets or credit can be used to pay for care."
