abstract: "This study evaluates potential scale-up of a teacher performance pay system in Rwanda.  Working under the mandate of a Ministry of Education task force on the incorporation of learning outcomes in teachers' "imihigo" contracts, the study A/B tests design alternatives and evaluates impacts relative to control.  The contract design draws on evidence from the Supporting Teacher Achievement in Rwandan Schools (STARS) trial (Leaver et al., 2021), while working with the Sector Education Inspectorate to collect incentivized teacher input measures and while adapting the national Comprehensive Assessment as the basis for teacher learning metrics.  Over the course of three years, the study will undertake an adaptive design, winnowing an initial set of five designs down to a single, leading design, while generating evidence about efficacy relative to status-quo contracts.
