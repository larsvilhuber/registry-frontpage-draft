abstract: "Objective: We aimed to examine whether treatment as usual or treatment with ACT was more effective for stigma and shame among substance use disorders (SUD’s).
Method: A double blind, parallel assignment was conducted with 60 adults aged 18–35 years with SUD’s had sought care at one of four clinical centers in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, Pakistan. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive treatment with ACT or treatment as usual. All participants received ACT, delivered by therapists in 6-hour sessions and attended interviews at baseline. Primary outcomes stigma (enacted, anticipated, internalized)and shame, whereas secondary outcomes such as general health, quality of life, Acceptance and action questionnaire, multidimensional social support all were assessed at pre, post and follow up period with the help of research assistants.
Result: A two-way factorial ANOVA between subjects were performed, scores showed a significant difference between two groups at primary outcomes which are enacted stigma (F=30.44, p=.000, ηp2 = .244), anticipated stigma (F=17.56, P=.000, ηp2 =.157), internalized stigma (F=20.14, P=.000, ηp2 =.176) and shame (F=31.04, P=.000, ηp2 =.247) which all are significant at timeline model.
Conclusion: Results suggest that combined treatment with ACT was more effective for stigma and shame than treatment as usual for SUD’s. This study could serve as a model for designing future RCTs with ACT-related interventions.
Key words: ACT, Treatment as usual, SUD’s.
