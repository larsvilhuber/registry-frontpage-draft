abstract: "In this study, we estimate the effectiveness of the COVID-19 assistance package depending on the altruistic or business-motive framing
of the assistance package. The package consists of credit relief, direct cash transfers, and business training. We establish the causal impact of framing on the success of the package and each component of the package separately via a combination of randomization and natural-experimentation via discontinuities in the formulas determining the size of the financial assistance.
