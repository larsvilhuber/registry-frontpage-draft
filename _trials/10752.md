abstract: "We investigate the question to what extent incentives have an impact on the quality of answers to open-ended survey questions. To this end, we conduct an online survey study on Prolific asking participants open-ended questions as well as using items from established scales. Moreover, we investigate whether giving participants an additional incentive to provide high-quality answers, i.e., informing them that we will hire some of the participants again for a well-paid task depending on the quality of their answers, can increase the answer quality for open-ended questions. To do so, we randomly provide half of the participants with this additional incentive."
