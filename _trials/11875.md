abstract: "This project investigates whether providing additional categorical information generates negative or positive utility for consumers or people in general.  The authors plan to survey the data and content of a few existing studies to understand this research question. Specially, we compare the behavior when the different labels are provided versus when no label is provided.  

The (dis)utility people perceive when additional information is provided is of interest to policymakers, product managers, grocery stores, and the scientific community. For example, if people would rather not know whether a product is locally produced or not, this provides strong policy implications. This study precisely investigates the labeling disutility in various environments.
