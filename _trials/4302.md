abstract: "In contrast to the traditional model of a firm, a startup is fundamentally inseparable from its founder. This experiment aims to demonstrate that the strategic decisions of startups are determined by a tradeoff between the conflicting professional and personal motivations of their founders. We use priming to explore how the relative importance of entrepreneurial identity affects the behavior of founders who face a strategic choice that will increase startup growth at a personal cost.
