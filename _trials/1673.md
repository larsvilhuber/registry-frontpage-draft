abstract: "Can prize-linked incentives improve financial behavior?  We are working with a large not-for-profit credit counseling agency to examine whether lottery linked incentives can improve debt repayment behavior.  Randomly selected participants in the credit counseling agency's debt management plan (DMP) are receiving access to a program that links on-time debt repayment behavior with a small chance of debt forgiveness.  We plan to evaluate the impacts of prize-linked incentives on DMP retention, debt reduction, defaults, delinquencies and programmatic financial self-sustainability.  "
