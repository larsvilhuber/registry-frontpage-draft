abstract: "Throughout the world, a large number of children are growing up or have grown up in families with alcohol and/or drug problems with far reaching consequences on children's current and future life, including anxiety, depression, self-destructive behaviors (e.g. attempted suicide or drug addiction), etc. In Denmark, a country of 5.8 million inhabitants, the extent of the problem is such that 632,000 individuals are growing up or have grown up in families with alcohol problems. 

Despite the large prevalence of the problem and its dramatic consequences, there is still little robust evidence showing the causal impact of programs designed to help individuals growing up or who have grown up in such an environment. As a consequence, there is little evidence of any potentially harmful consequences of the substantial waiting time individuals can face before they can benefit from the intervention. Finally, there is also limited robust evidence of any indirect effects these interventions may have on the beneficiaries’ family members which, in turn, may lead to a potentially large underestimation of these interventions’ true impact.

As part of this research project, we propose to provide new evidence of these questions through the evaluation of a therapy-based intervention specifically designed to help individuals who have grown up in a family with an alcohol or drug problem. The intervention is implemented by the non-profit organization TUBA and is evaluated using a randomized controlled trial following a rotation design. We will measure the impact of the intervention on individuals’ psychological health, behavioral problems, and labor market attachment. "
