abstract: "Water suppliers are showing greater interest in using non-price mechanisms that can help encourage conservation. One such mechanism is water audits, which involve assessing customer behavior and the water efficiency of their home. The audits also provide tailored suggestions regarding how to reduce water use. Yet, very little is known about the efficacy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of water audits. This paper helps fill this research gap by implementing a natural field experiment in the United Kingdom. We randomly allocate 45,000 water customers to a control group or to groups that are provided with different encouragements to take-up an online water audit. Our analysis of the data will allow us to both study how to promote uptake of online water audits, in addition to the economic effects of water audits. "
