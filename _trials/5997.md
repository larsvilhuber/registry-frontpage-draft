abstract: "Many individuals state that they want to work but are neither working nor actively searching for work. This may reflect “rational discouragement,” in which they correctly anticipate that their private returns to search are low. If so, encouraging these individuals to increase search effort may have private costs and potentially even negative externalities due to congestion costs. Alternatively, some individuals may fail to search despite high private returns. We conduct a field experiment in Pakistan that randomly varies the process of applying for jobs. We use this to describe the marginal individuals induced to search by an easier process and identify their private returns to search.

We are registering this trial during the COVID-19 epidemic. Our intervention end date, trial end date, and final sample size will depend on the progress of the epidemic.
