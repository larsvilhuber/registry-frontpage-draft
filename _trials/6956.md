abstract: "Connecting theoretical expectations from the migration and protest literatures, the MOBILISE  project examines: a) whether similar factors drive the choice to migrate and/or protest at the individual level; b) how context affects this mobilisation; c) whether these choices are independent of each other or mutually reinforcing/ undermining.

As one part of the larger MOBILISE survey, fielded in four countries, we embed a framing experiment, which is interested in exploring whether different contexts or different issues will mobilise individuals to protest or migrate. We randomly assign respondents to one of four groups, and each group is asked whether they would consider protesting or migrating (in addition to letter writing and voting), when the problems of the country are framed in the context of government repression, economic issues, or representative problems (in addition to a control).
