abstract: "Refugees' decisions on whether to return are of great importance both to their country of origin and host country. These decisions affect the prospects of rebuilding the country of origin after a conflict ends. Return plans also affect refugees' incentives to invest in host-country specific human capital, thereby affecting their integration outcomes. While previous literature has largely focused on the role of safety after a conflict ends, also many other aspects can play an important role, including economic opportunities and perceived risk of a future conflict. In this Pre-analysis Plan, we describe how we study Ukrainian refugees' return decisions using a conjoint experiment among Ukrainian refugees in various European countries. Our conjoint experiment includes the following main dimensions: outcome of the war, when the war ends, security guarantees and the prospect of EU membership, as well as economic opportunities and corruption in Ukraine.
