abstract: "In this study we examine labor market prospects for international educational return migrants in Indonesia. The RCT was conducted in the 2nd half of 2015 and employs a correspondence study design to examine callback differences for different types of recent college graduates. More specifically, we look into callback differences between educational return migrants, persons who took their undergraduate degree abroad, and persons who graduated from Indonesian colleges. In total we sent out 12,000 resumes for 3,000 job vacancies. "
