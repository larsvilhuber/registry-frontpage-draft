abstract: "This study employs a discrete choice experiment in order to estimate the willingness to pay distribution for workplace happiness. Survey data is collected in the USA, Canada, and the UK. We ask a battery of questions about workplace happiness and other characteristics, which mirror the questions asked in the company reviewing process on a large jobs website.  We use this data to characterize any differences in response patterns in nationally representative samples as compared to the self-selected responders on the website.  We then use a choice experiment in order to estimate how much, if anything, workers are willing to pay in order to work at companies with a happier workforce.
