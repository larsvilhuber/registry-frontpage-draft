abstract: "To promote college access and affordability, education tax credits help with the cost of higher education by reducing the amount of tax owed by students or their families on their tax return. Yet, many eligible students (and their families) do not claim these credits or use them to offset future college expenses. The Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) and the Research, Applied Analytics, and Statistics division of the IRS (RAAS) are collaborating to test strategies to increase awareness of higher education financial assistance available through the Federal tax system. The study plans to build evidence on the impact of behaviorally-informed communications on increasing the take up of higher education tax credits, specifically the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) and, in turn, improving studentsâ€™ postsecondary outcomes."
