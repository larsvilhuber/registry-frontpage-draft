abstract: " Women smallholder farmers in low-income countries often have lower adoption rates of profitable agricultural technologies, in part due to unequal access to information about these technologies. In this experiment, we test variations of a female-led peer extension model, which provides training and free seeds, to promote the adoption of improved cassava and bean varieties among female farmers. We cross-randomize two components of the extension model in a 2x2 factorial design: 1) Household agricultural extension visits conducted by female (rather than male) trainers, and 2) community election of these trainers (rather than selection by local authorities). We also compare the results with a pure control group (receiving no extension at all) and a group that receives the seeds, but without training. We explore the impact each treatment has on adoption of the promoted technologies in the subsequent season. "
