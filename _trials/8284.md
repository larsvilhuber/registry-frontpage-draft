abstract: "Women are largely under-represented in leadership positions within organizations. In the European Union, it is estimated that only 19% of executives are women. Women’s low representation in leadership positions is in part influenced by social and cultural factors, such as gender discrimination, but also due to behavioural factors. There is evidence that shows that women are more averse to competition and risk and are less confident about their competences than their male counterparts. These factors further contribute to their under-representation in higher positions.
Several affirmative action measures have been identified to improve women’s ability to access opportunities, such as gender quotas, gender-specific training and preferential treatment. Among these measures, equal employment opportunity (EEO) claims in job ads are softer interventions that aim to encourage women to apply to the advertised positions.
The current study aims to test the effectiveness of equal employment opportunity claims in encouraging women to apply to demanding positions. 
Our outcome measures are: 1) whether EEO claims effectively encourage women to apply to leadership positions and 2) whether EEO claims affect women’s preferred leadership style when they are leaders. 
There is evidence that suggests that the values that leaders are expected to have are more closely associated with those that are more generally held by men.
The experiment is conducted online through a survey environment. There are no particular ethical issues related to this study, however ethical approval has been obtained (Joint Research Centre Ethics Review Board Ares(2021)6206758).
