abstract: "Past literature have found that people could infer traits and characteristics of the speaker just by hearing the voice. There have also been studies that found that different types of voices could elicit different decision making behaviours. However, the effect of children's voice on people's decision making have been rarely studied. Hence, this study aims to fill this gap by studying how children's voice could influence ones' intertemporal decision making. All participants will make a series of binary decisions in a standard time preference task, choosing between an immediate, smaller reward, versus a delayed larger reward. However, the type of voice that will hear the description of the delayed rewards will depend on the condition that they are randomly assigned to. Those in the Child condition will hear the delayed rewards being described using a child voice while those in the Adult condition will hear the same delayed rewards being described using an adult voice."
