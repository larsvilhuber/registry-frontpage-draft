abstract: "Existing research demonstrates sizable negative effects of high temperatures on labor productivity across skill types. In this study, we use experimental variation in room temperature to examine how the effects of work arrangements vary with higher costs of effort induced by higher temperatures. Motivated by findings that higher temperatures make coordination more difficult, our objective is to investigate how higher temperatures differentially affect team based production. "
