abstract: "This study aims to measure the impact of practicing football on a regular basis on the development of children's socio-emotional habilities, academic performance, well-being, and time-use. The intervention was implemented by Fútbol con Corazón, a non-governmental organization that promotes values and peaceful conflict resolutions through football practices. The study was carried out in nine training fields located in Barranquilla, Colombia. Training sessions took place twice per week, totalizing 16 hours per month. Excess demand made it possible for the authors randomly assign the available places among a population of eligible children (those aged 5 to 17 that lived near the training fields, and were currently enrolled in school) for 16 months. Randomization was done stratifying by training field and children's gender and age group. Total sample size consisted in 1649 children, which were assigned to the control or treatment group. The number of children assigned to each location depended on availability by the time of the evaluation. Additionally, a group of children were included in a waiting list in order to randomly replace children who were assigned to the treatment group and retired before the end of the period."
