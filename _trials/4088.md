abstract: "New forms of market mechanisms in which participants share products are becoming increasingly popular. In this project, we address the question whether not-for-profit initiatives in sharing economies, where at most informal rules are at play, can sustain in the long-run and to what extent free-riding occurs. The experimental intervention, which we preregister, is part of a larger study in which we collect field data. For the experimental part, a sample of local markets is randomized into a treatment and control group. After baseline field data have been collected, members of the treatment group receive a positive supply shock and we test whether this shock has a transitory or more permanent effect. "
