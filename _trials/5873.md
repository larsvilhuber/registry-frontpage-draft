abstract: "We report the results of a field experiment in which students are encouraged to exercise. We compare a no-incentive control with a treatment in which participants are paid per visit, and to two intermittent incentive schemes: monetary rewards at increasing intervals and monetary rewards with unpredictable timing. The advantage of irregular incentives, as already recognized in the psychology literature, is that they lead individuals to hold two contradictory expectations simultaneously: that of being rewarded and that of not being rewarded. Individuals continue to pursue the reinforcement because the anticipation of a reward is greater than the anticipation of no reward. With repeated experience, they learn to live with the paradox and to cope with the frustration of sometimes not being rewarded for a proper response. This mechanism may facilitate the maintenance of the habit over the long run, after the incentives have been removed. In line with this theory, we find the two intermittent incentive schemes increased participantsâ€™ frequency of exercising after the incentives were stopped and over an extended period of time more than the per-visit scheme.
