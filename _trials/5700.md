abstract: "We seek to understand the reaction of firm managers to publicly-available information on expectations about nominal exchange rates and inflation expectations. Using a panel of firms, and a random assignment, we tell firm managers what are the expected values of exchange rates in the reports of the central bank. We inquire how firm managers update their expectations and decisions on a variety of firm-level outcomes."
