abstract: "In Study 1 (exploratory) we elicit using verbal protocols how people value an annuity. Then in Study 2, we run an RTC where we use the information from Study 1 to design an anchoring intervention targeted to stimulate annuity demand. The intervention conveys information on expected longevity/quintiles of the distribution to participants and subsequently measures their intent to buy annuities. The intervention is tested in an online sample.  "
