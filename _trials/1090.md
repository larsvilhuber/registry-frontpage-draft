abstract: "The experiment is designed to study the effects of non-economic incentives in the form of motivating feedback, economic incentives (“pay for performance”) and the relation between them. The two manipulations we wish to study are increased economic incentives and increased positive feedback relative to the control groups. Our design will ensure that these two manipulated variables are the only thing separating the different groups from one another. We wish to study if there are causal connections related to these two manipulations. "
