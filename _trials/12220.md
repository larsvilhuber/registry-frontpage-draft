abstract: "Using a set of multi-year randomized control trials in Ethiopia, we investigate how tailored plot-specific information about soil conservation practices affects adoption and soil productivity implications in the medium run. The baseline was done in 2015. Outcomes were then collected in 2016, 2017, and 2021. GPS coordinates were collected at the farm level. "
