abstract: "We study the cooperative economic behavior of donations to provide public goods in response to disastrous events. We partnered with a charitable organization that aims to purchase and distribute surgical masks to smaller hospitals and facilities in areas hard-hit by COVID-19. We launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise funds for its operations in April 2020. We randomly rotated different versions of this campaign's GoFundMe webpage that vary in profile pictures, campaign descriptions, and operation updates. Our analysis has three components. First, we construct a measure of each version's trustworthiness based on the ratings provided by the subjects on Amazon MTurk. We then analyze the connection between the campaign page features and the level of trustworthiness. Second, we study how perceived trustworthiness affects contributions to the campaign. Finally, we extend our measure of trustworthiness to all campaigns that are related to PPE provision in the GoFundMe platform for generalization."
