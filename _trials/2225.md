abstract: "Community monitoring of health services is an intervention designed to help communities reach consensus on areas of health service provision that need improvement, and to monitor the progress of underperforming health care providers. In December 2016, community monitoring was scaled-up in four health districts in North West (NW) Cameroon. The 84 health facilities included in the scale-up were randomized into two groups. The standard community monitoring protocol in which both men and women are invited to community meetings was implemented in the first 42 health facilities. In the second group of 42 facilities, only women from the community were invited to participate. During each community meeting, five health system indicators are selected as health system improvement priorities. The primary outcome that will be assessed from the randomized community monitoring study is whether the priorities selected in meetings containing only women are more consistent with women’s health service improvement priorities than those selected in mixed-gender meetings. Gender priorities will be assessed using a household survey, which will ask men and women to list their top five health priorities. We will also assess whether women’s health service use increases in communities where women’s only community meetings were conducted relative to the change in health services observed in communities where standard community monitoring took place.
