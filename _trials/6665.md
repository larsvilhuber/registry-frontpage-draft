abstract: "Since the early 2000s, political polarization has skyrocketed among US voters, who are now more divided than ever on a diverse array of social, cultural, and economic issues (Abramowitz, 2018; Gentzkow, 2016; Klein, 2020).  Political identity is powerful enough to govern the behavior and the preferences of Americans on both sides of the political spectrum. Recent studies have shown that, due to partisan identification, voters may support policies that oppose their own economic interests (Bonomi et al., 2020; Dokshin, 2020; Grossman and Helpman, 2019). This paper will test whether political identity distorts votersâ€™ responses to new information in the context of healthcare policies in the US. We will conduct an online survey experiment in which we cross-randomize exposure to i) an information treatment on life expectancy in the US (compared to other countries, over time) and ii) a partisan prime and document how these two forces influence voter preferences, beliefs, and values."
