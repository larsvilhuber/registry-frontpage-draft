abstract: "There is substantial evidence to show that transportation poses a barrier for low-income individuals searching for jobs, especially for those residing in neighborhoods further away from job opportunities (Phillips, 2014). If an individual can’t pay for transportation to job interviews or training, job search intensity wanes and poverty persists. 

Several researchers have studied the impact of free public transportation on people’s travel habits, finding that immediate transit use and mobility increase significantly. For example, one field experiment that provided free public transportation to a large group of employed individuals found a 12% increase in overall travel and a 23% increase in travel during off-peak hours (Bull et al., 2021). Another large-scale experiment that provided free transit to individuals with low income documented a doubling of transit use (Brough et al., 2022). These results show high potential for an uptake in transit usage and could suggest an even larger jump for a low-income population. However, a follow-up paper showed limited effects of the transit subsidy on hours worked (Brough et al., 2023).  Null results for employment may have occurred because that study sample was too detached from the labor market or because free transit affects employment outcomes beyond hours worked and wage rates. The Wilson Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunities (LEO) has partnered with the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) and Uplift Northwest (Uplift), a temporary staffing agency serving a population of overwhelmingly low-income and/or homeless people, to bridge this gap by pairing free transit to people enrolled in Uplift’s job matching programs and studying its impact on employment and self-sufficiency outcomes using Uplift’s detailed data on participants’ interactions with the labor market.

LEO will be conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate this program. Clients of Uplift who consent to participation will be randomly assigned to receive either a one-time $10 transit card or a fully subsidized transit card. Outcomes of interest include transit usage and labor market outcomes. We will also measure benefits utilization (such as SNAP and TANF) and housing stability."
