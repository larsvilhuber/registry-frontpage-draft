abstract: "The Londö project provides temporary employment to vulnerable people through participation in a public works scheme. The phasing of Londö follows an adaptive schedule that takes into account geographic characteristics, existing infrastructure, and issues related to security and logistics. Work is being carried out by teams of 25 beneficiaries headed by a team leader recruited locally. Each sous-préfecture benefits from the manpower of 20 teams for 40 days in two successive campaigns with cohorts of 250 beneficiaries each. 

Beneficiaries are selected through lotteries open to all individuals willing to participate. Each sous-prefecture runs two lotteries (one for each Londö campaign per sous-prefecture) during which 250 beneficiaries are selected for a main list and 50 for a waitlist. Work teams of 25 workers are formed according to the lottery ranking (individuals ranked 1 to 25 are in team 1, those ranked from 26 to 50 are in team 2, etc.). Each worker receives a daily wage of about $3 for the 40-day contract period and a bicycle. The low daily stipend promotes self-selection towards the poorest and most vulnerable. In addition, each worker receives a bicycle, which he or she can keep after successful completion of the 40-day contract period (during the 40-day period, the bike formally remains the property of the project). 

The random selection of Londö project beneficiaries is exploited to design a rigorous impact evaluation methodology and answer some of the following research questions:
•	How do Londö household-level impacts differ depending on whether a woman or a man participates in a public works project?
•	Do female participants benefit in terms of increasing bargaining power or decision-making in response to participating in the Londö project?
•	How does participating in a public works program change attitudes towards the state in the context of low public service delivery, poverty, and marginalized populations?
•	How does the impact of a cash-for-work program depend on participants’ individual characteristics (e.g. by gender, age, household background)?
•	Does women’s participation in a public works program have any negative consequences such as increased GBV?
•	Do the asset transfers alter the relationship between spouses, in particular when women are the recipients, given the possibility that a bicycle may impact the economic opportunities available, access to services, etc.?
•	Does access to a bike reduce the gender gap in mobility?"
