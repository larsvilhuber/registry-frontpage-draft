abstract: "We run a natural field experiment with an appliance retailer in the United Kingdom. Randomly selected subjects receive a discount or different types of vouchers that need to be redeemed before check-out. We vary the level of difficulty to redeem the voucher and analyze its effect on redemption rates. A subset of subjects receive an additional intervention reminding them to redeem the voucher before check-out. "
