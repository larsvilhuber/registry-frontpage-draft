abstract: "Two major causes of cognitive biases are insufficient levels of attention (i.e. miserly processing) and anticipatory utility. Mindfulness training, through its emphasis on developing greater levels of "awareness” and “presence”, could have the potential to diminish the influence of both these causes and improve individual decision-making and welfare. Our RCT design makes use of a mindfulness treatment intervention and an active control to analyse the effects of meditation on these two types of cognitive biases (measured using experimental methods on an online platform).
