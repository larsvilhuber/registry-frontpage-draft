abstract: "Learning losses resulting from school closures are among the most severe global challenges to medium and long-term recovery from COVID-19. School closures in the first two years of the pandemic lasted roughly twice as long in developing countries compared with advanced economies. With the existing structural fault lines in its educational system, Nepal and Pakistan are two such countries staring at this catastrophe today after keeping their schools closed continuously for a long period of time. This challenge is more acute among candidates taking the end-of-secondary school exams. We have developed and adapted a set of audio lessons (podcasts) to be delivered via the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system. IVR is an automated phone system technology that allows incoming callers to access information via a voice response system of pre-recorded messages without having to speak to an attendant (tutor), as well as to utilize menu options via keypad selection. The intervention will set up an IVR-based toll-free line to deliver English and Mathematics lessons to students who will take the SEE/SSC in 2024, (who will be in ninth grade during the intervention). There will be weekly lesson plans for both subjects (Mathematics and English) that will be accessible during the intervention period. The intervention will also address issues related to studentsâ€™ educational aspirations and hope. In a separate treatment arm, students will also receive over-the-phone support from a tutor in addition to IVR-based intervention."
