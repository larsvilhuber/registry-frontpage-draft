abstract: "An extensive literature in psychology has developed standard manipulations to increase, as well as decrease, empathic reaction. The objective of this experiment is to investigate whether these standard manipulations can succeed in increasing/decreasing empathic reaction to a video that could naturally be used in a campaign to raise funds for children who are confronting serious illnesses."
