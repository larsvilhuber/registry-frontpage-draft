abstract: "Across the world the legacy of political violence persists for people often affecting their lives in adverse ways.  Past events of political violence often associated with elections continue to threaten people affecting their wellbeing and identities.  Existing scholarship shows that the legacy of political violence can inversely affect people's wellbeing and also their identities pushing people to feel less satisfied and to identity more closely with their ethnic group.  By reducing wellbeing and causing people to identity more with their ethnic group the legacy of political violence can in turn increase the probability of further political violence.  We test these ideas in Africa focusing on a unique comparative analysis in West and East Africa both of which are regions that have experienced past political violence and thus carry its legacy.  We specifically examine the legacy of political violence, wellbeing, and ethnic identities.  We conduct an experimental analysis treating randomly selected respondents in Cote d'Ivoire and Uganda and treating some with a statement about the legacy of political violence with a control group assigned no statement.  We have several claims: (i) respondents treated with legacy of political violence will have lower levels of wellbeing than those not treated; (ii) the treatment effect on wellbeing will be relatively larger for women than men; (iii) respondents treated with political violence will have more ethnic than national identities.  As an extension and for purposes of comparison we will test these claims in a nationally representative survey (filled by yougov) of Americans to see if the results are consistent.  "
