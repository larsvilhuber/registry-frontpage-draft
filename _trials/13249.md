abstract: "Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is widely recognized as an effective treatment for depression; however, its accessibility remains a challenge. To address this, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally attuned nurse-led didactic CBT manual in reducing depressive symptoms for Chinese individuals with depression. A parallel-arm, randomized controlled trial was conducted in two psychiatric clinics in Hong Kong, comparing five weekly sessions of group CBT delivered by psychiatric nurses to usual care. Out of the 110 outpatients who provided consent, 56 received CBT with 100% attendance rate. After five weeks, significant reductions in depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 scores: β=-1.81, 95% CI=-3.34 to -0.29, p=0.021) and anxiety symptoms (GAD-7 scores: β=-1.39, 95% CI=-2.73 to -0.05, p=0.043) were observed. Additionally, participants reported increased subjective happiness (SHS scores: β=2.33, 95% CI=1.30 to 3.36, p<0.001) and improved psychological well-being (psychological subscale of WHOQOL-BREF: β=0.77, 95% CI=0.01 to 1.53, p=0.047). The study demonstrates the feasibility and potential benefits of integrating nurse-led didactic CBT into routine psychiatric outpatient care for individuals with depression. "
