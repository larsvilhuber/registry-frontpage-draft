abstract: "With this project we propose to investigate how providing information on more fragile groups in society will affect the allocation of a scarce resource. Scarcity is defined in reference to the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic in the institutional context of Italy, which has been among the most struck countries by the pandemic. 
The research aims to analyze if and how, in political communication, different groups of voters react to different messages when dealing with the allocation of public resources. We define fragility as a function of the resource that needs to be allocated. In particular we focus on four types of fragility: a health fragility, a labor market fragility, a housing fragility, and an economic fragility. Each fragility is linked to a resource: vaccine against COVID-19, ban on layoffs, ban on evictions, governmental non-repayable grants to firms. Respondents to the survey are asked to rank which of the six proposed groups should be prioritized.
