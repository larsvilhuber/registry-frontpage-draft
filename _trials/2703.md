abstract: "How do you move from a low information-low accountability political equilibrium to one where voters are informed and politicians feel pressure to perform well?  This paper explores two main constraints to this equilibrium shift in the context of a national scale up of a political information campaign in Sierra Leone.  The first captures general barriers to scaling a controlled demonstration pilot to serve a much broader population, and the second asks when politicians have incentives (or not) to participate in initiatives that inform voters.
