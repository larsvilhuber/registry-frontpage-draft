abstract: "This project studies the willingness to pay taxes to finance a public good when one has the possibility of being self-reliant, that is, being able to satisfy a shared need such as education, health care or security individually through the consumption of a private substitute good. In this setting, we would have a private-public goods game in a context where participants use their political voice (vote for the tax rate) and can have an exit strategy (private substitute). We hypothesize that the introduction of a private good may generate obstacles to the financing of the public good, decreasing the willingness to pay taxes for those who have individual incentives to opt for the private good. 
We compare treatments where the endowments are homogeneous with those where participants receive a high, a medium and a low endowment. In both scenarios, we want to study how the decrease in the cost of being self-reliant, understood as the decrease in the price of the private good, changes the willingness of participants to pay taxes. In the specific case of heterogeneous endowment, we study how an unequal distribution of income affects the decision of participants regarding the tax rate to vote compared to the case of homogeneous endowment. In this scenario, we also analyze the effect on inequality, as the private good benefits some participants more than others, given the different levels of endowment."
