abstract: "Technology adoption often requires investments over time. As new information about the costs and benefits of investment is realized, agents may prefer to abandon a technology that appeared profitable at the time of take-up. This re-optimization can reduce the cost-effectiveness of adoption subsidies. We use a field experiment with two stages of randomization to generate exogenous variation in the payoffs associated with take-up and subsequent investment in a new technology: a tree species that provides private fertilizer benefits to adopting farmers. Our empirical results show high rates of abandoning the technology, even after paying a positive price to take it up. The experimental variation offers a novel source of identification for a structural model of intertemporal decision making under uncertainty. Estimation results indicate that the farmers experience idiosyncratic shocks to net payoffs after take-up, which increase take-up but lower average per farmer tree survival. We simulate counterfactual outcomes under different levels of uncertainty and observe that farmers with high returns are able to self-select at take-up only when the level of uncertainty is relatively low. Thus, uncertainty provides an additional explanation for why many subsidized technologies may not be utilized even when take-up is high."
