abstract: "This experiment measures loss and risk aversion in the context of entitled and unentitled income in order to understand tax evasion with relation to mental accounting. Participants will be asked to make decisions regarding paying taxes while taking into account various factors like tax, audit, and fine rates. Subject-specific loss aversions and risk aversions are elicited through binary lotteries.
