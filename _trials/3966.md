abstract: "The goal of the experiment is to examine whether there is a significant difference in effort and performance between genders, depending on the gender of the subject's "main competitors." Previous studies showed that there are significant gender differences in participation and performance due to differences in attitudes toward competition. In this experiment we focus on how subjects' performance is affected by the gender composition of previous high-performing subjects whose performance information is highlighted prior to and during the task. We use a simple online game with randomized treatment to test for gender differences in outcomes.
