abstract: "This project studies redistributive preferences under moral costs. Particularly, we seek to assess if people tend to sabotage lucky and dishonestly help unlucky fellows. Therefore, we conduct a laboratory experiment with two treatments -- the lottery and the tournament treatment. Subjects are either exposed to a pair where inequity was generated by a lottery or by an effort-based tournament and then have to report die roll outcomes that determine additional payments to the assigned loser and winner. These die rolls are not observable by the experimenter and subjects can, hence, manipulate the payoffs for each randomly assigned pair member without any personal financial incentive. "
