abstract: "Rates of teenage pregnancy, early marriage, HIV, and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) remain the highest in the world in Sub-Saharan Africa, despite decades of public health interventions and research. In Tanzania, 60 percent of females have sex by the age of 18, yet less than 10 percent of adolescents aged 15-19 use any modern contraceptive method (DHS 2010). Typically, family planning and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) programs combine interventions on the supply side (e.g., access to contraceptives) and demand side (e.g.,  education). Because these programs bundle supply and demand side services, it is impossible to discern which type of intervention is more effective at improving SRH outcomes. Moreover, even though males often control decisions around contraceptive use and SRH behavior, these programs target only females, potentially dampening their effectiveness. We are implementing a randomized controlled trial (RCT) targeting  both female and male adolescents. This RCT will allow us to causally identify the differential impacts of demand side and supply side interventions and better understand the role males play in affecting SRH outcomes."
