abstract: "Although crop insurance is an important risk management strategy for farmers to secure their income stability, the adoption of crop insurance has been extremely low. Recent studies have highlighted the significant role of pay-at-harvest premiums in take-up rate for crop insurance. However, pay-at-harvest faces a major challenge of default. To address such issue, this research focuses on a key scientific question: “What is the best timing of premium payments to boost farmers’ demand for crop insurance and mitigate payment default?”. To answer this question, this research evaluates and compares the causal impacts of different timings of premium payments on farmers’ take-up of crop insurance (rice insurance) and payment default using a field experiment in Vietnam. The field experiment is carried out in 41 Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLAs) over two rice seasons to examine the persistent impacts of the interventions. The combination of delayed premium payments through VSLAs raises the social cost of default and reduces transaction cost as premiums are collected via VSLAs."
