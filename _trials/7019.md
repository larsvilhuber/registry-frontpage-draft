abstract: "We study the extent and type of ethnic and gender discrimination that exists on two of the most widely used "P2P" (person to person) online marketplaces in France: an online classified advertisements website and a ride sharing platform. The first phase involves data scraping in which we collect large amounts of data on real ads and rides that are publicly available through the platforms’ APIs. This will allow us to better understand the characteristics of the two markets and provide correlational evidence on the existence of discrimination and its magnitude in different submarkets. As is typical in the literature using French data, we will categorize the first names (in the case of classified ads) to proxy for the gender and/or minority status (supposed non-French origin) of the buyers and sellers, as it is illegal to categorize ethnic status in France. Using insights from this observational data, we will then implement a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which we will create sets of fictitious profiles (both buyers and sellers of fictitious goods and both fictitious drivers and passengers) that are closely matched on all observable characteristics but differ on the supposed minority status or gender. This will allow us to provide causal evidence on whether discrimination exists in these online marketplaces. Furthermore, by experimentally manipulating the fictitious buyer and seller profiles on other dimensions and exploiting existing market heterogeneity, we aim to better understand the ways in which online markets can be designed in order to minimize the negative manifestations of discrimination."
