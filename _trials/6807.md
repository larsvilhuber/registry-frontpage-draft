abstract: "The Paris Agreement aims at limiting the global average temperature increase to well below 2°C above preindustrial levels. A key component of the agreement are “nationally determined contributions” (NDC). For this, non-state actors such as civil society groups, economic actors, and subnational and local actors (e.g. Municipalities) play a decisive role. They can either directly reduce greenhouse gas emissions by additional voluntary activities, or indirectly by influencing the climate protection activities of individual actors. However, a successful integration of non-state actors must happen within the larger framework of the global climate regime. Literature (Johnson, Schroeder, and Toly 2015; Ostrom 2010; Romero-Lankao and Hardoy 201; Janicke and Quitzow, 2017) has already stressed the importance of a “polycentric” or multi‐level climate governance as an enabler for a transformation climate governance.  As the role of non-state actors within reaching the climate goals has received little attention within research, our research focuses on the lowest rungs of the multi‐level climate governance ladder and analyses feedback loops between local non-state actors, here municipalities, and individual climate protection activities. With a framed-field experiment we aim to analyze the relationship between individual commitment to climate protection and the commitment of other fellow citizens, and the interaction between individual commitment and municipal engagement. Special attention is paid on potential crowding in or crowding out effects."
