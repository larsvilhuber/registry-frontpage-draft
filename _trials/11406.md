abstract: "We conduct a field experiment in cooperation with an energy efficiency assistance program in Germany. As part of that program, the participating low-income households receive a letter informing them about eligibility for a voucher for replacing their old refrigerator against a new, efficient one. We complement that information letter by three types of nudges. Following classic behavioral economic research, the nudges introduce a gain vs. a loss framing to the information letter. Further, we adopt simplified versions (both in terms of icons and in terms of a checklist) to ease the cognitive burden the low-income households may experience. We study the effect of the nudges on (i) the likelihood that the household requests the voucher and (ii) the likelihood that the household invests in energy efficiency. "
