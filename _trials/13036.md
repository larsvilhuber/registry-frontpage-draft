abstract: "We aim to elicit the participantsâ€™ subjective risk perceptions concerning heatstroke and related ambiguity under different preventive behaviors through a web survey. The sample will comprise people of various ages, genders, educational backgrounds, and income levels. We will examine how subjective risk perception of heatstroke and its ambiguity relate to preventive behaviors for heatstroke. Additionally, we will examine the heterogeneity of risk perception and its ambiguity among the participants.
