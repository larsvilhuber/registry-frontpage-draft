abstract: "We explore whether and how individuals can design recommendations for the play of a variety of different two action, two player games. The recommendations are elicited in the form of probability distributions for each player over the possible action profiles of each game. The games are then played by programmed robot players who consider the recommendations made and decide, on a basis of best-response analysis, whether or not to follow the recommendations. The individuals providing the recommendations (the subjects) earn a baseline payment per game and they receive further rewards if their recommendations are followed by the robot players. This experimental design enables insights into how well the designers (subjects) understand the strategic incentives at play in various two-player, two action games including Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, Battle of the Sexes and Chicken. In some of these games, there are multiple recommendation systems that the robot players will agree to follow, that is there, are multiple correlated equilibria of these games that can be selected by the designer. One aim of this research is to determine whether subjects can learn to implement the most efficient of these correlated equilibria in their choice of recommendation systems.

This experimental design differs from the traditional method of collecting data on the play of two player, two action games in that we use only a single player who designs a recommendation system for the play of the game by robot players. Nevertheless, we view this design as complementary to evidence from the traditional method and may yield evidence of greater strategic sophistication by our single, recommendation designing subjects since our experimental design reduces strategic uncertainty.
