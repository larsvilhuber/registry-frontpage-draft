abstract: "Emergency financial assistance (EFA) provides funds to individuals who need it to stay afloat with expenses like rent or utility bills. In many cases, these funds are distributed on behalf of individuals to an appropriate third party (e.g., in the case of a rent payment, EFA would be transferred directly to a clientâ€™s landlord). What is the impact of changing this method of delivery and instead providing EFA payments directly to clients? Through a partnership with Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Galveston Houston (CCGH), this study evaluates how payment delivery could affect outcomes like those related to housing, health, crime, and financial security."
