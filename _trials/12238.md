abstract: "We study the role of idea exchange through communication on creativity in a co-working space. We introduce a communication-facilitating app for the part of users in a co-working space and provide a matching service through the app. By examining the facilitated communications with previously unknown partners by the app and the change in creativity, we can examine the impact of communications on creativity."
