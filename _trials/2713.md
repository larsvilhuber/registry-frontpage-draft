abstract: "Social media has increasingly become an important source of news consumption, however, limited evidence exists on its causal effect. I will conduct a natural field experiment to measure the effects of news consumption on political opinions and political behavior. The main outcomes are whether participants are persuaded by news they were randomly exposed to as a result of the intervention and whether being offered content which matches the participantâ€™s ideology increases polarization. The results will be used to compare models explaining how individuals learn when consuming news from an outlet with an ideological slant. Specifically, I will test if consumers are affected by the slant of an outlet and whether consumers suffer from confirmation bias and are persuaded only by news matching their opinion. "
