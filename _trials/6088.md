abstract: "COVID-19 related school closures in Pakistan put girls’ enrollment at risk due to three main exclusion mechanisms: (1) income shocks may interact with gender bias in household investment in girl’s education, (2) shift in intra-household roles which, if become permanent, may prompt girls’ dropouts, and (3) perceptions of heightened risk of attending school which have been shown to be biased against girls.  This RCT will evaluate interventions that target these three different mechanisms by running text messaging and a social mobilization campaign in the form three different treatments: (1) campaign to promote girls participation in distance education and to return to school when schools reopen, (2) campaign to promote enrollment in the girls’ stipend program in place in 16 districts in Punjab,  and (3), when schools reopen, a campaign to promote awareness of the safety measures in place at schools."
