abstract: "How do communication and presentation skills impact job-finding and labor market search? Can training improve communication and presentation skills? The role of communication is vital in improving social mobility and determining economic outcomes such as job-finding and productivity, as well as determinants of managerial performance  We propose to conduct an experiment to determine (1) if communication training can impact job- finding rates and (2) which aspects of communication matter most. We will conduct the experiment partnering with TalkMeUp, an AI based software company focused on communication training, as well as Goodwill."
