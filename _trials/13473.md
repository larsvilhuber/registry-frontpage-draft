abstract: "We conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of gender norms training on workplace dynamics. Specifically, we aim to evaluate its impact on gender attitudes, job satisfaction, incidences of harassment and discrimination, employee turnover rates, as well as levels of cooperation and productivity within the organization. We will measure whether this training program influences gender norms in a firm environment, leading to enhanced collaboration, increased opportunities for female employment, and heightened overall productivity. We employ a comprehensive methodology encompassing self-reported surveys, and incentivized experiments to measure the outcomes."
