abstract: "We conduct large-scale surveys of Italian citizens and information treatments about a very large EU-financed transfer scheme (the Next Generation EU) to understand a) if and why there exists a gender gap in policy literacy and b) how policy knowledge affects trust and attitudes towards the EU.
In the first part of the analysis, we want to understand whether women are more or less informed than men, if so, whether the gaps are driven by differences in confidence or actual knowledge gaps. We also aim to test whether women respond differently to communication about the program based on the type of information they receive. 
To do so, we field a survey assessing policy knowledge regarding the  Next Generation EU and conduct a survey experiment where we randomize the availability of "I Dont Know" options for all the policy knowledge-assessment questions, to evaluate the role of gender differences in confidence. 
In a subsequent wave of the survey, we provide information treatments to see to what extent individuals learn about the policy and if there are differential effects depending on the framing of information they receive. Furthermore, thanks to geographic variation in the data, we investigate whether living in areas that are more vs. less intensively treated by the policy affect perceptions and attitudes and if the gender gradient in knowledge persists across areas. We also investigate whether the provided information affect trust and attitudes towards the EU, and whether women respond differently also along this margin.
