abstract: "Regulation is part of the game when firms may falsely signal the environmental performance of a good. The goal of this regulation - sometimes referred to as truth-in-advertising laws - is to deter misleading claims. Following a Beckerian approach, the probability of detection and the fine size are considered by sellers, who then (mis)act accordingly. This project builds on a model which refines the actions of sellers and buyers in the market depending on monetary incentives, beliefs and extra motives (e.g. lying aversion). The equilibria obtained are tested in a laboratory experiment with real commodities and actual purchasing decisions. Different treatments manipulate the probability of detection and aim to establish causality in individual decision responses to stimuli. Behaviourally founded results will provide insights for optimal deterrent policy in the context of green advertising."
