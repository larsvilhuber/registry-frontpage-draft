abstract: "In this study the World Bank's Africa Gender Innovation Lab (GIL) will evaluate the impact of a mobile-savings product with and without an in-person savings-focused business training program for micro-entrepreneurs in Tanzania, about one year after the end of business training. The program was implemented by Technoserve between August and December 2016.  Six-months after the intervention ended results show that women save substantially more through the mobile account, and that the business training bolstered this effect. Women also obtain more microloans through the mobile account, an additional service provided by the product. The business training further led to an increase in the business practices of the women. These results are accompanied by improvements in womenâ€™s empowerment and subjective well-being."
