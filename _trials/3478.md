abstract: "Significant heterogeneity in financial literacy proficiency among students prevails, with an important group of the population not reaching the minimum performance level. Including differentiation practices in financial education may solve for these differences. Using two waves of a large-scale randomized experiment involving 69 schools and approximately 2,400 students, we evaluate the effect of within-class group formation and differentiated instruction on financial knowledge and behavior of eighth and ninth grade students in secondary education in the Flemish community of Belgium. Schools were randomly assigned to a control group (no financial literacy education) and treatment groups. The treatment groups received an intense four-hour financial education course which ran independently of the teacher, and where students worked together in groups of two. We examine the impact of group formation and differentiated instruction by comparing test scores of students for which teachers implemented heterogeneous group formation, homogenous group formation or homogenous group formation with differentiated instruction.
