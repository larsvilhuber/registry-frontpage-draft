abstract: "Affective polarization and intolerance are on the rise in many democracies around the world.  Interpersonal contact with outgroup members has been hypothesized to reduce prejudice (Allport 1954). Empirical studies have by and large supported the contact hypothesis, but results vary dramatically across studies, making it urgent to study the conditions under which contact works (Pettigrew and Tropp 2006; Levy Paluck et al 2019). Allport (1954) hypothesized that the effectiveness of interpersonal contact is a function of contextual factors. Such factors include equality of status in the interaction. There is practically no experimental research testing the hypothesis that equality moderates the effectiveness of interpersonal contact in reducing prejudice. 

The present study aims to contribute to the literature by studying the moderating effect of equality in the interaction on the effectiveness of contact, in an experimental design. Specifically, we assign participants to pairwise interactions where they are asked to collaborate under conditions of randomly assigned equal or unequal status. One of our main dependent variables  is tolerance for those with different political preferences. Other dependent variables include trust and attitudes towards democracy. They also include revealed preferences measured through a dictator games, the opportunity to donate to an NGO that fight corruption but has been heavily criticized by the current President, and well as willingness to attend a meeting containing either in-group or out-group members. All the interpersonal contact takes place online via a proprietary chat software.

We further study the effect of inequality in socioeconomic status (SES) on the effectiveness of interpersonal contact to increase tolerance (reduce polarization), as well as to affect the above mentioned outcomes. In this case, we randomize whether or not participants in the pairwise interaction are informed about each other’s SES. This information consists of a set of photographs of a house’s or apartment’s façade, kitchen, and bedroom, typical to the participant’s SES category. In this branch of our study, we randomly assign whether participants in a pair are both shown, or both not shown, such pictures. The online mode of interaction makes it possible to test the causal effect of learning vs not learning about one’s interlocutor’s SES. Specifically, we hypothesize that contact will increase political tolerance of the higher-SES party in the interaction, but it will have smaller (or perhaps negative) effects on the political tolerance of the lower-SES person. 

In sum, our research makes the following main contributions:
1.	Investigate the causal role of equality vs inequality in the interaction as a scope condition for the effectiveness of interpersonal contact at reducing political polarization and intolerance.
2.	Investigate the causal role of learning about the SES of one’s interlocutor on the effectiveness of interpersonal contact at reducing political polarization and intolerance.
3.	Test the contact hypothesis in an online chat environment.
4.	Test the contact hypothesis with measures of actual behavior as outcomes.
5.	Test whether being exposure to a video emphasizing a common national identity for Mexicans (vis a vis a placebo video) decreases the salience of particularistic differences between subgroups of Mexicans, reducing affective polarization, increasing identification with the nation and other people from the same country, and increasing trust in others---especially fellow country people.
