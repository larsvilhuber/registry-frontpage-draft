abstract: "This research investigates ways to overcome gender bias and stereotyping (and ideally other biases such as those based on race) to create more inclusive work environments. To date, existing research has primarily focused on proving that bias exists and that it affects peopleâ€™s outcomes. In order to reduce inequality, however, research must move beyond identifying biases and their consequences to identifying ways to overcome these biases and thereby make organizational cultures more inclusive. This is our goal. We examine whether a novel bias intervention we have designed leads to actual behavior change that can have a meaningful impact on addressing inclusivity in the workplace. "
