abstract: "We will conduct a survey experiment to investigate how perceptions of parental attitudes toward school-age children affect their expectations regarding parental labor supply decisions. By examining parental attitudes towards career adjustments for child rearing especially in terms of time investment in child's educational activities, the survey delves into perceived gender differences in various attitudes including educational effectiveness of parental involvement, enjoyment of time spent with children, willingness/altruism toward spending time with children, and the impact of family structure ideals on career trajectories. Data will also be collected on demographics, actual parental involvement in education, and views on socio-economic opportunity and inequality. "
