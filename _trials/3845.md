abstract: "Excessive alcohol consumption has been shown to instigate violence in public spaces, particularly in and around alcohol-serving establishments. Policies that ban or restrict alcohol have been shown to work but impose restrictions on the community and may be unenforceable. Less evidence exists regarding policies that raise awareness among bartenders and patrons of the adverse consequences of excessive alcohol consumption. In this study we evaluate an intervention conducted by the Bogotá mayor’s office and Colombia’s largest brewery to empower bartenders, provide didactic materials to bar patrons, and offer food and non-alcoholic drinks to bar patrons. The intervention has two primary objectives: i) reduce the negative consequences associated with the overconsumption of alcohol and ii) defuse conflicts between bartenders and patrons, and among patrons, that might escalate to violence within and around bars. Our unit of observation is the street segment, nested within police quadrants. We first randomize 221 police quadrants into treatment and control groups. Second, in the 109 treated quadrants, we randomly select eligible street segments with alcohol-serving establishments to receive the intervention. This design captures both direct effects of the intervention for street segments within treated police quadrants and potential spillover effects across police quadrants. "
