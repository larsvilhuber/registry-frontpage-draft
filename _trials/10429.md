abstract: "In this RCT, we investigate how firms create and manage wealth in emerging markets by leveraging digital tools and technologies in their businesses. In emerging markets, business digitization can be a key strategy for firms to increase wealth. We have partnered with one of the largest banks in East Africa, Equity Group Foundation, to measure the economic impact of an innovative digital skills training. In our randomized control trial (RCT) we investigate how access to and knowledge of digital tools and technology can impact both firm performance outcomes and access to financial services. While technology has great potential in creating and managing wealth, many small-scale entrepreneurs in developing countries lack hands-on knowledge of how to leverage them for growth. This lack of ‘digital capital’ can be a significant constraint to growth in today’s digitized society. Our research aims to shed light on this problem by examining the effectiveness of a novel digital skills intervention, which combines 1) practical in-class training of business digitization, and 2) in-depth follow-up technical assistance on digital tools. By building skills and confidence in these digital business practices, our intervention aims at improving firm outcomes of entrepreneurs as well as facilitate access to financial services such as loans.
