abstract: "We provide causal evidence of how information about an individual’s implicit beliefs about their financial abilities (“confidence awareness”) affects their real financial behaviours. We first use a novel test to measure participants’ implicit beliefs about their financial abilities. Half of the participants will then receive their test result. We then measure actual performance on a financial literacy test and behaviour in an incentivised investment decision. This document outlines our plan for data analysis."
