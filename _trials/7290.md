abstract: "We test whether portraying a social issue as more or less controversial provides more or less focus on the corresponding issue relative to an issue that is fundamentally portrayed as noncontroversial. To this end, we set up a model describing how political choice may be affected by focusing and provide an experiment that aims to provide evidence for the main prediction of the model."
