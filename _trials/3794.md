abstract: "This paper reports results from a large-scale randomized experiment evaluating whether a Supported Employment rehabilitation intervention strategy can improve labor market opportunities for young adults on disability pension better than regular vocational rehabilitation. The Supported Employment intervention utilizes a caseworker as back-up for the individual during training to reduce employersâ€™ risks when hiring an individual with unclear productivity. In total, 1,063 individuals were randomly assigned between interventions. The main results show that 18 months after the start of the project, participants with Supported Employment have work rates that are approximately 10 percentage points higher than participants who received regular rehabilitation."
