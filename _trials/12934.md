abstract: "This RCT aims to measure the impact of a 24-month STEM training initiative designed for first-generation women engineering students in India. Deployed nationwide by an Indian education start-up, the program employs a holistic strategy to overcome multifaceted barriers faced by women in STEM fields. By fostering a women-only environment, providing online accessibility, and emphasizing self-directed learning, the initiative seeks to address cultural, institutional, and psychological challenges hindering women's success in STEM. This study will evaluate two cohorts of the program: 2024-2026 and 2025-2027. The study, spanning 2023-2028, aims to evaluate the WE program's efficacy in enhancing participants' technical and higher-order skills, ultimately influencing their labor market outcomes once these women graduate college.  The study will be conducted in India. The data collection will predominately be online.
