abstract: "This paper uses data from a randomized experiment with around 1700 households in rural China to study the effect on insurance take-up of offering a menu of insurance contracts rather than a single one. Surprisingly, I find that offering more choices increases the take-up rate of the basic contract (lowest premium and payout) by 30%, while only a small proportion of farmers choose contracts with higher premiums and payouts. Information inference explanation is ruled out by the fact that the effect holds even when all farmers are aware of the existence of all contracts. A policy implication is that strategically offering a menu of contracts can be an easy and cheap way to improve insurance take-up.
