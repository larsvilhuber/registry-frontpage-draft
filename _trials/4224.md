abstract: "A preponderance of research in household finance suggests that
households are typically not fully informed about financial products
before making an investment decision. This shrouding does not
disappear with greater competition among product suppliers, and
supply-side regulation that mandate disclosures do not achieve
intended objectives. In this experiment in the field, we test whether
aiding households to ask the right question when a product is being
sold can enable better purchase decisions. This demand-side
intervention, if successful, can unshroud product features in a way that
corrects market failures, thus improving both household welfare and
prevent suppliers from creating suboptimal financial products."
