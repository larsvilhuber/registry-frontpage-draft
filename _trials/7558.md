abstract: "Understanding how to improve the performance of frontline bureaucrats is critical, since they are ultimately responsible for the delivery of public services and the implementation of nearly all development programs.  Adopting private sector management practices like performance-based incentives is challenging with frontline bureaucrats, since they often collect the data that is used to assess their performance and serve multiple policy objectives.   We partner with a government department of an Indian state to redesign their performance assessment and data collection systems, and leverage this setting to  experimentally study how incentives for performance and truthful reporting  dynamically shape bureaucrat performance and truthfulness.
