abstract: "This study tests three different approaches designed to reduce risky, irregular migration from West Africa to Europe. The first approach is to provide potential migrants with better information about the risks to be faced during the journey, including testimonials from those who have attempted the journey and statistics on the likelihood of experiencing negative events en route. The second approach is to also provide a second migration alternative, by adding information and assistance on considering migration to a neighboring country as an alternative to the risky irregular migration. The third approach is to provide an alternative path at home, by providing vocational skill training in addition to the information about the risks of irregular migration. "
