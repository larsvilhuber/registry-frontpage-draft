abstract: "Labor market signals play a crucial role in the job-matching process by reducing information frictions faced by employers. In this paper, we analyze whether the returns to these signals vary based on the accuracy of ex-ante signals. We estimate the returns to signaling by comparing locals and migrants, who differ in the accuracy of their signals. Our analysis employs data from a skill certification program in Colombia that provides both locals and migrants with credible signals within the Colombian labor market. Selection into the program was randomized, with 30 percent of spots allocated to migrants. In recent decades, Colombia has experienced a significant influx of migrants, creating substantial challenges for its labor market. Our findings contribute insights for policy improvements aimed at enhancing the labor market integration of migrants by understanding the heterogeneous returns of labor market signaling."
