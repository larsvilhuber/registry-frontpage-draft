abstract: "As the imperatives of climate change and the transition to clean energy advance, enhancing the flexibility of electricity demand becomes increasingly critical. This study aims to design an optimal residential demand response program by examining the persistent and heterogeneous effects of peak load pricing and non-price interventions, as well as their combinations, through a randomized field experiment.  We conduct our analysis within a 150,000-household experiment in China.  The intervention involves sending text messages to residents on the day before high-demand days, encouraging them to reduce their electricity consumption. "
