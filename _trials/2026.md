abstract: "While economists, policymakers, and other researchers have studied the effects of foreign aid on government processes and macroeconomic variables, few have explored the individual-level psychological effects of living in a country that is heavily dependent on foreign assistance. In this study, we randomly assigned residents of informal settlements in Kenya to one of three priming treatments in a laboratory setting. The treatments either primed the belief that Kenya is dependent on foreign aid, that Kenya is self-sufficient, or neither belief. The primes consisted of a screensavers, a short video presentation, and a writing task. After the primes, we measured their effects on honesty, effort provision, and a number of psychological variables. This document outlines the econometric methods we will use to assess the effect of the primes on these outcome variables."
