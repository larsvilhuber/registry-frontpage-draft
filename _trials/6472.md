abstract: "Diagnostic labels are commonly used in educational and medical fields. Although research has shown that diagnostic labels can have adverse consequences on individual outcomes, there remain fundamental, unresolved questions in this literature: (1) To what extent does the introduction of diagnostic labels affect outcomes for a group on average? (2) To what extent do labels improve average group outcomes at the expense of certain subgroups of individuals? (3) How do the effects of diagnostic labels for groups and individuals depend on the proportion of other individuals who are also labelled in the group? To answer these questions, we propose a large-scale cluster randomized controlled trial among approximately 5,000 first-grade schoolchildren in 195 schools in Russia. Schools were randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms, where teachers received information about the performance of their students (a) without a corresponding diagnostic label for their students’ performance or (b) with a label for students as being “basic” / “proficient” in their academic performance or “developing” / “mature” in their behavioral performance. Results will inform the functions and tradeoffs of diagnostic labels for groups and individuals."
