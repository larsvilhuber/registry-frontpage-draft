abstract: "Although the sunk cost effect is widely discussed in different research settings, the behavioral mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains elusive. In this project, I plan to conduct a lab experiment to explore subjectsâ€™ beliefs and decisions in a two-stage investment task. I aim to investigate whether subjects hold biased beliefs about the project when sunk costs are present. Furthermore, I will explore the behavioral mechanisms that potentially connect subjects' beliefs and the sunk-cost effect.
