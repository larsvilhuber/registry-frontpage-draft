abstract: "While the bulk of existing research on stereotype threat predominantly examines its effects on individual performance, limited attention has been given to understanding its potential influence on group dynamics and collaborative efforts. To address this gap, this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is designed to explore the impact of a stereotype threat intervention within the context of an Economics class, with a specific focus on enhancing the performance of female students, their confidence and sense of belonging. The intervention aims to counteract stereotype threat by providing an information-based intervention that emphasizes a prevailing belief: the majority of individuals believe that female-identifying students perform at the same level as others in Economics.

The study employs a two-layer randomization strategy. In the initial layer, participants are subjected to random assignment, placing them either in the intervention group, which receives a randomized information treatment at the end of the baseline survey, or in the control group. Subsequently, in the second layer, participants are organized into small teams, typically comprising 3-4 members, to facilitate collaborative group work activities. Consequently, these groups will exhibit varying proportions of individuals who have undergone the treatment. The dual randomization process allows us to evaluate the causal impact of the intervention, both at the individual level and within the context of group performance."
