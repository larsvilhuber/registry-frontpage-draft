abstract: "Choice Architects design choice environments. In this setting, Choice Architects may use nudges, changes to the environment, that predictably affect behaviour but keep payoffs constant and do not restrain options available. This project investigates how transparency, awareness of the Choice Architects' use of nudges, changes how nudges influence behaviour and how Choice Architects use them. The model distinguishes between System 1 nudges that rely on mental shortcuts (for example, default options) and System 2 nudges that engage reflective thinking (for example, by providing a new way to think about the choice). The model predicts that a) System 1 nudges have less effect under transparency while System 2 nudges have the same effectiveness and 2) the use of System 1 nudges is reduced by transparency while the use of System 2 nudges is increased."
