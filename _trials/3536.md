abstract: "In many developing countries educational access has increased since 2000, yet learning levels remain disturbingly low. This study used an RCT in Pakistan to test a novel middle school intervention that briefly trained teachers on pedagogical techniques and provided classrooms with video content to enhance middle school students' achievement in grade level mathematics and science. We test students using an exam designed specifically for the study. We also test the impact of the program on scores in a provincial standardized test, which all students take for admission into public high schools. We measure and test the programs impact on student and teacher attendance, and other measures of student and teacher effort.  "
