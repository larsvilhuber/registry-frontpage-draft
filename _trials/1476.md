abstract: "Child Collegio Carlo Alberto in cooperation with Ufficio Pio will pilot a conditional cash transfer programme that will focus on providing  information set of families with children. We will evaluate the effects of conditional cash transfer methods on the well-being of families with at least one child aged 0-6 years. 

We are using a different type of condition to those used in the international experiences: the transfer is not dependent on how it is used or its effects, but on exposure to information and guidance that could encourage choices potentially tackling poverty and fostering the families' well-being.

The design of the evaluation is such that there will be one control group not receiving any transfer, a first treatment group of families receiving an unconditional cash transfer, and a second treatment group receiving the conditional cash transfer. The condition is based on attendance to a set of courses aimed at improving individual labor market opportunities, household financial conditions, human capital accumulation of family members, children well-being, health status of family members, etc.

The aim of the study is to compare the potential effects of conditional cash transfers (based on the participation in educational/training activities) vs. unconditional cash transfers on a set of outcomes such as labor market outcomes of family members, participation in activities fostering family members' human capital accumulation, family economic and financial situation, use of money, children well-being and development, health related outcomes such as health status and food consumption, etc. "
