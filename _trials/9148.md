abstract: "In many contexts, policymakers have a set of different policy instruments at their disposal. Among the most prominent ones are regulatory and economic measures. In this study, we investigate whether basic moral beliefs, inequality aversion and efficiency preferences are important determinants of the acceptance of such measures. We also examine the effects of a number of information treatments regarding the consequences of policies in terms of inequality and effectiveness as well as the available policy sets on policy preferences."
