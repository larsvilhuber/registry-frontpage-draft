abstract: "Across the world, political parties have regional strongholds where competition in the general election is weak and the competition of import occurs at the primary stage. Internal party selection processes thus directly determine the characteristics and performance of elected representatives in many areas. In much of the developing world, these processes are opaque, controlled by elites, and likely hampered by information constraints. Working with the Political Parties Registration Commission in Sierra Leone, we propose to evaluate whether increasing citizen voice in primaries and hosting party primary conventions that feature informative debates between aspirants facilitate the election of more competent and accountable leaders.
