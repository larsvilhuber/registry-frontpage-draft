abstract: "We study a program of informal, peer performance evaluation among classroom teachers who work in the same school. Maths and English teachers who teach these subjects in years 10 and 11 in “treatment” schools, all of which are secondary schools in areas of high deprivation in England, are asked to implement a program of peer observation for a period of two school years. The experiment is designed to estimate the effect of peer observation on teacher performance in the classroom, as measured by teachers’ contributions to student achievement and attainment, and by teachers’ observed teaching practices. The experiment is also designed to estimate different effects for teachers who are the “observer” and teachers who are the “observee”, and the influence of the frequency of observations. Observer teachers conduct an observation of their peer observee teacher and provide an evaluation; observers assign scores on specific skills using a structured rubric. However, the program is not a formal evaluation; there are no formal incentives or stakes attached to the scores."
