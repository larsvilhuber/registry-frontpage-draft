abstract: "Humanitarian responses in Somalia are increasingly focusing on building household resilience to shocks. A gradual shift towards supporting microenterprises, through capital grants and business training, from unconditional cash transfers manifest resilience this resilience building efforts. However, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of microenterprise development interventions. Therefore, various decisions on operationalizing such programs, such as the size of capital grant or the type of non-financial supports to be added, are rarely based on rigorous evidence. In this study, we randomly assign households to receive three different amounts of one-off business grant and compare them a control group who receive an unconditional transfer of monthly stipend. The interventions were rolled out in early 2017 followed by a short-term impact assessment 3-months after the end of transfers. This study will measure the effects of the grant size variations 3-years later. In addition to the grant size, the study will look into the role of clan relationship which is often identified as an important factor determining the success  of development interventions in Somalia. For this aspect of this study, we intended to exploit the non-experimental variations in the clan identity and inter-clan relationships of the beneficiaries to see how the impact varies by this characteristic.
