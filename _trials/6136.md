abstract: "Lock-in effects arise when individuals are dependent on a particular product or service and cannot switch to another product or service without incurring significant switching costs. In this paper, we theoretically and experimentally study switching behavior of digital workers, which results from the exploitation of locked-in digital workers by the respective labor market platform. We investigate the extent and frequency of the exploitation as second-order effects. Lock-in effects frequently result from the absence of reputation portability, thereby generating high switching costs for platform users. We therefore analyze whether reputation portability increases switching behavior in an online labor market context. Our experimental design explains switching based on (1) monetary motives and (2) other-regarding behavior, i.e., we examine whether digital workers base their decisions on the economic outcome of their earnings, or whether they react to what they believe to be the intentions of the platform."
