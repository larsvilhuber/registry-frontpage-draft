abstract: "This study evaluates the impact of a literacy program for first-grade students. Thirty-two public schools from a state capital in Brazil participate in the evaluation. Half of them was randomly assigned to the treatment group. Schools in the control group kept their standard routines. The program aims to teach students to how to read and write by combining direct instruction with the phonics method. The program provides training for teachers and pedagogical coordinators as well as the teaching materials for method implementation. "
