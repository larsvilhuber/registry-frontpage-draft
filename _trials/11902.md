abstract: "Recent studies indicate that only one out of three female students persists in their chosen field when it is historically dominated by males, whereas male students persist at a rate of 70%. This research project uses an experimental approach to study the effects of incorporating female role models (role-model) in delivering information on educational and occupational alternatives related to Industrial Maintenance and Automation 4.0 among female students in vocational-technical high schools in Chile (EMTP by its acronym in Spanish) in the context of a middle-income country.  The experiment involves a short-term intervention where male and female students from Electrical, Electronics, Industrial Mechanics, Automotive Mechanics, and Programming specializations in 80 EMTP institutions are introduced to the labor context, qualifications, and occupational profiles of the multisector of Industrial Maintenance and Automation 4.0. Furthermore, the students receive guidance on the associated educational and occupational pathways. In the “treatment” institutions, the information and guidance will include life stories of three female professionals who have built their educational and occupational careers from EMTP to the Industrial Maintenance and Automation 4.0 multisector. In the remaining “control" institutions, neutral gender-oriented information and guidance will be provided. We will study the effects of the exposure to role-models through video on educational aspirations and mechanisms such as gender stereotypes on women in EMTP careers."
