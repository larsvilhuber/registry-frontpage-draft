abstract: "Prior research, conducted predominantly in low-income countries, has found that unconditional cash transfers can be an effective means of lifting people out of poverty. We propose that financial capital alone may be insufficient to fully address the challenges posed by poverty, which include a lack of belongingness, information, and goal-setting accountabilityâ€”challenges that may be more adequately addressed through social capital. We hypothesize that the effects of financial and social capital are additive or potentially even multiplicative, such that each form of capital adds to or even enhances the effectiveness of the other. In collaboration with a US-based non-profit organization, we will test these predictions in an 18-month randomized controlled trial. We will randomize approximately 1,800 low-income households in Cambridge and Boston, MA, into one of four treatment arms: financial capital (unconditional cash transfers of $500 per month for 18 months), social capital (encouragement to develop and strengthen social ties), the combination of both the financial and social capital treatments, or no treatment. Using in-depth panel data composed of surveys, administrative bank account data, and administrative welfare receipt data, we not only seek to understand whether the combination of financial and social capital can improve financial, psychological, health, and family well-being outcomes, but also why and for whom they may improve outcomes. Taken together, these data will offer insights into how the combination of financial and social capital can support low-income US households in sustainably moving out of poverty."
