abstract: "Ethiopia’s rates of immunization remain low, as only 24% of Ethiopian children aged 12-13 months are fully immunized (EDHA 2012). This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to improve immunization completion rates for children in the Oromia region in Ethiopia.  We will accomplish this through a two-pronged behaviorally informed intervention that studies (1) how to engage communities by using behaviorally-informed feedback to mobilize health care workers around improving immunization rates, and (2) how to create a positive reinforcement loop for those improvements using non-monetary rewards. 

The intervention works with health extension workers (HEWs) using two parts that work in tandem: (1) giving HEWs the ability to easily track dropouts and a system for making follow-up of drop-outs easy while providing recognition and (2) social proof to both the HEW and caregivers. Utilizing a planning prompt to create a moment of action, the “HEW Outreach movement” prompts HEWs to think about outreach for immunization at the right time and to perform targeted outreach to dropouts. Utilizing social proof and a salient tracking system, the “Stamp System” component makes it simple for HEWs to track dropouts and for mothers to take additional ownership of and track their child’s progress and see that it is both normal and desirable to immunize their children.  

We used random assignment to assign communities to control and treatment groups.  The control group will receive the standard Ethiopian Ministry of Health immunization schedule while the treatment group will receive a behaviorally-informed feedback and non-monetary rewards intervention. Randomization will occur at the level of a Health Post (HP), the lowest health service delivery unit in Ethiopia with a catchment area roughly equivalent to a village.  The intervention was implemented from December 2016 through June 2018 in Arsi and East Shewa zones of the Oromia region of Ethiopia. For the evaluation, 90 Health Posts (HPs)—45 in the treatment group and 45 in the control group—were selected and a random sample of 30 households from each HP catchment cluster were included for the household survey.  Child-level immunization status data will be obtained from baseline and endline household surveys to assess the impact of the intervention using multivariate regression analysis to quantitatively assess the impact of the supportive feedback and non-monetary rewards.
