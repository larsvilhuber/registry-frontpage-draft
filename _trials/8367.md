abstract: "We design the experiment to test whether and to what extent information about the electric utilities can change public support for various electricity pricing schemes that are designed and implemented by the organization via public trust in the organization. We use a 2 (competence-based information vs. no information) by 2 (integrity-based information vs. no information) between-subjects factorial design. Participants are randomly allocated to one of the four experimental conditions, each having a sample size of 1,125. Competence-based information is a statement about organizational experience and expertise in electric utility business, while integrity-based information is a statement about organizational honesty, openness, and concern for public interest. After receiving information, respondents read a brief description about four different types of electricity pricing schemes. Then, respondents are given a 5-point Likert-scale to gauge their support for each scheme, from strongly support to strongly oppose.
