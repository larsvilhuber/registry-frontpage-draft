abstract: "Powerful state administrators can take advantage of their positions to extract resources,
especially when political accountability is broken. We conjecture that administrators’ power depends
on their ability to inflict harm using the power of office, their ability to mobilize powerful
networks, and on their privileged access to information. Measuring transfers to administrators
is challenging, because they often involve secrecy, and surveys often draw on recall. To circumvent
this challenge, we develop a smart phone application, and monitor 400 households of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo to privately report every day the universe of payments made
during 5 months. The DRC offers a well-suited environment, because administrators systematically
use their power to extract payments from citizens at unusually high rates. We deploy
three randomized interventions aimed to affect the balance of power between administrators
and households. First, since administrators systematically take advantage of a tax code that
is extremely confusing, we organize pro-bono weekly tax consulting to a group of households.
Second, to affect the bargaining power that stems from unequal access to social networks, we
extend a link from a reputed civil society organization to randomly selected citizens. The organization
uses its political leverage to protect the selected citizens. Third, we organize a city-wide
campaign to expose administrators known to have committed abuses in a random sample of
neighborhoods."
