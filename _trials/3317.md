abstract: "The growing literature on human capital accumulation has emphasized the importance of socio-emotional skills in explaining individual differences in achievement in various economic and social domains. These skills encompass a broad range of individual character traits, often measured via standardized questionnaires by psychologists and, more recently, via incentivized experimental elicitation techniques by economists. Non-cognitive skills such as patience, self-control and conscientiousness, and preference parameters such as risk attitudes have been shown to be highly predictive of outcomes ranging from educational attainment, occupational and financial success to criminal activity and health outcomes. 

In collaboration with the Turkish Ministry of Education, we evaluate a randomized educational program that aims to foster grit. The program involves an intensive teacher training program, supported by a specifically designed curriculum. The curriculum consists of animated videos, mini case studies and classroom activities that highlight i) the plasticity of the human brain against the notion of innately fixed ability, ii) the role of effort in enhancing skills and achieving goals, iii) the importance of a constructive interpretation of failures and therefore perseverance, and iv) the importance of goal setting. 

The intervention is randomized across 37 schools in socioeconomically disadvantaged district of Istanbul. We measure the outcomes through a multi-faceted methodology that includes a novel incentivized real effort task, grades and objective test scores. The incentivized real effort task is designed to elicit a number of aspects of grit: challenge seeking, perseverance through setbacks, goal setting and the propensity to engage in effortful behavior to accumulate skill. In addition to experimental choices and outcomes, we administer standardized tests to measure mathematics and verbal (Turkish) skills. 

We find that treated students are more likely to exert effort to accumulate task-specific ability, and hence, more likely to succeed. In a follow up 2.5 years after the intervention, we estimate an effect of about 0.2 standard deviations on a standardized math test.
