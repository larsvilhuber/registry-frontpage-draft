abstract: "In this study, we plan to better understand the role of peers and experience in shaping the demand for cultural activities, in our case museum visits and museum membership purchases. Museum membership cards ("Abbonamento Musei Piemonte") in the Italian region of Piedmont allow members to visit partnering museumsâ€™ for one year without limits. 

We plan to have three distinct treatments. In the first, we induce an additional peer through a referral program, where a referring museum member (M) receives a discount for a new membership card that he/she can share with a friend (F). In the second, we induce an extra visit rewarding M with a small gadget that he/she can pick up after visiting a specific museum. The third group of treated Ms receives a discount and the gadget, identifying complementarities in cultural consumption between experience and peers."
