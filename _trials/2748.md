abstract: "While many organizations use corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs to encourage increased worker performance, less is known about CSR's impact on other organizational outcomes that may be of interest to managers. This study provides an initial examination the intra-organizational benefits of CSR on coordination outcomes in work groups. I investigate this question by randomizing participants into CSR or own pay conditions and having them play a coordination game in groups of three in which each individual's payoff is based on the minimum effort chosen by individuals in the group. Prior research has argued that high coordination levels can act as a socially-complex "expectational asset" that cannot be easily imitated or replicated by competitors (Knez and Camerer 1994). Developing strong coordination norms, therefore, could be a key aspect of creating sustainable competitive advantage. "
