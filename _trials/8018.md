abstract: "One reason for poor integration outcomes of immigrants can be a lack of information about local
integration support programs, language courses, job offers and other relevant local information.
This project evaluates the effectiveness of providing
local information for immigrants to improve their economic and social integration outcomes. The
information is provided by the app Integreat, developed by our partner NGO Tür an Tür -
Digitalfabrik in collaboration with German municipalities. Our project will randomly select
immigrants who have recently arrived in Germany and introduce them to the Integreat app. We
will evaluate if and how much they use the app, and whether it improves their integration
outcomes, as measured in administrative data and complementary surveys."
