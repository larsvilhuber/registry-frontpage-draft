abstract: "Exposure to climate change related weather shocks is often considered an important driver of internal and international migration. We evaluate whether alternative strategies to adapt to these shocks mitigate migration intentions of individuals through a discrete choice experiment. Individuals are presented with a hypothetical prolonged drought situation and afterwards with a randomly assigned adaptation solution. By assessing responses before and after the assignment of the adaptation strategies, we will measure the impact of climate change adaptation on migration intentions and comparison across individuals will inform about the relative effectiveness of each strategy."
