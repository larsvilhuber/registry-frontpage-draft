abstract: "In this work, we are assessing the impact of messaging with or without a $50 financial incentive on influenza vaccination rates in a county health system. Our main hypothesis is that a message with a $50 financial incentive will increase vaccination rates relative to a control/"treatment as usual" group.  We further hypothesize that the financial incentive will increase vaccination rates relative to the message only arm.
