abstract: "In this study, we wanted to find out the effect of the Mediterranean diet and beetroot juice on patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver.

The administration of the juice is standard, with only 500 ml daily given to each patient in the morning on an empty stomach for 12 weeks.

We first diagnose patients with sonography to determine their liver fat levels and re-evaluate the patients after 12 weeks of taking the juice.
