abstract: "Perceptions of discrimination and of one's own identity can affect how jobseekers behave. We outline a 3-stage labor market experiment in a Brazilian slum (where home address is a stigma, a mark used to discriminate) to understand how jobseekers behave in the labor market in response to changes the salience of their stigma."
