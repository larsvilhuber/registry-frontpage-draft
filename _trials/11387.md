abstract: "We study behavior in finitely repeated prisoner's dilemma experiments, where fixed pairs of players will interact for 100 rounds. The research question is how payoff parameters affect cooperation. Specifically, we vary the efficiency of cooperation and the temptation to defect in an orthogonal 2x2 design.  The null hypothesis is that cooperation does not differ between treatments. The alternative hypothesis is that cooperation should be higher and more stable in "easy" games, where efficiency is high and temptation to defect is low, than in "hard" games, where efficiency is low and temptation is high. We expect cooperation in the other two treatments (high efficiency, high temptation; and low efficiency, low temptation) to be between the hard and easy games. We plan to recruit 40 pairs for each treatment, that is, a total of 320 volunteer participants registered with the CeDEx lab at the University of Nottingham. The experiment will be computerized with the experimental software zTree and conducted in the CeDEx lab. "
