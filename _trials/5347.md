abstract: "We collaborate with a retail company and investigate changes in the salesworkers' compensation system. In an RCT, we study the effect of assigning higher weights to high-margin products in the determination of workers' compensation. We compare two compensation systems. The first system is solely based on workers' individual performance (i.e., their revenue). In the second system, revenues of high-margin products are assigned higher weights than revenues of low-margin products, and the commission is based on weighted revenue. We study how the different compensation systems affect revenues from the different types of products, turnover, conversion rates (i.e., the rate at which customers being served by salesworkers buy the firm's products), and granted discounts."
