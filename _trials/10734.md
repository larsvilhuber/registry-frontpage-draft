abstract: "Collegio Carlo Alberto, in cooperation with local service providers, will evaluate a program assigning case workers to support study mothers in their participation to the labour market. Case workers will guide mothers in their labour supply choices, providing information on the availability of dedicated services aimed at work-family reconciliation and the provision of education for their children. This study will focus on mothers who volunteer to enrol in the program. We will randomize women into a treated and a control group. The treated group will be asked to meet with case workers who will guide them on their labour supply choices and promote work-family reconciliation and education services. Women in the control group will have access to some support services but will not be guided by case workers. This study will compare of effect of the support of case workers, and usage of support services, on a set of outcomes such as labour market decisions of women, participation in activities, family members' human capital accumulation, mother well-being, use of time and children development."
