abstract: "Language acquisition is key to success in school as it impacts future acquisitions like writting skills, vocabulary size and quality as well as cognitive and non-cognitive dimensions. It is admitted that early childhood (up to five years old) is the most important period for the development of a child. This development is impacted by various factors like the socio-economic environment a child grows in : accordingly, first inequalities are transmitted to children especially through language acquisition. As an example, Hart and Risley (1995) show that, at the age of three, a child from a blue-collar family heard on average thirty million words less than a child from a white-collar family, creating important inequalities that school has difficulties to reduce as surveys like PISA can show in France. Investing in language development programs in preschools is proven to have large positive effects on several short and long terms outcomes (Carolina Abecedarian, Perry Preschool Project) as well as being cost-effective. Parler Bambin is a french program that focuses on language development in nurseries for child from zero to three years old. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of Parler Bambin on children and families outcomes as well as on the behaviors of the nurseries' workers."
