abstract: "This study consists of two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) designed to improve our understanding of the interaction between a health crisis and political behavior. Both are conducted as part of a nationally representative telephone survey of 2000 adult residents of Ukraine in mid-April 2000, early in the COVID-19 outbreak. The first RCT investigates three mechanisms through which a pandemic might impact the authority of political leaders (here measured as job approval). The second RCT investigates whether leadersâ€™ political authority matters in being able to influence health-related behavior (different forms of social distancing) that might impact the spread of the virus. We are particularly interested in whether any of these effects are moderated by the ethnic identity of the respondent."
