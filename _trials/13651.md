abstract: "In response to the emergence of online platforms that match workers with specific tasks such as ride-sharing, coding, or handy work, lawmakers, regulators, and sometimes even voters created new rules to govern these novel forms of work. The regulations often seek to strike a balance between the benefits of gig work, primarily flexibility and autonomy, and the advantages of traditional forms of employment.  In this paper, we study the welfare effects of a wide range of hypothetical job designs, using ride-sharing as our example. We ask three questions: First, if current and prospective drivers were to choose freely between different job designs, which features would be particularly attractive to them? Second, what are the design elements of jobs that find broad political appeal among voters? And third, what are the welfare consequences of imposing politically popular job designs on current and prospective drivers? To answer these questions, we use conjoint survey experiments to solicit preferences for job designs from both likely voters and prospective drivers. In our analysis, we first estimate voters’ and drivers' preferences for each job attribute. Equipped with these estimates, we then predict the expected voter support for all possible job designs. Zooming in on designs that secure a majority of votes, we estimate drivers’ decisions to drive as well as their well-being under these working conditions.  Our project aims to expand the horizon on what ridesharing could look like and the welfare consequences of having voters and their representatives decide labor market regulations."
