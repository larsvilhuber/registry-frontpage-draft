abstract: "In a bid to improve menstrual health outcomes in LMICs, state policies and civic society have determinedly promoted the take up of disposable pads, at the neglect of less polluting sustainable and cheaper alternatives. This oversight is problematic as it contributes to the increased burden of waste management, and denies women the right to informed choice. Using an experimental approach, this study seeks to examine the effects of exposure to sustainable alternatives compared with disposable pads on women’s attitudes to menstrual materials and practices. We test the hypothesis that such exposure positively effects women’s preferences and attitudes to more sustainable alternatives versus disposable pads.

The study will be conducted across 10 sites in the city of Hyderabad, Telangana with the help of 2 facilitating grass-roots NGOs (Safa and KGNMT). We will use a community participation methodology that carefully considers the cultural context and policy backdrop in which decisions on menstrual products and practices are made. 

The basic design is to recruit 500 women (50 from each site) and randomly allocate them to one of the three conditions using the ration 1:2:2: information only (C1); information + reusable material (C2); information + disposable pad (C3). After baseline survey, we will provide each of the three conditions with information on menstrual hygiene and alternative materials. Those in C2 and C3 will be provided with relevant menstrual material sufficient for 6 months of use. End line will be carried out after 6 months. At both baseline and end line we will collect information on various menstrual outcomes including knowledge; preferred material; menstrual practices (access, use and disposal). Primary outcome will be preference, with secondary outcomes being knowledge and attitudes to use and disposal.  "
