abstract: "The overarching goal of this project is to bring the discussion on inefficiencies in residential energy use from theory to practical application using innovative technical methods (such as designing and developing a mobile application for our experiment purposes) and insights from behavioral economics. In the project, we will investigate inefficiencies in household energy use due to various behavioral issues, focusing on lack of relevant information about energy use. We will implement field experiments, which will help us answer the question of how provision of various information (for example, notifications about peak electricity prices or social comparisons) affect energy use among households."
