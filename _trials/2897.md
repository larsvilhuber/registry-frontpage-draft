abstract: "We assess the impact of the different components of an integrated cash transfer safety net combined with home visits reinforcing health-nutrition practices and psycho-social child development on a broad range of ECD outcomes including anthropometrics, nutritional status, cognitive ability, and socio-emotional development of children ages 0 to 5 years old as well as on poverty indicators (such as household food and non-food consumption, accumulation of productive assets, and use of health services)."
