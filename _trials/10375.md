abstract: "Previous experimental findings suggest that positive emotions promote productivity in a numeric task. While in the real world, the gender stereotype effect has been found to decrease team performance to some extent. Based on prior works, we ask whether induced emotions affect the participant's willingness to answer for the group in different gender types. We are especially interested in two induced emotions, fear, and pleasure.  "
