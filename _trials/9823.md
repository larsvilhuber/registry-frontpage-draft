abstract: "The use of telemedicine has been on the rise over the last decade, fueled even more by the need for remote services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine has the potential to increase access and lower costs of healthcare. But there are concerns that these benefits could come at the expense of quality. Despite the rise in its use, there is little empirical evidence on the impact of telemedicine on quality of care, utilization, or costs. In this study, we evaluate the impact of Babyl, a digital health services platform in Rwanda, compared to conventional health care facilities through several complementary approaches including qualitative surveys, use of standardized patients to evaluate quality of care, analysis of observational data, and a randomized control trial to encourage take-up and use of Babyl digital services.
