abstract: "Economic growth depends critically on managerial decisions that concern innovation, a context characterized by high uncertainty. Unfortunately, research shows that managers or entrepreneurs do not have good routines or methods to make decisions under uncertainty. This suggests that there might be serious benefits from improving the efficiency of public and private investments to nurture entrepreneurship. The goal of this project is to understand the implications of an approach that teaches managers to start their decision making process with a good framing of the problem, developing models that predict the outcomes of actions from logical
connections between antecedents and consequences, testing the model using existing data or data drawn from well-defined experimental designs and that assess the results in a disciplined way. We call this approach scientific because it overlaps to a significant
extent with the approach that scientists use to develop new knowledge. To this aim, the project designs and implements a large-scale randomized control trial (RCT) conducted in six countries (Italy, UK, Spain, Colombia, the Netherlands, India) based on an intervention that comprises six/eight training sessions over about three months offered to randomly generated groups of entrepreneurs."
