abstract: "We are interested in documenting gender gaps in Ethiopia by observing the administrative sector at a large University and decomposing factors that may contribute to the wage (and position) gap using institutional data. We propose to rigorously explore two potential explanations for the gender gap: 1) whether the evaluation of potential job candidates are a function of the candidate's gender, and 2) whether following advice is a function of the gender of the advisor.
