abstract: "Managing expectations via central bank communication has become a primary component of monetary policy. A necessary condition for effective communication is central bank credibility. Despite this, we know surprisingly little about the determinants and properties of credibility. This paper aims to fill this gap by introducing a novel experimental framework that allows for nuanced study of central bank credibility. We employ this framework to study how variations in a central bank’s recent inflation forecasting performance influences subjects’ perceptions of the bank’s credibility."
