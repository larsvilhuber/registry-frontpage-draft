abstract: "The proposed study investigates the underlying mechanism for reciprocal behavior in strategic interactions. Previous experiments have found evidence on reciprocity and many theoretical models have been proposed to capture reciprocity in economics, some of which argue that reciprocity depends on intentions, while others argue that it depends on outcomes. However, how exactly reciprocity depends on intentions and outcomes has not been carefully examined because no previous experiments can clearly tease out the two. This paper attempts to experimentally quantify the importance of intentions and outcomes for determining reciprocal behavior and provides guidance for future modelling. "
