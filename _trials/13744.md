abstract: "This study seeks to identify government interventions that can improve the efficiency of public health insurance schemes without reducing their effectiveness. We conduct a statewide RCT that randomizes an intervention to increase the threat of crackdown on hospital fraud across private hospitals in one state of India. We leverage administrative data from the insurance program and augment it with patient surveys to measure impacts on hospital fraud, as well as patient out-of-pocket charges, care access, and care quality. The study will provide some of the first evidence on hospital fraud and monitoring within insurance in LMICs. It will also provide insights on the design and effectiveness of monitoring (auditing) systems given limited state resources that generalize to social insurance and assistance programs more broadly."
