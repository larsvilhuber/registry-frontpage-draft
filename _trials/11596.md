abstract: "This study investigates the impact of informational nudges on villagers' participation decisions in China's Rural Toilet Revolution (RTR). A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a southwestern region of China,  where six RTR advocacy videos were designed as informational nudges based on local residents' information demand for RTR programs. The videos respectively highlight the benefits of RTR participation, the harms of poor sanitation, and techniques for toilet upgrades, with and without a former RTR participant calling for engagement. This study finds that explaining the required techniques of RTR participation was the most effective in motivating local villagers' willingness to engage in RTR while making the health benefits of RTR participation salient is the most significant factor in incentivizing their uptake of RTR programs in the long run. The results indicate the importance of technical attributes and benefits associated with RTR for the target audience and underline information barrier removal and peer messenger presence as useful nudges to promote public campaigns like RTR."
