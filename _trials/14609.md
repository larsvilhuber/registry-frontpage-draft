abstract: "Consistent with Executive Orders 13985 and 14035, there is a government-wide initiative to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) in the Federal workforce by offering training and educational content. The President’s Management Agenda (PMA) similarly includes the strengthening and empowering of the Federal workforce as one of its three pillars. The PMA’s Learning Agenda specifically asks what types of trainings and tools for Federal employees can improve equity outcomes Prior academic research on the effectiveness of DEIA trainings does not provide a clear picture as to whether they can induce changes in employee behavior to achieve desired DEIA outcomes.
This project will use a clustered randomized control trial (C-RCT) to evaluate the impact of a rigorous Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) training program for Federal employees on long-term behavioral outcomes, namely the utilization of sick days and work unit attrition.
The intervention is based on a robust DEIA training curriculum developed by a Federal agency for their workforce. The training program consists of a series of 11 virtual modules (plus one module designed to be delivered only to managers and supervisors). Sessions are designed to be highly interactive and take advantage of various virtual platform engagement tools. Each module takes roughly 90 minutes of time to complete and are delivered roughly every other week."
