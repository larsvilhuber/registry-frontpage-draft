abstract: "Using a randomized evaluation with 432 Mexican small and medium enterprises, we show that access to
management consulting had positive effects on total factor productivity and return-on-assets (about 0.2
standard deviations, relative to the control group). Owners also had significant increase in
“entrepreneurial spirit” (an index that measures entrepreneurial confidence and goal setting). Using
Mexican social security data, we find a persistent large increase (about 50%) in the number of
employees and total wage bill even five years after the program. We document large heterogeneity in
the specific managerial practices that improved as a result of the consulting, but the three most
prominent areas are marketing, financial accounting, and long-term business planning."
