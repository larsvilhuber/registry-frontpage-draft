abstract: "Using a randomized control trial, we will assess the hypothesis that exposing individuals to relevant information about the importance of their local mangroves and providing them with sports equipment to incentivize their participation in these training leads to measurable changes in environmental awareness, behaviors, and attitudes while promoting good health, teamwork, and leadership through sports. Additionally, we will measure spillovers to their family members and kids outside of the treatment group in the treated communities."
