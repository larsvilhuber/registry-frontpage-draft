abstract: "VAT tax evasion erodes government budgets available for public goods, is a source of unfair competition, and exposes individuals to exploitative work conditions. The prevalence of VAT evasion and its determinants are difficult to study, because of its illegal nature. Our objective in this study is to identify the share of firms in Germany that have ever evaded VAT tax. We implement the randomized response technique in a sample of firm decision makers active in Germany. Additional information on the position in the value chain and the firm's industry allows us to compare the occurrence of VAT evasion across parts of the firm population that differ in their firm characteristics and scope of activity. We supplement the results on the prevalence of tax evasion with estimates of its quantitative importance using the indirect questioning technique. The results will provide important insights into the mechanics of tax evasion and valuable starting points for a refined discussion of policy measures to combat this phenomenon."
