abstract: "M-CARES will provide novel experimental evidence on the effects of financial access to contraception in the U.S. on contraceptive efficacy, pregnancy, and childbearing for U.S. women. It also generates experimental evidence of the effects of financial access to contraception on a wide range of less commonly studied outcomes, including physical health and health care use; educational attainment and labor-market outcomes; financial security; relationship quality; mental health and well-being; and receipt of public benefits. M-CARES will recruit 5,000 women ages 18 to 35 years old at Planned Parenthood of Michigan (PPMI) clinics. Half of the study participants will be randomized to receive a voucher to purchase contraceptives of their choice at PPMI within 100 days of study enrollment."
