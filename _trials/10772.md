abstract: "In an online experiment, we randomly expose subjects to an information treatment on unauthorized immigration to the US. We study how this information treatment affects perceived similarity to unauthorized immigrants and views on unauthorized immigration.

To facilitate comparison of the effects to those in a field experiment containing an identical information treatment (AEARCTR-0009194), we will also reweight the online sample to match demographics in the field (incl. age, gender, share Hispanic, share liberal), or alternatively, to match national averages."
