abstract: "This project will evaluate the long-term effects of an exercise intervention among university students. The exercise intervention consisted of a free gym membership in the academic spring semester of 2016 (January – June), and was provided as part of a randomized-controlled trial, where a total of 778 university students in Bergen, Norway, participated: 398 students received the free gym card and were thus treated, whereas the remaining students did not receive free access to attend the student gym and thus constitute the control group. The immediate effects of the intervention – i.e., the effects in the spring semester 2016 – are documented in the published article “Exercise Improves Academic Performance” (forthcoming in the Journal of Political Economy), which in turn built on the pre-analysis plan AEARCTR-0001949. In the current project we will investigate the long-term effects of the intervention – i.e., the effects after the free gym card expired in June 2016 – addressing three distinct research questions.  

First, speaking to literature on habit formation we want to understand whether the exercise intervention enabled the formation of an exercise habit in subsequent semesters (focusing on the fall 2016). More specifically, we will analyze whether treated students are more likely to buy a gym card at a cost (capturing people's exercise intentions) as well as actual gym attendance using administrative scanner data.    

Second, speaking to the literature on the dynamics of academic achievements, we will analyze whether the boost in completed study points observed in the spring 2016 (caused by the exercise intervention) promotes sustained academic success or whether it crowds out academic performance in subsequent semesters (focusing on the fall 2016). Importantly, the long-term effects on academic performance may be completely independent of whether exercise is habitual or not.

Third, using comprehensive data from an endline survey conducted two years after the intervention (spring 2018, 92% response rate) we will adress the effects of the exercise intervention on a broader set of life outcomes (outside the sphere of exercise and academic performance), including a health index, BMI, life satisfaction, a self-control index, and occupational status.

We will consider whether to write three separate papers based on this project or bundle the findings into one paper, but for complete overview we specify all the analysis in one single pre-plan."
