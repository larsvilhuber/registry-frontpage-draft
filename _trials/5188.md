abstract: "Immigration can contribute to the sustainable development of ageing host countries. The challenge for this policy to succeed is the integration of immigrants. This project proposes to experimentally evaluate the impact of policies to enhance immigrant integration using a randomized controlled trial to be implemented among 1500 Cape Verdean immigrants residing in Portugal. The interventions will be multi-dimensional and are expected to promote better quality employment of migrants, better access and usage of health or education services, and to improve integration indicators."
