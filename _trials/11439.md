abstract: "This study will administer a survey to the full population of current California high school seniors who have initiated a financial aid application in Spring 2023 and ask about their experiences in high school and plans for college attendance in Summer and Fall 2023. This study will draw on responses from a survey instrument developed by researchers at UC Davis, with input and consultation from California Student Aid Commission (CSAC) officials. The survey focuses on three domains: 1) studentsâ€™ plans for college enrollment; 2) supports students received in applying for financial aid; and 3) their perceptions about their high school performance and experiences. As described below, within the survey, we include two information nudges.  One nudge provides information on the potential benefits of attending summer school at a California Community College.  The second nudge provides information on the potential financial aid benefits of enrolling full-time at a California Community College.  Both information nudges are administered randomly to the survey respondents to see if the information provided influences student college enrollment and subsequent outcomes.
