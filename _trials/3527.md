abstract: "We investigate the role of technology in addressing challenges faced by small firms in recruiting low-skilled workers in Bangalore, India. Firms in our setting report a desire to expand their operations but face difficulties in finding credible candidates outside their personal networks. Online recruitment platforms provide an opportunity for such firms to expand their recruitment pools; yet, the information available on candidates recruited via online platforms may not be of the same quality as those recruited from personal networks. This lack of credible information may limit external hiring, lead to high rates of employee turnover, and limit job opportunities for candidates outside of employer networks. In partnership with QuikrJobs, a leading online job portal for low- and semi-skilled recruitment in India, we investigate whether and how these ‘hiring frictions’ restrict firm growth and performance. First, we expand the pool of applicants available to firms recruiting on the platform by giving them access to premium recruitment services. Second, we introduce applicant background verifications for employers, intended to mimic the screening function of personal networks, and vary employer access to this information. Combining administrative data and detailed firm and jobseeker surveys, we then assess the impact of these interventions over a 12-month period on a range of firm- and worker-level outcomes. "
