abstract: "This project proposes a measure of complexity for mechanisms that is based on their algorithmic descriptions. We formulate the “mental” model followed by participants who are given an algorithmic description of a mechanism as an extensive game-form that reflects the steps of the algorithmic description. Players’ strategies in this extensive-form game reflect the information used from their (direct) strategies in the resulting mechanism in each step. In this framework, the standard direct mechanism can be interpreted as eliciting a strategy for said extensive game-form. We define a family of sequential mechanisms for a given algorithmic description as the set of nodes in which the continuation strategies are elicited. A mechanism A is deemed as less complex than B if during A’s execution, its strategies elicit the actions from a subset of the nodes of B. We test this theory in a controlled laboratory experiment, by studying whether subjects ability to best respond in direct and sequential versions of the Gale-Shapley DA and Boston mechanisms will improve when these are less complex with respect to our measure."
