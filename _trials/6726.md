abstract: "The majority of research on group performance was done in the lab. Deviating from this majority of empirical research on endogenous groups our experimental setup enables subjects to form groups in probably the most natural way: With actual friends.The research question we are addressing is: Do endogenous groups behave and perform differently than randomly assigned exogenous groups in terms of cooperation, performance, knowledge gain and satisfaction? We analyze individuals in terms of group contribution, individual learning outcomes, individual perceived contribution, individual satisfaction with the group and  group performance. Further we disentangle the observed differences between endogenous and exogenous groups into a selection and incentives effect. 
We implemented our experiment in an introductory data science course with emphasis on data analysis, reproducibility, programming and statistical inference. The course is divided into two parts, where the first part consists of a theoretical introduction into different techniques and concepts of data science, accompanied by topic specific, mandatory Problem Sets done by each student individually. In the second part of each semester students form groups of three people and do three projects together.
