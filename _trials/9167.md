abstract: "Technological advances and automation are making workplaces increasingly knowledge-intensive, with many routine and well-defined jobs becoming redundant. The new labor market requires workers with high competencies who are not afraid of change, challenges, and acquiring new skills. For many young adults, this could be a major risk factor for labor market exclusion. Indeed, today almost 10 percent of young adults in Norway are "Not in Education, Employment or Training" (NEET).

Based on protocols from psychology, we have developed an app (RØST), supporting young education or job applicants. By investigating the effects of RØST, this project will provide new knowledge about young NEETs, and how society can support them in entering the labor market or education.
