abstract: "In order to understand how loan contract design affects take up of credit, and eventual repayment rates, we test three different approaches of credit for a single product: an agricultural hip-pump. The first (“M500”) is a standard loan with monthly payments for a year. The second (“Freedom”) only requires that half of the payment be made by the middle of the year, and the full payment by the end of the year. A third contract (“Flex”) has basically the same payoff structure as the “Freedom” contract, but asks those who take up the product to make a repayment plan, and sends reminders when they pledged to pay a certain amount. This experiment uses the same sample as STRIP (https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/183/history/799), and consists of people who are in clusters where 2 people have already received the same agricultural hip-pump under different allocation mechanisms. As such, we will also be able to determine how different mechanisms to identify those who will “experiment” on the behalf of the cluster affect the demand for credit. We will also examine how a "group nudge" encouraging group ownership of the hip-pump through the provision of information relevant to group ownership affects take up of the credit offer, as well as group ownership.
