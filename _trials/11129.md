abstract: "Peer effects are a subject of increasing attention in many areas of economics research. Influence from peers can indeed generate social multiplier effects, whereby an initial investment targeting one small group can lead to larger changes, since individuals close to the target group tend to imitate them and learn from their experience. When it comes to the green transition in agriculture, the diffusion of new knowledge through peers could play a crucial role in promoting the adoption of agroecological practices. However, the conditions for successful peer learning in this context are still poorly understood. In particular, it is unknown whether the profile of the first individuals in peer groups to receive information affects its diffusion to other peers.
To answer this question, we run a randomized-controlled-trial (RCT) from a large sample of voluntary French farmers, where individuals are randomly assigned to peer groups and receive informative content for 18 months through a digital platform. Only one farmer per peer group receives the information directly, serving as the injection point of the group. Treatment varies depending on the profile of the designated injection point, which is either chosen randomly among early adopters of agroecological practices (Treatment~A) or among ordinary peers (Treatment~B). Farmers assigned to the control arm are also placed in peer groups but they receive no specific information on innovative practices (Treatment~C).
We can first verify that farmers' knowledge of agroecology can be improved by injecting informative content using a digital platform. In addition, we can measure the sharing of information between peers and test the hypothesis that receiving second-hand information can improve knowledge level. A major advantage of this protocol is that it can test the hypothesis that early adopters do better than ordinary peers, whether it is improving their own knowledge or transmitting newly acquired knowledge to their peers. Focusing on ordinary peers who receive information second-hand, who are the most representative farmers and therefore the target of public programs outside the experiment, we can further verify whether they acquire more knowledge when the information comes from an early adopter rather than from another ordinary peer."
