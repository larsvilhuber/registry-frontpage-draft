abstract: "This study assesses whether a country’s recent territorial expansion tends to whet or satiate “appetites” for further territorial expansion. Taking the case of Russia, which expanded by annexing the Crimean peninsula in 2014, it exposes randomly selected individuals either to be in a control group or to be exposed to one of the following three primes: a generic reminder that borders sometimes change in the course of history (a placebo), a statement that Russia incorporated Crimea in 2014, and the same statement about having incorporated combined with a statement that this prompted Western opposition and economic sanctions. The study then assesses whether these different primes are systematically associated with preferences regarding what the borders of Russia should be, with options including two shrinkage options, two expansion options, and one status quo option. The possibility of heterogeneous treatment effects will be explored, particularly regarding age, gender, education, ethnicity, and geographic place."
