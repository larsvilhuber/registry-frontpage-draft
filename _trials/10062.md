abstract: "Within a survey of adolescent males in Medellin schools (mainly 13-year old boys) we are randomizing whether survey respondents answer sensitive questions themselves or are asked the questions by an enumerator. Questions are of three main varieties: (1) antisocial behaviors, (2) symptoms of depression, and (3) symptoms of anxiety."
