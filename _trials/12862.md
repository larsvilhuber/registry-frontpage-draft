abstract: "Companies often obfuscate cookie preference policies and consent forms in order to nudge users to share their data more than they would otherwise do. These practices, known as “dark patterns,” are pervasive despite their effects being poorly understood. With the use of Webmunk, a browser extension developed for research studies of this type, we explore the effects of dark patterns on consumers’ privacy choices and the effects that such choices have on the type and quantity of ads they receive. We are particularly interested in how the effects of dark patterns differ across large and small companies, and the ensuing firms’ competitive advantage in consumer data."
