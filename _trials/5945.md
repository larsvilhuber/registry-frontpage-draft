abstract: "In response to the covid19 crisis, El Salvador has imposed one of the strictest lockdown policies. The severe restrictions imposed create specific challenges and costs for poorer populations. As many rely on informal work to survive, they may no longer earn an income and are at risk of falling further into poverty. At the same time, these populations may have many health problems that increase their probability of developing severe symptoms if they contract covid19. Hence the extent to which individuals support alternative policy measures may depend on their health risk perceptions, which themselves may be based on imperfect knowledge. In this study, we follow up a cohort of clients from a micro-finance organization and test whether, upon receiving information about risk factors associated with serious cases of covid19,  individuals update the perception of their own risks, and subsequently their policy support for alternative policies."
