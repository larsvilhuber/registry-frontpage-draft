abstract: "Early childhood development (ECD) interventions that provide caregiving information via home visits or group sessions have improved child development outcomes in several contexts. Yet the cost-effective scaling of these interventions with quality is a challenge. This cluster randomized evaluation (cRCT) analyzes the effects of two variations of a smartphone-based intervention on ECD outcomes compared to the Peruvian governmentâ€™s standard day care and caregiver support program. A total of 240 daycare centers with 2400 households will be randomized to receive the standard government program (Control); standard day care and the smartphone app (T1); or standard day care, the smartphone app, and parent learning groups (T2).  Primary ECD outcomes will be measured using CREDI and GSED. Secondary outcomes include intermediate caregiver outcomes and home interactions. We will estimate unadjusted and adjusted intent-to-treat effects and will analyze heterogeneous effects by child gender and either the caregiver education or a household poverty index."
