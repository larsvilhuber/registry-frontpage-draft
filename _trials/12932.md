abstract: "This impact evaluation will assess the impact of the Home-Grown School Feeding (HGSF) Programme on the local economy (i.e. farmers and farmer organisations) in Kasungu district in Malawi. The programme is funded by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad) and implemented by the Government of Malawi in partnership with the World Food Programme. 

The WFP Malawi CO currently covers 523 schools in 8 districts. In total 676,000 children in 523 schools have received school feeding in 2023. In Kasungu district, 132 schools are receiving school meals in 2023, for a total of 94,490 children. 

Schools involved in the Home-Grown School Feeding Programme procure food from local smallholder farmers’ associations and cooperatives within a radius of 20 km from the school. The procurement process is conducted every three months at the school level. Farmer Organisations (FOs), including farmer associations and cooperatives, are invited to participate in the tender process, and the FO with the best bidding offer is awarded a contract to supply to the school for the next three months. 

To assess the impacts of the HGSF programme on farmer organisations (FOs) and their members, the evaluation will rely on a randomised encouragement design intended to increase the likelihood for farmer organisations to access the market opportunities created by the HGSF programme. Eligible FOs have been identified to take part in the school tendering process in the Kasungu district. The evaluation will randomly encourage half of them to participate in the school tendering process by providing a set of additional activities expected to increase the likelihood for the FO to succeed in the bid. The remaining FOs will still be eligible to submit bids to schools. The experimental variation in the additional activities will be used to assess the impact on cooperatives and farmers.

The evaluation will conduct three school surveys in the schools receiving the HGSF programme, three farmer organisation (FO) surveys among all the eligible cooperatives involved in the encouragement design component, and two farmer surveys with farmers from eligible FOs. "
