abstract: "Muslim countries have experienced a drastic rise in the number of civil wars, and religion is assumed to be central to these armed conflicts. Muslims in countries experiencing armed conflicts perform religious rituals more frequently and express stronger religious beliefs than Muslims in peaceful countries. These patterns have led researchers to focus on whether and to what extent religiosity leads to support for violence among Muslims. This study argues that we need to focus on the reverse causal relationship: how violence leads to religious intensity as a psychological coping mechanism. Building on psychological theories of religion, I argue that exposure to violence leads to religious intensity among civilians, regardless of their support for Islamist militant groups. After exposure to violence, those who are initially less supportive of Islamist militant groups express stronger religious beliefs but even less support for Islamist militant groups and religious institutions supporting Islamist militancy. The research design takes advantage of the as-if random nature of insurgent violence and includes a survey experiment to assess how reminding civilians the increased risk of violence affects their religious beliefs."
