abstract: "We use a randomized online survey experiment to understand how the participation rate in a binary threshold public good game is affected by group size and by a safer option of participating (i.e., participating is always beneficial instead of being risky). After the treatment, we also ask a series of questions related to Covid19 and attitudes toward vaccination to test whether there is correlation between participation to the public good game and vaccination.
A total of 1,500 subjects in Italy will be recruited using a sample provided by a vendor. The subjects are representative of the Italian population for age and geographical location. Subjects are compensated for their participation and are also incentivized in the participation to the games: an additional compensation is provided and depends on the results obtained in the games. 
Prior to completing any survey content, respondents will confirm that they are over 18 and located in Italy. If they are not, they are not allowed to continue. Similarly, participants who do not correctly answer a comprehension question about a short newspaper article they are asked to read will not be allowed to continue to the main survey content."
