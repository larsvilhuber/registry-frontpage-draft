abstract: "Tutoring has become widespread, particularly in developing countries. A two-stage randomized controlled trial was implemented of an after-school free tutoring program conducted in 254 schools over two years from year 2013 to year 2015 in rural Bangladesh. The program offered students in primary schools group-based private tutoring and/or a weekly one-to-one home visit. In the PT-only treatment, tutors provided two hours of teaching English and Math to students in a group setting. In the HPT treatment, in addition to receiving tutoring in a group setting, students received one-hour one-on-one instruction from a tutor every week. The purpose of the home visit was to provide individualized sessions, teaching at the studentsâ€™ level to identify the individual learning gap and meet their learning needs.

The RCT involved a two-stage design where, in the first stage, all schools were randomly assigned as either treatment or control schools. The second stage involved randomly selecting subgroups of students from each grade within each treatment school and offering them the intervention.

The intervention lasted for two years from year 2013 to year 2015, and various dimensions of data collected at different period of time. Examples include test scores and non-cognitive skills of students, parent, teacher and school information. Successful randomization is guaranteed based on the fact that student-level characteristics and school-level variables are balanced across groups. Then the effect of the program on educational outcomes of students was estimated. "
