abstract: "Aggregation metrics in reputation systems are important for overcoming information overload. When using
these metrics, technical aggregation functions such as the arithmetic mean are implemented to measure the
valence of product ratings. However, it is unclear whether the implemented aggregation functions match the
inherent aggregation patterns of customers. In our experiment, we elicit customersâ€™ aggregation heuristics
and contrast these with reference functions. Our findings indicate that, overall, the arithmetic mean performs
best in comparison with other aggregation functions. However, our analysis on an individual level reveals
heterogeneous aggregation patterns. Major clusters exhibit a binary bias (i.e., an over-weighting of moderate
ratings and under-weighting of extreme ratings) in combination with the arithmetic mean. Minor clusters
focus on 1-star ratings or negative (i.e., 1-star and 2-star) ratings. Thereby, inherent aggregation patterns
are neither affected by variation of provided information nor by individual characteristics such as experience,
risk attitudes, or demographics."
