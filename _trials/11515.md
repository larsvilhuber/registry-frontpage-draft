abstract: "his research will study individual attitudes towards inter-generational transfers such as parental gifts and bequests.
Many parents leave their wealth upon death to their children or provide gifts inter vivos. For the rich, such bequests
and transfers comprise a substantial portion of their lifetime wealth. With rising income inequality in almost
all western democracies, a growing concern is that such inter-generational transfer of wealth may hinder equal
opportunity for all. In the hope of leveling the playing field from consequences of such a birth lottery, many
countries implement a progressive estate or inheritance tax on transfers above a threshold. However, like most
public policies that have redistributive implications, estate or bequest taxation is a controversial subject. Support
for the tax is derived from attributing bequests as unearned income and is rooted in meritocratic principles that
accept income inequalities based on hard work but not those based on luck. On the other hand, opposition to the
tax is based on the idea that it penalizes loving parents who are entitled to leave their hard-earned earnings to their
kin. In this project, we investigate individuals' attitudes towards redistribution when considering inter-generational
transfers. We focus on understanding to what extent individuals consider inter-generational transfer of money a
natural right or an undue privilege. "
