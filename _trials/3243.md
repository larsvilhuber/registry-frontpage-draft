abstract: "Cash transfer programs have become extremely popular in the developing world. This registration references a study to evaluate the impacts of a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program in Nicaragua that began in 2000 and ended in 2005. The evaluation was coordinated by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and the Government of Nicaragua and sponsored by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). The CCT was designed to address both current and future poverty through cash transfers targeted to poor and extremely poor households in rural Nicaragua. Its specific stated objectives included: 1) supplementing household income for up to three years to increase expenditures on food; 2) reducing dropout rates during the first four years of primary school; and 3) increasing the nutritional status and healthcare of children under five. The CCT first targeted the rural areas in six municipalities from three regions in central and northern Nicaragua on the basis of poverty as well as on local capacity to implement the program. It included 42 rural localities. After an initial census in May 2000, the study collected baseline survey information for a subset of households in 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2004. "
