abstract: "This IE evaluates the impact of subsidized delivery of agricultural inputs on food security and agricultural revenue, particularly focusing on targeting of youth.  Within the sample, farmers of varying ages are offered the subsidized seeds and tools and also sent an SMS based e-voucher enabling them to buy rice or fertilizer.  The IE studies the impact of these inputs on household outcomes and tests whether youth or more experienced farmers are the best targets for similar programs."
