abstract: "In this project, we investigate virtual coworking, where participants join timed, quiet digital work sessions that begin with goal-setting and end with progress debriefing. We randomize participants into control and virtual coworking treatment, where treated participants engage in a five-day, three-hours-per-day virtual coworking program. Effectiveness will be measured by comparing scholarly output and psychosocial measures between the control and treatment groups. Additionally, we aim to understand the heterogeneous effects of virtual coworking based on participants' demographics as well as group members' demographics and behavior."
