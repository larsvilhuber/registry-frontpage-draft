abstract: "Using a laboratory experiment, we aim to study a new game, the courtesy game. The courtesy game is a simultaneous two-player game in which each player must choose between two strategies, X and Y. Game parameters are designed such that both playersâ€™ weakly dominant strategy is X, and the strategy profile (X, X) is a Nash equilibrium. Moreover, there are two other asymmetric Nash equilibria (X, Y) and (Y, X), that are Pareto efficient to the symmetric Nash equilibrium, and yielding the X-player the higher payoff. Thus, the Y-player is the courteous player, who accepts a lower payoff than her opponent in order to achieve efficiency.  However, choosing Y is accompanied with a courtesy dilemma, since the strategy profile (Y, Y) yields the worst outcome for both players. In different variations of the game (one shot, repeated) we test if players play the weakly dominant strategy X or the courteous strategy Y."
