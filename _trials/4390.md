abstract: "Keeping incentives fixed and assuming stability of preferences over time –are cooperative preferences
sensitive to context? In particular, do subjects change their behavior when going from a context in
which a new public good has to be created to a context in which one has to maintain an existing
one? We elicit the cooperative preferences of a representative sample of the Norwegian population
at two points in time, and examine whether their preferences are stable between a provision and
maintenance context. Second, in a framed public goods experiment, we randomize subjects into
either an information treatment intended to affect beliefs about others’ behavior or a control group
with no information. We seek to examine whether the elicited types and their degree of stability lead
to heterogeneous effects of the information treatment."
