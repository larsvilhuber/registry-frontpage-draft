abstract: "This project aims to study the effect of choice-set history on the trade-off between equality and efficiency. I conduct an incentivized spectator game, where subjects through eleven decision problems choose between two distributions of money for pairs of anonymous stakeholders. In the first ten, I manipulate the efficiency of one distribution in the choice-set in order to test for path-dependence and spillovers to the eleventh decision. The main hypothesis is that repeated exposure to high efficiency costs leads to a normalization of high efficiency costs, and thus increased acceptance towards outcomes that are more equal but less efficient, in subsequent choices."
