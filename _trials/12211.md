abstract: "A growing body of research suggests that gender norms within the household play an important role in constraining female labor supply (Bursztyn, Fujiwara, and Pallais 2017; Folke and Rickne 2020; Bursztyn, González, and Yanagizawa-Drott 2020). One norm that has attracted particular attention is the “breadwinning” norm – the idea that in heterosexual married couples, husbands should earn more than their wives. Despite considerable work in this area, there is still ongoing debate as to whether these norms explain the high density of married women who earn slightly less than their husbands (Bertrand, Kamenica, and Pan 2015; Zinovyeva and Tverdostup 2021; Gupta 2022). Moreover, if these norms are binding, it is unclear whether they are driven by self-image or social-image concerns and how they emerge in the bargaining process. There are two major challenges to answering these questions. The first is that cleanly measuring these preferences requires exogenous variation of wages in the vicinity of the husband’s income. The second is that to identify mechanisms one needs to measure preferences at different points in the bargaining process, as well as self-image and social-image concerns. To handle these challenges, we have partnered with a large vocational training provider in India that routinely connects its trainees with real job opportunities. This unique setting allows us to build an experiment to generate experimental variation in wages of job choices. We also plan to measure women’s gender attitudes, their beliefs about their peers’ attitudes, and how their preferences change before and after bargaining with their husbands."
