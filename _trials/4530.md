abstract: "In the experiment, we study the impact of renting out a plot on the plot and on the plot owner. A random sample of interested farmers receives a subsidy conditional on renting out a "target plot" (which is identified at baseline for all groups). Another group receives an unconditional subsidy. A final group is allocated to control. In a "first stage," we examine the impact of the rental subsidy on the likelihood that the target plot is rented out. In the main analysis, we plan to study the impact of renting out (instrumented with the subsidy) on plot-level and owner-level outcomes. The unconditional cash transfers will help shed light on the mechanisms behind this impact.
