abstract: "Gender discrimination correlates negatively with important development outcomes. The relationship is likely to be causal to some extent and the issue becomes particularly salient when gender discrimination is encoded in law (Duflo 2012; Jayachandran 2015). Legal reform, however, may be hindered or invalidated by restrictive social norms (Rosenblum 2015; Roy 2015 and Bhalotra et al. 2020). This research aims to provide a better understanding of the malleability of social norms in the context of Islamic inheritance law in Tunisia. The current inheritance law systematically favors sons over daughters and has been contested by a large social movement since 2018. While legal reform seems unlikely today, gifting provides an alternative way of alleviating gender discrimination in inheritance privately. Within a randomized informational experiment conducted via the phone, I test whether providing information on public support for legal reform and gifting one’s daughter has a causal impact on attitudes regarding women’s right to inheritance. Further outcomes will allow for a better understanding of public opinion on inheritance law reform and shed light on whether gifting can be perceived as second-best solution relative to inheritance law reform."
