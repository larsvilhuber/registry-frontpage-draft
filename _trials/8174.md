abstract: "Advancing youth's financial inclusion requires a better understanding of their financial needs and promoting financial education programs that can endow them with the skills to use financial services effectively. While traditional lecture-based formats have proven effective to deliver financial education in the school setting, there is limited evidence on how to reach out-of-school youth successfully using programs suited for more and more technologically-savvy generations. We study the impact of a mobile app to record daily financial transactions, coupled with enumerator monitoring visits every two weeks, on youth's investment in financial literacy and financial behavior.
