abstract: "Financial record keeping is rarely practised among farmers in low/middle income countries despite it being crucial to running a successful business. Through a randomised control trial we propose to study the impact of a digital farm financial management tool developed in conjunction with the Peoples Action for National Integration (PANI). The app, which will be deployed among small and marginal farmers in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India from November 2024, will enable them to record and review their expenses and income over the agricultural season. A comparison of the farmers having received the app with those that did not will enable us to measure the direct impact of farm financial management on production choices, revenue and profits. This project will employ empirical methods for robust causal inference on the behaviour of agricultural market participants to further our understanding of barriers to economic growth within the sector and consequently highlight potential paths to reducing income/wealth disparities."
