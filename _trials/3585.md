abstract: "The Crianza Positiva text and voice messaging program is a 25-week experimental intervention developed for families that participated in an 8-week positive parenting workshop that promotes parenting affective, formative, protective and reflective competencies. The contents of the text and voice messaging program were designed to increase the saliency of the skills exercised during the workshop, help simplify complex tasks in simpler components, make the future benefits of current parental effort more notorious and contribute to enhance parental self-esteem by helping parents identify their strengths and resources and work on their self-care. The aim of the text and voice messages is to make parents exercise more effectively the practices incorporated during the workshop, make parents develop and sustain positive parenting habits and make parents end up dedicating more time, better-quality time and more economic resources to their children.
