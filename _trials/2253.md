abstract: "In the prototypical contingent valuation survey, respondents are tasked with voting for or against a government program that improves an environmental amenity (Arrow et al., 1993). Researchers then vary the size of the one-time tax funding the program and use the resulting vote shares to trace out demand for the environmental amenity. In this study we start by reviewing the theoretical underpinnings of this exercise and the challenges advanced by critics. We then propose a new model of respondent behavior that incorporates concerns for the environmental amenity and social image. Through the lens of this model, earlier work challenging the contingent valuation methodology is explained and demand for the environmental amenity is still recoverable. We then adapt the contingent valuation survey commissioned by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to estimate the value of damages caused by the 3.2 million barrels of oil released into the Gulf of Mexico by the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill in 2010 using our model.
