abstract: "The high prevalence of digital financial fraud makes it difficult for businesses to distinguish between real communications from digital service providers and fraudulent communication. This could lead to a lack of trust in, and usage of digital financial services. Through a field experiment and a combination of administrative data and self-reported responses, we test two strategies for preventing non-institutional fraud: an anti-fraud campaign and a technical intervention – a unique communications code – which verifies the provenance of messages sent from a digital platform. First, we assess whether these anti-fraud interventions reduce susceptibility to fraudulent communications, and confidence in one’s ability to avoid fraud. Second, we test how these interventions affect trust in, and usage of financial services. We analyze how these impacts differ within key subgroups, including by demographic characteristics, socio-economic status, and risk preferences. Findings from this study will help improve consumer protection and support digital security in the financial and non-financial service sectors.   "
