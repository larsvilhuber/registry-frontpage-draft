abstract: "This trial involves prompting and priming honesty among Guatemalan taxpayers filing declarations for income tax (ISR) or value added tax (IVA). Messages designed to induce more honest declarations are included as part of a series of CAPTCHA security systems which participants must complete in order to complete their declaration forms for these taxes.
The primary objective of the trial is to increase honesty in tax declaration. Following previous research in this area, we argue that more honest declarations will typically be report a higher tax liability than dishonest ones. The trial is important as Guatemala has the lowest rate of tax collection in Latin America (OECD, 2014).
The trial involves all people eligible to pay at least one of four taxes who complete a tax return online between July and November 2014 (approximately 1,600,000 individuals), who will be randomly allocated to either see one of six honesty prompts, or be part of a control group. Unlike other studies of tax compliance, this study targets people who are in the process of declaring their tax, rather than late or non-payers.
The intervention is delivered at the point of accessing an online declaration form. Participants are required to complete a CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) that verifies that they are a human being completing the form rather than an automated process. Our interventions consist of a series of messages inserted into the CAPTCHA pop-up. 
The trial aims to test the differential impact of the original CAPTCHA (which contains no behavioural prompts), and various prompts inspired by behavioural science. These include an honesty declaration, information about public goods paid for by taxes and punishment for noncompliance, and allowing participants to choose what they believe to be a good use for public funds, or an appropriate punishment. We hypothesise that these primes will induce more honest (higher) tax declarations through various cognitive channels.
