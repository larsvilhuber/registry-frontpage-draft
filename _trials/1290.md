abstract: "This project seeks to establish and provide a micro-foundation for the presence of wage floors in village agricultural labor markets. Specifically, we posit that during times of high seasonal unemployment, some workers find it privately optimal to take up jobs at wages lower than the prevailing wage, but do not do so because this would result in sanctions from co-villagers. The study uses a field experiment in rural Indian villages to test for evidence that village laborers act as informal unions and are willing to pay a cost to enforce the wage floor. The design is implemented in partnership with local landowners to offer employment to randomly-selected workers during the agricultural lean season. It varies, at the village-level, both the wages for the jobs (either at the prevailing wage or at 10% below the prevailing wage) and the observability of the offers (in public in the village, or in private, within the worker’s home). If communities behave as an informal union, then (some) workers will be willing to accept work at a wage cut in private, but there will be a large decline in take-up when the job is offered in public. In contrast, we predict that the observability of workers’ take-up decisions will not affect labor supply when jobs are offered at the prevailing wage. In addition, we seek to provide positive evidence for the idea that workers impose sanctions on co-villagers if they accept a job below the prevailing wage. In a costly punishment game, laborers are given anonymized information about the real take-up decisions of other laborers in the same village. They are asked if they wish to give away money from their own endowments to reduce the amount that other individual receives.
