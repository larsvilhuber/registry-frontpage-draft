abstract: "This trial evaluates the impact of different strategies to increase property tax compliance amongst property owners within the context of a broader property tax reform in Kenema, Sierra Leone. The setting is characterized by low tax compliance, limited state capacity, limited provision of public services, limited and inconsistent enforcement strategies, and a low perception of legitimacy and trust in the local government. 

The objective of this study is to evaluate experimentally how i) increased investments in the capacity of the state to levy taxes, ii) increased civic culture, and iii) increased perception of state effectiveness can help expand fiscal capacity and ultimately affect state effectiveness.  

This will be done through three interventions: 

1) an enforcement intervention in which defaulters are summoned to a court proceeding, 

2) a religious sensitization campaign in which representatives of respected religious institutions motivate defaulter property owners to comply with the property tax, and 

3) a public information campaign in which the enforcement activities are made more salient by targeted press coverage describing the enforcement action taken in the city. 

We structure the enforcement and the religious interventions in a factorial design to estimate the complementarities between the two interventions. We then estimate the effect of the intervention both on compliance with property taxation and on different measures of perceptions of state capacity, perceptions of quality of local governance, and conditional and unconditional tax morale. We measure compliance using administrative payment data from the Kenema City Council and measure attitudes towards taxation using multiple rounds of data collection. We then implement the public information intervention during the following tax cycle by randomly exposing property owners to the pamphlets. We track the evolution of attitudes, perceptions, and compliance in the context of state effectiveness and property taxation."
