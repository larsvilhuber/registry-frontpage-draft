abstract: "There has been extensive research on setting optimal tax rates but there is little research on the impacts of improving tax administration. This project investigates the effects of tax administration on tax collection in Indonesia through multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The studies will estimate the tax administration production function by measuring the impact of exogenous capital and labor shocks on tax revenue and compliance in a national sample of tax offices, and investigate how complex organizations respond to improvements in resources. The studies are being conducted in close partnership with the Indonesian government, which is implementing the three interventions as part of their regular operations. The purpose of the this RCT is to estimate the impact of the government providing an exogenous increase in tax office labor (providing each office with between 2-5 additional tax officers for two years) on tax revenue and compliance in 83 randomly assigned tax offices out of a sample of 170 tax offices across Indonesia."
