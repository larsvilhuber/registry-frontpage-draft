abstract: "This study employs a social experiment combined with population-wide register-based data to evaluate a comprehensive employer-sponsored health and well-being program, rolled out to about 7,500 healthcare workers in Denmark. The experiment took place over two years (2008-2009), involved in excess of 100 employers, and covered more than 300 work-units. The program consisted of health screenings and exercise during working hours as well as shorter courses on the promotion of healthy living targeted towards key employees. We find that individuals employed at worksites randomized into the program receive fewer services from their primary care physician, just as we detect a decrease in prescription drug purchases. These effects persist both during the course of the program but also in the medium-run. We find no evidence of adverse effects on hospitalizations – a severe health outcome – in the long-run; in fact, results indicate that the incidence of hospitalizations due to mental and behavioral diseases is lower three to seven years after randomization. At the same time we find no evidence that the program was successful in improving the primary managerial goals associated with the intervention, namely absenteeism and turnover. Finally, we show evidence of spillovers within the family; spouses’ health care utilization decreases in the short run too."
