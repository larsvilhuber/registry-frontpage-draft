abstract: "People who believe to live in a society with high social mobility generally prefer significantly less redistribution. However, people hold highly inaccurate beliefs about the amount of social mobility. A plausible reason why these beliefs are so inaccurate is that people do not only form beliefs with the intention to maximize accuracy, but rather they might also hold motivated beliefs. With our study we aim to understand (i) whether people hold motivated beliefs with regards to social mobility and, if they do, (ii) which kinds of motivated beliefs are most important in influencing their redistribution preferences.
We study two types of motivated beliefs about social mobility that relate to preferences for redistribution. For one, people might be overconfident with respect to the degree of upward mobility that they will experience, which leads them to prefer less redistribution. Apart from that, people may hold a specific redistribution preference in the first place and then form their beliefs about social mobility in order to justify their redistribution preferences.
We test for (i) the existence of overconfidence and/or "justifying beliefs" with regards to social mobility as well as (ii) their relative importance for the redistribution preferences in an online experiment on Prolific.
In the control group, subjects perform an effort task and indicate their belief about their rank in the effort task. A subjectâ€™s payoff is either determined by her rank in the effort task or by sheer luck. We tell subjects about their payoff, but not whether it was their effort or luck that determined this payoff. We then ask subjects about how likely they think it is that their payoff was determined by effort rather than luck. After that, subjects get to vote on the amount of a redistributional tax which comes at an efficiency cost. In the control group, neither overconfidence nor justifying beliefs matter for the preferences for redistribution by design.
In our overconfidence treatment, we allow overconfidence to affect the redistribution preferences by not telling subjects about their payoff before the vote for their preferred tax rates, thereby giving overconfident subjects room to state a lower preferred tax rate compared to the absence of overconfidence. In our justifying beliefs treatment, subjects are aware of the subsequent tax voting when they are asked about their beliefs regarding the role of effort vs luck. Thus, they can potentially report higher (lower) beliefs about the importance of effort in determining payoffs in order to justify a low (high) redistribution preference.
We compare differences in beliefs and preferred tax rates across treatments in order to assess whether or not motivated beliefs about social mobility exist in our setting at all and, if they do, in order to assess their impact on preferences for redistribution.
