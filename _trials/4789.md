abstract: "In this study, we work with Mars Corporation (owners of the Wrigley Kenya) to offer microfinance contracts to fund the purchase of a bicycle for microentrepreneurs who work under Wrigley's micro-distribution programme in Kenya, "Maua". Our sample consists of micro-distributors, many of whom sell retail products (which include chewing gum) on foot, and who would like to finance the purchase of a bicycle to expand their micro-distribution activities.
