abstract: "This study investigates through a priming experiment whether political symbols - in this case, country flags - influence nationalist attitudes. Apart from a control group, which is not shown any symbols, four randomly selected subsets of individuals in the study are primed by being shown a variety of flags: first, the Russian flag; second, the flag of the Soviet Union; third, the flag of the European Union; and fourth, the United States flag. The study will then assess whether these primes drive different levels of nationalist attitudes among respondents through a grid question. The study will also explore whether effects vary by nationalist attitudes measured prior to the experiment in the same survey, as well as by key demographics such as age, ethnicity, gender, income, and party support.
