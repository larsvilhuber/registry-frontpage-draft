abstract: "In the context of the coronavirus epidemic, we measure people's expectations on their future income and the economic outlook in the country as a whole; their beliefs on the responsibility of the Chinese and U.S. federal and state governments for the crisis; their support for certain policies (social distancing, and requiring reparations from China); and their expected vote choice and participation in the 2020 U.S. elections. We identify the sociodemographic and attitudinal factors that best predict people's attitudes about the crisis and their expected voting behavior. Using a survey experiment, we provide causal evidence on the impact of four treatments on these outcomes. The first two treatments are intended to generate exogenous variation in respondents' level of distrust and the structure of paranoia. In turn, this will enable us to estimate the impact of distrust and paranoia on our final outcomes. The last two treatments are intended to generate exogenous variation in respondents' economic beliefs (both with respect to their own expected income and the economic outlook in the country as a whole). In turn, this will enable us to estimate the impact of these beliefs on our final outcomes. We will compare the magnitude of the impact of distrust and paranoia to the magnitude of the impact of economic beliefs. We will measure treatment impact heterogeneity along economic situation, assessed and actual seriousness of the crisis, ideology, preexisting distrust and paranoia, and predicted populist vote. The survey experiment is conducted with two distinct samples: a sample of about 10,000 M-Turk respondents; and (in a different format, only including the two first treatments), a nationally representative online sample of about 2,000 respondents, tracked over time."
