abstract: "We ran a two-and-a-half year field experiment in a commune in the Red River Delta Region served by a single water utility. About 1,500 households connected to piped water were randomly divided into three groups. We then rolled out a price subsidy scheme and collect monthly information on water consumption use. 

We use these data to estimate a dynamic structural model of water demand with habit formation. Under our maintained assumption that consumers do not internalize the effect of their future habits in deciding on their current piped water usage, consumption depends only on the current price and on past usage. Our experiment, by generating random variation in price, not only allows us to identify the (short-run) price elasticity of piped water demand, but also delivers valid instruments for estimating the effect of past consumption on current consumption and, by extension, the effect of current consumption on future consumption. With these preference parameter estimates, we can compute both ex-ante and ex-post willingness-to-pay as well as short-run and long-run price elasticities of demand. 

We numerically solve for the optimal pricing scheme given consumer preferences as well as information on fixed investment and operating costs provided to us by the water utility. "
