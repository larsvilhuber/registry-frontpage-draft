abstract: "The World Health Organization recommends breastfeeding until 6 months of age “to achieve optimal growth, development, and health.”  Yet by five months of age only 42% of infants in Kenya are exclusively breastfed.  In impoverished peri-urban communities, these rates may be much lower, with one study in Nairobi estimating a 2% rate EBF until 6 months. This study evaluates the impact of an interactive SMS intervention designed to provide information about breastfeeding and to assist women in addressing challenges that arise. "
