abstract: "Political preferences and behaviors of individuals play a crucial role in shaping political decisions within democratic societies. In this study, we investigate what determines heterogeneities in these domains. Specifically, we analyze socio-economic correlates and investigate the causal impact of the social environment through the random assignment of children to a year-long mentoring program."
