abstract: "How does banning firms from seeking applicantsâ€™ wage histories affect employment and salary offers? We implement a field experiment in which recruiters evaluate job applications that randomly include or exclude salary information questions and disclosures. The experiment mimics laws passed in Massachusetts, California, New York City, and Chicago banning these questions. Applicants also vary by gender and whether their previous salaries are high or low in the distribution of their previous firms salaries.  We test several hypotheses about how salary disclosure might impact wage offers and gender inequality.  We will also run one arm of the trial with subjects who are aware they are in an experiment. This takes the form of altered recruitment language that is clearly from academics and the addition of a signed informed consent form (everything else being the same) to test how this changes average outcomes.
