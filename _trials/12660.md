abstract: "Using an experimental design during a wine tasting, the study aims to study the composite reaction of the consumer to the information relative to a non conventional wine making method.
Subjects will be allocated to degustation sessions that will be characterised by increased levels of information on the wine making methodology. Tasting descriptors and qualitative assessments will be compared across treatments together with willingness to pay and preferences for visiting the wine producer."
