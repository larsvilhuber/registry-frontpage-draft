abstract: "The study aims to measure the potential of right-wing populism given the immigration rise to Ecuador since 2013. Here, a survey experiment will take place measuring peopleâ€™s behavior (anti-immigration, populist vote, altruism, and anger). The theoretical background of these experiments lies on populism, political communication, and exogenous events affecting voting behavior. "
