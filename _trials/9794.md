abstract: "In this project, we study whether firms manage their earnings and the key drivers that influence the probability of firms conducting earnings management. Companies take various measures to achieve their earnings targets. Financial reporting regulations give firm decision makers (some) flexibility in the way they present information allowing them to manipulate figures deliberately and actively according to their own objectives. The prevalence of earnings management, however, is difficult to quantify since archival data is silent on the decision-making process. Survey methods may overcome this problem. However, given the sensitive nature of earnings management, issues such as measurement error (non-response, recall bias, social desirability bias) may arise. To elicit truthful answers to sensitive questions, we run a double list experiment (Droitcour et al., 1991) and compare the estimates of the proportion of firms that engage in earnings management to those from direct and indirect questioning."
