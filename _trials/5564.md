abstract: "In earlier work (Brooks, Donovan, and Johnson, 2018) we studied the impact of a mentorship program among female microenterprise owners in Dandora, Kenya. This study will test various margins of our original design to better understand the impact of microenterprise mentorship. The first is whether an optimal matching algorithm can generate larger effects than random matching. To do so, we will use our previous work to compute the optimal matching protocol. We will then compare firms who receive a mentor via that protocol and compare to another treatment arm of random matching (the baseline in Brooks, Donovan, and Johson, 2018). Second, we will study the extent to which mentees can pass mentor information to other firms. To do so, we will randomly assign mentees to mentor control firms after 6 months. Finally, we will ask the extent to which our optimal matching protocol predicts excess benefits relative to random matching in other locations."
