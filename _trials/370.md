abstract: "In Egypt, inequalities of opportunity in the labour market are critically high and are believed to be one of the causes for the current unrest in the country. In 2010, while the overall unemployment rate was 9%, it had reached 16.6% and 55.8% respectively for men and women between 20 and 24 (ILO, statistics). Both theoretical and anecdotal evidence suggest that fostering youth entrepreneurship may be an adequate policy to tackle these issues. In particular, while 53.6% of young Egyptians express a preference for having their own business over a salaried job, only 1.2% are self-employed due to credit constraints and a lack of business information (Population Council, 2009). However there is still little robust evidence showing a causal impact of programs promoting entrepreneurship on labour market indicators or indicating the most effective mode of delivery for such trainings.

As part of the Taqeem initiative (a project by ILO’s Youth Employment Network and Silatech), we propose to evaluate the effects of an innovative youth entrepreneurship reality TV show in Egypt, El Mashrou3 by Bamyan Media. El Mashrou3 uses an entertaining approach to teach an expected audience of 8-10 million Egyptians entrepreneurial skills and good business practices, and to introduce them to local partners delivering entrepreneurship training, mentorship, finance and technology services etc. In addition to the show, support activities will be carried out to create a bridge between the reality show and the real world: a website will be created so that viewers may find online courses, educational videos, mentoring services etc., and viewing parties as well as networking events will also be organized. 

We will run a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the combined effects of our interventions. As the TV show is being broadcasted nationally on a satellite channel and the website is available to all, we propose to use an encouragement design. Respondents will be randomly allocated to different groups differing only by the amount of encouragements they will receive to watch the show and participate in the support activities. Paying close attention to heterogeneous and personal network effects, we will evaluate the impact of the interventions on business practices, employment status, skills and attitudes towards business. 

In doing so, we hope not only to better our understanding of the impact of such “edutainment” programs and entrepreneurship trainings but also to inform the design of future public policies, in particular those fighting unemployment and precariousness."
