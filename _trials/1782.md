abstract: "Natural disasters, like earthquakes and floods, can cause great losses in human and physical capital. The impacts can be particularly troublesome in developing countries that often lack preparedness to such events. Catastrophes hit the poor and vulnerable especially hard and have led to recurrent humanitarian disasters in the past years. They heighten already existing vulnerabilities in the communities, such as lack of proper shelter, livelihoods, and sanitation, which contribute to disease spread and malnutrition. Economic research on how to mitigate the consequences of natural disasters through recovery and preparedness interventions represents a real research gap. Among the most natural disaster-affected countries in the world is Pakistan. The underlying study aims to make a contribution to the literature by setting-up a randomized control trial (RCT) in areas which faces the highest needs of recovery and humanitarian aid after having been heavily and recurrently affected by disasters in the past. Pakistan's recurrent disasters leave behind critical gaps and heighten vulnerabilities within affected communities. Natural disasters are often followed by chronic malnutrition. In this setting, humanitarian aid interventions targeting areas that face a high likelihood of being exposed to the next natural disaster or emergency are key to prevent degradation of the often already fragile situation and to make communities more resilient when future disasters occur. The intention of the interventions is to build local capacities, meet life-saving needs, support community-level recovery and enhance resilience for the future. "
