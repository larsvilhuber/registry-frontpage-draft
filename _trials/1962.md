abstract: "Economic theory and preliminary evidence suggest that by investing in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), firms can increase workers’ performance. However, to date the specific mechanisms by which CSR should increase workers’ performance are still unknown, and therefore, no definite conclusion can be yet made about if and when this effect should be expected. One distinction in particular seems to be important: does it matter for workers whether CSR is done strategically (i.e. purely to increase profits) or not? This project investigates the effect of strategic CSR versus non-strategic CSR on workers’ performance. The task is to create marketing slogans for pharmaceutical products promoted by an Italian company. We randomize participants’ exposure to different types of CSR investments made by the company and assess its effect on the number of slogans they create. CSR investments take the form of a donation to a charity. "
