abstract: "This research investigates the effectiveness of providing teachers with supports for integrating Khan Academy programming with their math instruction. The study will be conducted as a randomized control trial comparing math achievement of students whose teachers have been offered support from a Khan Academy “Khollaborator” to students whose teachers do not receive the Khollaborator support and conduct their math instruction as usual. Teachers in the treatment group will also receive regular progress reports and support for communicating with parents and students. Results will provide information about how to most effectively align Khan Academy with classroom efforts, and how doing so impacts students’ math achievement. "
