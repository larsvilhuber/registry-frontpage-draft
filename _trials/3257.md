abstract: "A basic requirement for free markets to allocate capital to those with the highest return is that willingness-to-pay for capital is increasing in returns. Credit constraints may interfere with the efficient functioning of markets if they constrain the willingness-to-pay of those with high returns. We investigate these issues in the context of the market for chemical fertilizer in Uganda. Using an incentive-compatible mechanism, we study the relationship between farmers’ willingness-to-pay for fertilizer and their return to fertilizer. We also study how this relationship changes when farmers’ credit constraints are relaxed by receiving a large cash transfer prior to willingness-to-pay elicitation."
