abstract: "Research on the effects of mindfulness – the awareness that arises from paying attention, on purpose, in the present moment and adopting a deliberately open, non-judgmental and impartial view toward one’s thoughts and feelings – suggests that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have the potential to increase individual well-being. At the same time, the interpersonal effects of MBIs are less clear. This study investigates whether the effects of a short MBI on the self-serving bias in a variant of the Nash demand game is contingent on the self-construal of individuals. In addition, we investigate if a more independent self-construal according to the Twenty Statements Test is correlated with more selfish behavior in a dictator game."
