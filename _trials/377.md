abstract: "This study assesses the effects of radio spots designed to discourage vote-buying and vote-selling in the context of the 2014 Indian national elections. Medium-wattage radio stations were randomly assigned to treatment and control conditions, with treatment stations airing a series of three vignettes that satirize and discourage vote-buying.  Outcomes include total votes cast, especially for candidates that according to local journalists and/or the Electoral Commission, are suspected of large-scale vote-buying."
