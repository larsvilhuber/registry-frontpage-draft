abstract: "Using social media to distribute health related information has become increasingly common, especially in light of the recent Covid-19 pandemic. In this study, we assess whether social media – in particular Facebook – can serve as an efficient and cost-effective tool to increase the awareness about diabetes type 2 in Indonesia, where the prevalence of  the diesease – and with it the rates of undiagnosed cases – has dramatically increased in the last decade. We use Facebook’s advertisement function to randomly distribute informative ads related to the risk and consequences of diabetes to Indonesian Facebook users above the age of 21. The ads differ in their content and graphical design, but equally invite viewers of the ads to visit an information website on which they can participate in a diabetes self-screening activity (Findrisk test), which determines the risk of having or developing diabetes. Depending on their determined risk score, participants will receive a recommendation to contact their GP and ask for an in-depth screening. We investigate which type of advertisement content and graphic is able to generate the highest number of clicks, website visits and completed screenings per view to derive policy recommendations about (cost-)effective designs for health-related awareness campaigns in the context of surging rates of non-communicable diseases in low-and middle-income countries."
