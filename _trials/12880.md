abstract: "As extreme weather events become more frequent and severe, agricultural households face increasing challenges in adapting. There is an urgent need for policy tools that can assist households in coping with these events. Anticipatory humanitarian action is a novel approach where humanitarian organizations use meteorological forecasts to proactively distribute humanitarian assistance to households before disasters occur. This anticipatory distribution of assistance aims to prevent or reduce humanitarian impacts before they fully unfold. This study conducts a randomized impact evaluation of anticipatory cash transfers distributed to pastoralist households in Mongolia, where extreme winter conditions cause high livestock mortality and threaten rural livelihoods. We evaluate the effectiveness of cash transfers with an average value of 236 USD to at-risk households amid the extremely severe winter of 2020/21. Specifically, we investigate whether the receipt of one-off cash transfers helped pastoralist households prevent socioeconomic damage by considering their effects on householdsâ€™ assets, income, investments, and consumption."
