abstract: "This study, conducted as a class experiment as a part of EC325 - Experimental Economics at Skidmore College in the fall semester of 2021, investigates the effect that working for a bonus as opposed to simply receiving a bonus has on charitable giving. In addition, the study seeks to determine whether information about the two conditions and charity type affect charitable giving in the study.
