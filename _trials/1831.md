abstract: "Low-income students are substantially less likely than higher-income students to attend a selective university. In part, this is due to inadequate academic preparation. But even among students who are extremely well-prepared for college, there are substantial income differences in the probability of attending a selective institution (Hoxby and Avery 2012). In Michigan, the pattern is similar. While one in five higher-income students attended a university at least as competitive as the University of Michigan, only one in ten similarly-achieving low-income students did so. Previous research has demonstrated that the college choice decisions of high-achieving, low-income students can be affected by an informational intervention (Hoxby and Turner 2013). We test the effect of delivering information about the state flagship, including an early commitment of financial aid, to high-achieving students in Michigan. In the first set of interventions, which ran for four years, we delivered a simplified message of financial aid via a student packet, principal letter and email, and parent letter to student's home addresses and school addresses. In the fifth year, we construct a second treatment arm that varies the language and the promise of financial aid. In the sixth year, we scaled the HAIL treatment to all schools. We randomized the HAIL test-score cutoff by school, evaluating the effects of lowering the test score cutoff. We set two score cutoffs: one low and one high cutoff. A school in the control group had any student above the high cutoff receive a HAIL packet, with students between the low and high cutoff not receiving the intervention. A school in the treatment group had any student with score above the lower cutoff receive a HAIL packet.
In the seventh and eighth years, the treatment arms once again differed from past years. The initial HAIL intervention involved mailings to students, parents, and principals. In these cohorts, all schools were eligible for the HAIL Scholarship. Students in the control group receive the student and parent letters, but not the principal letter, and students in the treatment group receive the full HAIL treatment.
