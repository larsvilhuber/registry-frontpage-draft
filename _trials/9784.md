abstract: "This study investigates the effect of variation in material payoffs on cooperation in experimental one-shot Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD) games. Following Mengel (2018) we vary three payoff indices. Indices of risk and temptation capture the unilateral incentives to defect against defectors and co-operators respectively, while an index of efficiency captures the gains from cooperation. In a previous analysis, we found that risk has no effect on cooperation, temptation reduces cooperation, and efficiency increases cooperation. Here we provide a confirmatory analysis of these results using a between-subjects design that varies payoff parameters in an orthogonal way and where participants will play one one-shot game. "
