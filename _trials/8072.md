abstract: "Artificial Intelligence (AI) outperforms humans in many tasks. However, accumulating evidence suggests AI aversion – a tendency to distrust and thus ignore AI advice, especially among experts. In a two-stage experiment, we test if trained experts are more acceptive of AI advice in forming predictions and are more sensitive to the AI’s incidental performance. Our results will help design algorithms that are better adopted by human decision-makers, and mitigate the biases that experts hold on algorithms. "
