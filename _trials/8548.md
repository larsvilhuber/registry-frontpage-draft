abstract: "This cluster randomized controlled trial aims to understand better the impact of health insurance on 2,000 women and their families in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. This RCT takes place in a Burkinabe microfinance institution (Yikkri), collaborating with a social insurance association (Tond Laafi). The program under study is a health and social protection system aiming at improving access to healthcare for micro-entrepreneurs and their families through health insurance, medico-social accompaniment and preventive health. 
Three-wave surveys evaluate the health behavior, household vulnerability, working status, willingness to pay for health insurance, risk aversion and time preferences of these households, as well as social norms regarding women's access to healthcare and intra-household decision power. In January and February 2020, before the introduction of the health insurance program, a baseline survey was administrated to 2,000 micro-insurance beneficiaries.  In June 2020, a midline (phone-)survey has been implemented on half of the participants to capture the potential impact of the Covid-19 crisis on health, labor and financial behavior. In September 2020, the health insurance program started for half of the sample while the others (control group) will be prevented from subscribing to it. The end-line quantitative and qualitative survey is planned for January and February 2022.
