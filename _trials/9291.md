abstract: "In many situations, information asymmetries arise and influence human behavior. Such cases are widespread in hierarchical work settings. For example, a manager can have more precise knowledge of the value of worker output than the workers themselves do. This information asymmetry may then be carried over to the decisions executed by the manager involving the allocation of resources. If individual contributions are imperfectly known, the allocation of resources, such as compensation, career promotions, and bonus distributions, may be enacted unfairly. For example, in a teamwork setting, with imperfect information on individual performance, one party would have an incentive to take advantage of others' hard work (Chaw et al., 1988). Further underscoring this from an organizational standpoint, such secrecy and unfair behavior can result in a decline in work effort (Nai et al., 2020). If workers know that the reward can be less than their marginal value of effort, this will result in the effort level being inferior. In this project, we aim to address how information asymmetry affects fairness behavior in endowment allocation and worker performance. We plan to test this with an online experiment using a dictator game with joint endowments."
