abstract: "We conduct an online survey-experiment in Poland using online platform opinie.pl among voting-age Poles, in which we present to randomly drawn subsets of survey respondents two different information treatments (leaving a control group without any information treatment). The information treatments are comprised of publicly available information from the Polish independent media. The first treatment informs respondents about the cases of pedophilia in the Catholic Church and the second treatment informs respondents about the relationship between the Catholic Church and the PiS (Law and Justice) party, which is currently in power. We will analyze how these messages of the independent media affect the political support for the ruling party and trust in and adherence to the Catholic Church in Poland. Most importantly, we are interested in how pre-existing convictions (such as religiosity and political conservatism) influence these effects. The survey-experiment will complement analysis that we will conduct using observational municipality-level data, which do not allow studying individual heterogeneity in reacting to information messages beyond the highly criticized method of ecological inference. The survey-experiment will allow us to collect individual-level data suitable to study the heterogenous effects across respondents depending on their individual characteristics, such as prior cultural background (e.g., religiosity), political alignment, and media access.
