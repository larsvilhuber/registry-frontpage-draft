abstract: "Economics students have been shown to behave more in accordance with traditional economic rationality in games; give less to charity; exhibit less honesty; view greed more favorably; and place greater importance on individualism than collectivism.  In this research project, we investigate whether economics instruction impacts students' beliefs about markets and government.  Specifically, students in introductory microeconomics courses (treatment) and introductory biology, chemistry, and physics courses (control) will take a survey designed to measure students' attitudes towards markets and government at the beginning and end of the courses.  This study will be conducted at Barnard College, Skidmore College, and Santa Clara University during the 2019-2020 academic year.  The primary outcome of interest is whether introductory microeconomics courses increase (decrease) support for markets (government) compared to introductory biology, chemistry, and physics courses. This will be determined using a within subject design, comparing each subjects post-course survey results to their pre-course survey results.  Secondary outcomes of interest include (i) whether there are any differences between the treatment and control groups on the pre-course surveys; (ii) whether within-subject differences are correlated with demographic characteristics, e.g., gender, race, or family income; and (iii) whether within-subjects differences are correlated with other observable characteristics, e.g., textbook or instructors' attitudes toward markets and government."
