abstract: "The government of Côte d'Ivoire has committed to expanding educational access through universal basic education for all children ages 6-16. At the same time, a recent policy report estimates that more than a third of children in agricultural households are working in cocoa production (NORC at the University of Chicago, 2020), largely concentrated in rural areas. Educational quality and learning outcomes in Cote d'Ivoire are very low, especially in agricultural regions where poverty is rampant as families rely on cocoa production for income. The lack of quality and relevant education can also push children out of school and into family farming. This community-randomized trial tests a two-pronged approach to address both poverty (unconditional cash transfers) and educational quality improvement (Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL), tested individually and in combination. One hundred and thirty six communities in the Haut-Sassandra and Nawa regions of Côte d'Ivoire are randomly selected for the trial and assigned into one of the four following arms: (i) education only; (ii) unconditional cash transfer only; (iii) education combined with unconditional cash transfer; (iv) control. Primary outcomes include children’s educational outcomes (literacy and numeracy), participation in cocoa labor, and participation in school."
