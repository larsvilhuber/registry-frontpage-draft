abstract: "For many countries and public institutions, efficient tax collection is essential for their existence. Even though their tax codes seem always complete and precise in specifying terms and procedures of tax collections, in reality there often exists space for improvements. In Slovakia, if a property is sold within five years from its acquisition, the Capital gains tax on property (further just “Tax”) should be paid. The Tax should be self-reported by taxpayers in an annual tax report for the year in which the property was sold, which opens space for evasion. 
In this project, we cooperate with the Financial Administration Slovak Republic and aim at increasing the Tax collections by sending informative letters to the potential evaders that remind them of their obligations. We test several text versions of the letter that may improve the rate of response, each appealing to certain personal motivation. To shed light on what type of information motivates people the most, five variations of the letter were created on top of a baseline letter and were combined orthogonally in a 2x4 manner.
