abstract: "The Common Cents Lab and University of Southern California are working with three credit unions to examine the effect of splitting direct deposit paychecks into savings accounts. Participants will be employees of the three credit unions. We will send email messaging to all employees who fit the eligibility criteria and examine the effect of split direct deposit messaging on take-up rates, account balances over time, and subjective measures of financial wellbeing collected via surveys.
