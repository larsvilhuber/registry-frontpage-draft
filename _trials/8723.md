abstract: "Salience theory and Regret Theory predict that choices between two lotteries are driven not only by the marginal distributions of the lotteries, but also by the correlation between the two lotteries. In particular, both theories predict a preference for relative skewness. Our previous work has documented a precisely estimated null effect of relative skewness on non-repeated lottery choices. In a setting in which participants make repeated choices with outcome feedback, we observe a strong tendency to choose lotteries with a negative relative skewness. In this pilot, we explore whether similar choice patterns obtain in a setting in which, instead of outcome feedback on their past choices, individuals receive sample draws from the lotteries they choose from.
