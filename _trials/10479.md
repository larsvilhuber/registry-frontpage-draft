abstract: "We observe experimentally whether relational quality perceived by members of a group affects CPR management. To this aim, we induce first different levels of relational quality in groups through competitive, cooperative and neutral effort tasks, and then let the groups play a repeated CPR. We also aim at understanding the role of communication on perceived relational quality, comparing the effect of communication with the effect of the effort task. "
