abstract: "We look at data acquired during the 2020 applications cycle to Master's programs in Psychology in Israel. The data is obtained from the matching system that governs the market (the Israeli Psychology Master's Match, or IPMM). Starting from 2020, rank-order lists (ROL) were collected both before and after the interviewing period, and we can look at the evolution of preference between these two periods. We show a correlation between being ranked highly by a program and increasing its rank compared to the previously inputted rank. We also link these results with the applicants' responses to a post-match survey regarding their motivation to change their preferences because of the interviews."
