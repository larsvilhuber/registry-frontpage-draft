abstract: "The criteria used to determine who is qualified for higher education and how students are selected among qualified applicants have large and lasting consequences. There are substantial impacts later in life of how much education you take, where you study and what you study. A recurrent political debate in many countries is the fairness of the criteria used to select between applicants. To design a fair admission system one needs to determine what fairness in education is, or should be. An underlying conflict in the debate about the fairness of admission to
education is that different fairness ideals professes different views on which factors individuals should be held accountable for. This study investigates the attitudes towards these factors. "
