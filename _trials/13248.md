abstract: "One of the major threats to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 (“ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030”) is the continued usage of polluting and inefficient cooking systems. In twenty countries across sub-Saharan Africa, over 90 percent of citizens cannot access clean fuels and technologies. Liquefied Petroleum Gas is known to be cleaner and more efficient. In Ghana, despite multiple government-sponsored LPG promotion programs, adoption is declining, particularly in rural areas. The main contributors to the underuse of LPG technology are cost, inaccurate beliefs, and undervaluation of its benefits, plus a lack of knowledge about the environmental and health effects of wood fuel, LPG’s alternative.

The researchers are working with the Ministry of Energy in rural and peri-urban areas of Ghana where free LPG cookstoves are being distributed in 2024. A baseline survey will be conducted with all households. Following the survey, some households will be randomly assigned to receive safety information and environmental and safety education about the use of LPG cookstoves, either targeting the household head (T1) or the primary cook (T2). The remainder of households will be in the control group, and will receive only the free LPG cookstove, with no additional information.

By leveraging this household level randomization, the evaluation will measure the impact of sensitization on the use of LPG cookstoves, including self-reported use rates and the average minutes of LPG cookstove use per week. Secondary outcomes include views of LPG cookstoves, injuries sustained while cooking, and measures of women's role in household decision-making. All outcomes will be measured via an endline survey."
