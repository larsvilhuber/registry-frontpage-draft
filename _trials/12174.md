abstract: "Economic theory and the controllability principle both suggest adjusting performance measures for uncontrollable factors (i.e., exogenous shocks). Field experiments in this regard typically investigate the use of relative performance information. However, adjustments can also be based on exogenous developments such as inflation. To the best of our knowledge, the effect of such adjustments that explicitly correct for influencing factors that are uncontrollable by the actor has not yet been tested in the field with a randomized controlled trial. We will study a setting in a German retail chain where the firm introduces downward adjustments of sales change in the weekly report to make employees aware of the gap between nominal sales change and inflation-adjusted sales change. Therefore, we will randomly assign retail store employees to a control group receiving nominal sales reports that reflect sales without inflation adjustment and a treatment group receiving real sales reports that reflect inflation-adjusted sales. We intend to use this experimental setting to examine the effects on sales performance. In addition, we intend to conduct cross-sectional analyses if we find proxies for varying changes in demand due to inflation."
