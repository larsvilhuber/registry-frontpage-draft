abstract: "The purpose of this study is to test if we can increase female applications to a male-dominated job (warehouse worker) through changes in the job advertisement. We collaborate with a large Swedish food retail firm and the staffing provider hired by the firm to advertise vacant positions. We create two versions of the job advertisement and randomly assign applicants to see one of the two versions."
