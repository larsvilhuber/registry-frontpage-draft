abstract: "We will conduct a natural field experiment in a private tutoring company using a sample of approximately 1,100 to 1,300 parents, organized into around 550 to 650 peer pairs, to examine how peer effects influence Chinese parents’ decisions to invest in extracurricular courses. Our findings will show that while positive social learning significantly increases the willingness to purchase, negative social learning has a much weaker effect. This suggests that parents tend to be more motivated by positive signals from peers than discouraged by negative ones, reflecting an asymmetry in how they form purchase preferences during the social learning process. In contrast, social utility strengthens both the decision to invest and the actual amount spent, highlighting the role of social comparison in shaping parental behavior."
