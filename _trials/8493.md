abstract: "With the aim of reducing energy consumption due to the associated externalities, a number of recently introduced governmental policies concentrate around subsidizing household energy efficiency investments. Yet, it is not well understood why subsidies are effective in increasing the demand for energy efficiency. In addition to decreasing the price, a subsidy expresses policy-makers intention of increasing product demand and socially desirable behavior. Thus, a subsidy may not only affect demand by shifting the budget constraint but also by directly influencing utility. This study uses a framed field experiment with citizens of Mannheim to understand whether there is an additional impact of a subsidy on energy efficiency investments beyond a pure price effect. Results have implications for the cost-effectiveness of energy-saving subsidies. Due to demand response realized from potential non-monetary effects, a subsidy might give more value than the money spent."
