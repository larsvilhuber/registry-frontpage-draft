abstract: "In many recent elections across the globe, the incumbent government has taken actions prior to or on election day to make its defeat very unlikely. We call such elections "managed" (or authoritarian) elections. We aim to understand the determinants of whether and how people vote in managed elections. In such elections, citizens who oppose the incumbent government have mainly two options: They can vote for an opposition candidate to signal their policy preferences to the regime; or they can abstain from voting to reduce the regime's post-election legitimacy. Our research questions are how the salience of these two options affect whether and how people vote in managed elections; and how this effect differs between areas in which the party of the current incumbent prime minister enjoyed strong support in the past and areas in which it did not. We study these questions in the general elections in Bangladesh that are scheduled for December 30, 2018. Given the current political climate, Bangladesh offers an ideal setting for studying voting behavior in managed elections."
