abstract: "We study the implementation of a job recommender system dedicated to the jobseekers at the French Public Employment Service (PES). For each job seeker, the system ranks vacancies according to the job seeker's chances of being hired on them. It is based on a state of the art machine learning (ML) model, based on the very rich data available at the French PES (including textual data and past hires). 

The goal of this study is to implement a large scale beta test of this recommender system. We will set up a randomized controlled trial in which we will expose a set of job seekers to algorithmic recommendations of vacancies and ask them to rate the recommended job ads. 

This experiment will allow us to identify, thanks to job seekers' ratings and applications, the best combination of two vacancy rankings : one of the rankings is based on an expert system that recommends matches based on the fit between the job seekers' search criteria and the characteristics of job postings ; the other one is obtained from the ML model mentionned above. We will also learn about the impact of providing job seekers with information about the ranks of recommended job ads within these two rankings."
