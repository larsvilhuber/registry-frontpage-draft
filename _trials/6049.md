abstract: "The research aims at revealing the perception of young women (and men) about the role of (religious) headscarf for female integration in the public sphere. In particular, it attempts to understand the rationale behind the use of head scarf among young female women in the context of contemporary Muslim society. The hypothesis tested here is that the headscarf is used by young female population to smoothen their transition into the labor market. The particular mechanism we are interested in is to see whether young female women (and men) perceived that wearing this religious garb could help these young females to avoid/compensate the stigma from taking jobs that require them to venture beyond their domestic compound.
