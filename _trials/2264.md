abstract: "Information frictions appear to be pervasive in poor countries (Allen, 2012) and to severely constrain firm and market growth (Jensen, 2012). The goal of the study is to understand information frictions between buyers and suppliers in Liberia. While a lot of procurement tenders are published, it appears that some suppliers have an “information deficit” – e.g., that they lack knowledge about how to apply to tenders or believe that it is not possible for them to win tenders – that leads them to not submit bids. An NGO, Building Markets, runs a training that aims at teaching SMEs how to apply to tenders, and how to maximize their chances of winning. This project will (a) test the impact of the training and (b) seek to understand whether and how information frictions prevent SMEs from taking profitable actions by using different information provided to firms encouraged to get trained."
