abstract: "Conflicts between Fulbe (also known as Fulani) pastoral herders and settled farming communities in Northern Ghana and the wider Sahel have grown more frequent and violent in recent years. While these conflicts are due in part to competition for scarce resources, exacerbated by climate change and increased migration from the Sahel, complex social forces are also at play, escalating conflicts into violence through interactions between and within social networks and key actors. Within this context, the USAID/OTI Littorals Regional Initiative (LRI) will implement a three-pronged intervention to address tensions between Fulbe herders and non-Fulbe farmers in a set of communities across the Upper West region of Norther Ghana: (1) a facilitated dialogue session between farmers and herders; (2) inter-ethnic mediation committees to resolve disputes; and (3) integrated Village Savings and Loans Associations (VSLAs) to increase contact and cooperation between the two groups.

The evaluation of the intervention is conducted as a cluster-randomized control trial in 46 communities across the region, where 23 are assigned to receive all three components of the three-pronged intervention, and 23 are assigned to a control condition. Key outcomes will be: perceptions among Fulbe and non-Fulbe households that disputes are resolved fairly, presence of recent violent conflict, perceived likelihood of future uncompensated crop destruction among non-Fulbe households, and perceived tenure security of Fulbe households. These outcomes are measured through baseline and endline household surveys with both men and women in Fulbe and non-Fulbe households, as well as surveys with community leaders."
