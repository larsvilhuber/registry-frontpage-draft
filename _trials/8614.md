abstract: "Abstract
Administrators’ organizational burnout threatens their leadership roles, and accounts for poor health and professional outcomes, resulting in undermined overall institutional achievements. Burnout in school administrators impacts largely on both the teachers and students, hampering smooth teaching and learning. Coaching may be an invaluable therapeutic approach to building resilience and removing symptoms.  This randomized control trial sought to investigate the effectiveness of GROW-Model (GROW-M) of Cognitive Behavioural Coaching, in minimizing burnout symptoms in a sample of school administrators in South-East Nigeria. Participants included 77 principals and headteachers who volunteered to participate in the study and met the inclusion criteria. In a randomized control trial design, we randomly assigned participants to GROW-M (N=38) and waitlist control (N=39) groups using a simple random sampling technique. A 2-hour GROW-M program was delivered to the GROW-M intervention group weekly for 9 weeks. Maslach Burnout Inventory-Educators’ Survey (MBI-ES) and the School Leaders’ Self-Efficacy Scale (SLSES) were employed to source data at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up evaluations.  Mean, standard deviations, t-test, statistics, repeated measures ANOVA, ANCOVA, Regression analyses, and charts were used to explore data for the study. Results revealed that school administrators’ burnout symptoms reduced significantly at post-test and was sustained through a 3-months follow-up assessment following GROW-M intervention. "
