abstract: "E-commerce continues to grow in importance, but many MSME’s have not invested in their firm’s ability to sell online. This may be due to a lack of know-how (a “supply-side” constraint), or simply due to a lack of perceived benefit for selling online (a “demand-side” constraint). We test the relative importance of these two types of constraints using two randomized evaluations in the country of Georgia. In a first experiment we randomize which firms are offered a training program on how to get their firms online. In a second experiment we offer some firms a
promise that we would make a large purchase from them if we were able to make that purchase online. We will compare the likelihood that firms sell online in the months after our treatment. "
