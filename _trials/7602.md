abstract: "This study seeks to analyse the impact of a Community-Driven Development (CDD) program in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The project sought to strengthen community resilience in the conflict-ravaged eastern part of the country. The CDD program was randomly assigned to about two thirds of 400 communities with eligible project proposals. The selected communities received a budget of up to $100,000 to finance an infrastructure project. Furthermore, the members of each CDD community received training to select and manage the project in an inclusive and participatory way. A random half of CDD communities received a third component, namely the conflict mediation component, which consisted of conflict prevention and management activities, identified and led by NGOs specialized in the matter. According to the theory of change the CDD program would lead not only to improvements in community infrastructure but also to more social cohesion, because of the adopted inclusive and participatory process, and the demonstration effect this entails (when it leads to a successful project implementation). The conflict mitigation component would enhance both of these effects, by reducing internal divisions that could work against the effective implementation of the CDD project. Our impact evaluation puts this theory of change to a test. The outcomes of interest that we will evaluate are situated within two outcome families: access to and quality of infrastructure, and social cohesion."
