abstract: "This project aims at developing an intervention to foster parental book reading and testing its effects on children’s language skills. The intervention targets the parents of 4-year old children attending pre-primary schools in disadvantaged neighbourhoods in the city of Paris. Parents will receive: a) a phone call by an experienced interviewer that will encourage them to participate in this initiative and will explain the benefits of parental reading for their children in terms of cognitive development and educational opportunities; b) one free book to read per week; c) written materials with information on effective reading techniques; d) weekly text messages with tips and suggestions for an enjoyable reading. Widening the vocabulary and narrative discourse skills of children is our main target, but we expect that parental reading initiatives can have long-term, lasting effects only if they raise parents’ and children intrinsic enjoyment of reading.
