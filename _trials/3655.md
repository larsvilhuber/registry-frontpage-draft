abstract: "The Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration (SEED) is the country’s first city-led guaranteed income (GI) pilot. It is a collaboration between the Office of Mayor Michael Tubbs, the Economic Security Project (ESP), and the residents of Stockton. In 2019, SEED will begin providing at least 100 Stocktonians with a GI of 500 USD per month for 18 months. The income will be distributed monthly through prepaid debit cards that will be issued in each recipient’s name. Since the income is “guaranteed,” there are no work requirements or restrictions on how the money can be spent. The project relies on a randomized controlled trial with parallel mixed methods design (QUAN + QUAL) containing quantitative and qualitative research strands anchored by participatory action research (PAR), and informed by evidence-based learning agendas (Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2008; Urban Institute, 2018). The primary research questions are: (1) How does GI impact volatility? (2) To what degree do changes in income volatility alter financial well-being, psychological distress, and physical functioning? (3) How does GI generate agency over one’s future?"
