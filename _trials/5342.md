abstract: "Social networks are recognized to be important for labor market outcomes as job seekers rely upon their networks to find jobs. However, there is limited evidence about specifically what kind of job information flows through networks and how agents choose to disclose information with their connections. This project seeks to investigate these mechanisms through an experiment that varies the availability of job information and skills related to job search among graduating college students in India. We then track how this information flows among student cohorts. "
