abstract: "While women comprise 35% of the STEM workforce, they make up only 13% of inventors; Black professionals represent 9% of STEM workers but only 1.2% of inventors (NCSES, 2023; Akcigit and Goldschlag, 2022). These discrepancies highlight a substantial “innovator-inventor gap,” or the reduced rate at which innovators from underrepresented groups (URGs) become inventors on patents despite their presence in the
STEM workforce (Chien, 2024).  Our proposed field experiment will investigate the influence that proactive outreach has on STEM professionals' engagement with the invention process at a collaborating high-tech firm.  By randomly assigning those who have never submitted an inventive idea for patenting to treatment and control groups, we plan to examine how different framing (opt-in/opt-out) and highlighted factors (extrinsic rewards/intrinsic motives) influence engagement with the inventive process, which we will measure through participation rates in early stages of the process (e.g., attending a brainstorming event) and submitted inventive ideas.  Then, we will evaluate whether opt-out framing reduces the innovator-inventor gap as well as STEM professionals' self-identity as inventors and their perceptions of the firm's innovation culture. Overall, this study will provide experimental evidence on the effectiveness of such interventions in closing gaps within firms and will augment quasi-experimental evidence from natural experiments at four other collaborating firms, which provide evidence consistent with opt-out framing attenuating the innovator-inventor gap."
