abstract: "Using a randomized natural experiment in India, we show that female leadership influences adolescent girls' career aspirations and educational attainment. In an effort to increase women's participation in politics, the constitution was amended in 1993 to require a random third of village council positions to be reserved for women. We conducted surveys with adolescents aged between 11 to 15 and their parents and found that the presence of a female leader in the village: significantly increased parents' aspirations for their daughters, led to a decrease in the gender gap in aspirations - 25% in parents and 32% in adolescents, and led to a reduction in the amount of time girls spent on household chores for two election cycles (1998 and 2003). We found no evidence of changes in young women's labor market opportunities, which suggests that the impact of women leaders has a role model effect."
