abstract: "In the experiment, circa 17-year-old students are given tasks related to grit. The total of 71 students will sail on two three-masted ships for approximately 6 months starting in October 2022. The exercises will be carried out once a week on one of the two ships and will last approximately 20 minutes. They can be carried out independently and at leisure. The students will be interviewed shortly before their voyage and after their return using an online tool."
