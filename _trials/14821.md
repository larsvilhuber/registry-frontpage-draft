abstract: "Studies show that small suggestions can influence an individuals's decision-making and therefore lead them to make more sustainable choices. In this study, we aim to examine whether providing a few tips can help people to reduce their food waste. Many people unintentionally waste food, due to a lack of experience in managing food, especially in single-person households. To investigate this, we plan to conduct an experiment in which participants either receive a flyer with practical tips to raise awareness to reduce food waste or none at all. By comparing the amount of food waste between both groups, we hope to determine whether these tips have a significant impact on food waste reduction."
