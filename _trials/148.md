abstract: "Can raising the aspirations of the poor help them escape poverty? In theory, exogenously raising aspirations could have positive effects by inducing higher effort, but could also reduce effort if higher aspirations lead to failure and frustration. We implement a randomized controlled trial among small entrepreneurs testing the impact of exogenously inducing high financial aspirations. We randomly assign clients of a microfinance institution (MFI) in the Philippines to an aspirations treatment, a financial knowledge treatment, both treatments, or a control group. This research design allows us to compare the aspirations treatment with a more traditional financial knowledge treatment. Primary outcomes of interest are savings and borrowing, self-reported in an endline survey as well as from the MFI's administrative data. We also examine impacts on self-reported business investments and behavioral parameters (present bias and locus of control). "
