abstract: "Research has shown that procrastination has significant adverse effects on individuals, including lower savings and poorer health. Procrastination is typically modeled as resulting from present bias. We study an alternative model of procrastination: excessively optimistic beliefs about future demands on an individual's time. The two models can be distinguished by how individuals respond to information on their past choices. We propose two complementary experiments to test the predictions of the models. If the experimental results refute the hypothesis that present bias is the sole source of dynamic inconsistency, this will have important implications for the large literature on present-biased discounting behavior. Moreover, it will have important practical implications. The findings will offer an explanation, for example, for low takeup of commitment and suggest that personalized information on past choices could instead be an important tool for mitigating procrastination."
