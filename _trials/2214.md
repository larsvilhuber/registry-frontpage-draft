abstract: "This randomized control trial tested the impact of a school-only (SO) approach versus a life-wide learning (LWL) approach to supporting early primary grade learning in rural Rwanda. Schools in SO and LWL conditions received reading materials and teacher training. In addition, LWL villages received training and materials to enrich home and community literacy ecologies. Reading assessments administered to 1668 Primary 1 students in 2013 and again two years later showed that both treatments had positive impacts on learning; LWL produced greater impact. However, nearly one-third of students across all groups could not read at the end of the study, indicating that there is still significant work to do to ensure learning for all."
