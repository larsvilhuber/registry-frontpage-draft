abstract: "Research has documented positive effects of doctor-patient race concordance, suggesting that increasing diversity among healthcare professionals may play an important role in addressing well-documented racial health disparities in the US. It also remains critical to improve the quality of interactions in race discordant doctor-patient relationships. However, as we consider policies to increase the number of minority healthcare professionals, especially among doctors, questions about the equilibrium effects of such initiatives naturally emerge. In this project, we examine whether and how patients vary their perceptions of healthcare professionals by race. Significant variation in the perceived quality of minority healthcare professionals could adversely affect the quality and effectiveness of healthcare interactions involving these professionals. Moreover, the range of potential negative patient attitudes that could be encountered in day-to-day clinical practice may also be considered an anticipatory tax and another barrier for prospective minority trainees.
