abstract: "This project investigates how individual preferences and attitudes shape welfare chauvinistic attitudes among UK voters. 
The study measures participants' welfare dependency, inequality acceptance, racist inclinations, and a wide range of demographic characteristics. 
We test whether (1) increased welfare dependency, (2) racist inclinations, (3) and higher inequality acceptance are positively associated with welfare chauvinism. "
