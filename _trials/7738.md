abstract: "We describe the analysis plan for a lab-in-the-field study that will examine the effects of unconditional cash transfers on childrenâ€™s social preferences. The study will be conducted with children living in Nakuru County, Kenya whose parents participated in a previously implemented RCT that provided cash transfers to poor households. Participating households either received a cash transfer, did not receive a transfer but lived in the same village as those who did, or did not receive a transfer and lived in a village in which nobody received a transfer. Participants will be surveyed and will complete several standard economic games measuring their social preferences. For these tasks, they will be paired with individuals of varying relative wealth to assess their social preferences and how social preferences vary with the identity of the other player. We outline the study design, the outcomes of interest, and the econometric strategy for the analysis."
