abstract: "I investigate in an experimental survey, whether publicly informing individuals from disadvantaged groups that their selection for a beneficial opportunity, such as an educational program, is based on their group identity, aﬀects their perceptions about the support they can receive from university faculty to participate in the program. In a lab-in-the-field experiment in collaboration with a Colombian university, I present information of the international program to students from diﬀerent social groups and ask them to indicate the support they would get from faculty at their university if they required an endorsement from them to register to the program. Some are shown a course invitation and endorsement message that discloses that they would be invited to the program because of their demographics, others are not. "
