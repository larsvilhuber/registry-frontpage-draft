abstract: "Individuals need to work under various forms of distractions in modern educational and professional settings. Some distractions require individuals to multitask, like phone calls and some distractions do not require a response, like workplace noises. We aim to use a lab experiment to measure the effect of different types of distractions on productivity, to study heterogeneity in handling distractions, and to elicit willingness to pay to avoid being distracted.
