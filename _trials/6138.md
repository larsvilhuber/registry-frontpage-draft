abstract: "Survey response rates are often low. To encourage survey completion, participants are sometimes offered financial incentives. In a survey of small business owners, this project explores the impact of incentives on survey responses. Business owners will be offered one of four treatments: (1) in the control group, business owners will receive a message encouraging them to complete the survey; (2) in the gift treatment, business owners will receive a similar message and will also be offered a gift card prior to starting the survey with no conditions attached; (3) in the incentives treatment ($25), business owners will be offered a similar message and also a gift card of the same dollar amount, but to be paid after survey completion (and conditional on completing the full survey); (4) the large incentives treatment ($50) is the same as (3) but with $50 instead of $25. We will analyze the survey response rates and survey completion rates under each condition, as well as the characteristics of businesses responding under each condition.  We will also investigate messaging effects for repeat users in a panel survey and new users who are being recruited to join a panel.  The experiment uses a partially adaptive design.  "
