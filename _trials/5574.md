abstract: "Attracting high-skilled individuals is one of the most important aspects of cities' regional development strategies. While some policies aim at attracting firms to increase the local demand for high-skilled labour, others aim to directly raise high-skilled labour supply by attracting high skilled individuals with better local amenities. Empirically, cities with better cultural offerings or greater perceived openness indeed tend to have a higher share of high-skilled people. However, the effectiveness of these policies that are focused on amenities are hotly debated, as it is not clear whether people follow amenities or amenities follow people. 
Therefore we use a stated-preference choice experiment to study how individuals value local amenities in their relocation decisions between different cities. In this experiment, we pose a variety of randomized choices between job offers in two hypothetical cities to a representative sample of the German working population. Each of the choice scenario consists of two alternatives specifying a combination of earnings and the quality of different amenities. Our main focus in the analysis of these choices will be on the respondents' willingness to forego higher wages for better local amenities: Which amenities are more relevant for the relocation choice? Does the measured implicit willingness to pay for different types of urban amenities vary between different groups of respondents? Are preferences different between high-skilled and less-skilled individuals?
