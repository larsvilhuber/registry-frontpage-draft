abstract: "How does social identity affect career choices? Why do men not apply to jobs traditionally dominated by women? While there is a rich and growing literature on stereotypes and aspirations, there are a few studies investigating how counter-stereotypical messages in crucial moments of choice can actually induce more people to consider and even pursue a career which is uncommon for their group of origin. 
I design an experiment in collaboration with a UK organization operating in a sector traditionally made of more than 75% of women. The experiment randomly assigns people interested in applying to the organization in different treatment groups, which manipulate the content of an invitation-to-apply email. The different treatments are meant to investigate the extent to which social identity matters for this career choice and disentangle some of the channels through which it affects decisions at different stages of the recruitment and selection process, for different demographic groups. The main outcome variables will be information gathering about the job, application submission and performance in the selection process, offer acceptance, performance on the job. I will also validate the mechanisms behind the intervention in an additional online experiment with a different sample."
