abstract: "Women form 3/4th of India's weavers but they are primarily engaged in activities lower in the weaving value chain that are characterized by low returns and drudgery. This study examines the impact of a project that aims to collectivise women weavers into producer enterprises, thereby moving them from being wage earners to owners. After collectivisation, women will be provided trainings on advanced weaving technology and business management. The project will set up common weaving facilities and link women weavers to urban and global value chains and markets. Using village-level randomisation, we examine the impact of of the project over 2 years. "
