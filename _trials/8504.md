abstract: "Dockless bike-sharing is popular and provides the commuting service for "the last mile of trip". Hellobike company also taps over 450 university markets, where some shared bicycles only serve students and exclusively circulate on university campuses. In this study, we design different treatments that vary in the extent to which they appeal to usersâ€™s considerations for other users, to test the role of social preferences in bike-sharing. In a field experiment, we design four treatments: social norms, individual free-ticket, group free-ticket, and feedbacks."
