abstract: "Estimates suggest that 250 million children under 5-years of age in low- and middle-income countries are at risk of not reaching their developmental potential (Lu, Black, & Richter, 2016). Compared to other regions, sub-Saharan Africa has the highest prevalence of children at risk, with 38% of the 143 million children younger than 5 stunted and 50% living in extreme poverty (Lu et al., 2016). Early childhood
education (ECE) can support child development; estimates suggest that the benefit–cost ratio of increasing ECE access in LMICs is considerable (Engle et al., 2011). Whether ECE targeted to the most vulnerable girls in a community can reduce gender inequalities is not known. Northern Nigeria has some of the world’s highest rates of child marriage and maternal mortality and lowest rates of female literacy. The most vulnerable girls in a rural northern Nigerian community are often those who have never even enrolled in school. The present study is a partnership between the Centre for Girls Education and academic researchers. Using a matched-pair mixed methods community-randomized trial, we test the impacts of a high-quality, Montessori-based ECE program for vulnerable girls on schooling and learning outcomes in the short- and medium-term, and on parental investments in girls’ education."
