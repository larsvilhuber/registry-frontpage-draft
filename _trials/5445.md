abstract: "As part of the Ghana Tilapia Seed Project (2019-2022), a cluster randomized experiment is being planned to test the impact of aquaculture training provision among small-scale tilapia pond farmers in 4 major tilapia producing regions in Ghana.The intervention is the provision of information to farmers. This is combined practical face-to-face training + access to mobile app. Information to be provided in mainly on good aquaculture practices.

To minimize risk of contamination, the unit of randomization will be clusters (that is, districts). Due to small sample size and few geographical locations, we plan to use to pair-matching method first and then randomization (that is,  assigning randomly 1 to the treatment group and the other to the control group). We produced 19 district pairs based on cluster size (number of active tilapia farmers in each district) and region. In each pair, we randomly assigned 1 in the Treatment and the other in the Control group based on a lottery among the research team.
