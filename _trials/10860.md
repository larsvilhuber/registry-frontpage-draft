abstract: "This study evaluates the impact of a change in the school feeding model from centrally procured date bars to a community-based kitchen healthy meal model in Jordan. This impact evaluation (IE) uses a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design to investigate the impacts of the change in meal composition on children's nutrition and learning outcomes. It also investigates the impacts of the change in the procurement model on service delivery and kitchen workersâ€™ employment opportunities and income. To shed light on the mechanisms through which realised impacts occur, the study will analyze the heterogeneity of impacts based on gender and other socioeconomic characteristics using administrative data, in-person worker and worker household surveys, and student surveys and tests.
