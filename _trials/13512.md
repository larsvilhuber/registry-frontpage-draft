abstract: "This study examines the impact of an information intervention on parental leave uptake for mothers and fathers. The study employs a survey experiment in which participants are randomly assigned, with equal probability, to either the information group or the no-information group. The information group receives details on the positive impact of taking paternity leave on child and couple-related outcomes. The study investigates: (i) whether the information increases the intention to use parental leave for fathers; (ii) whether the information alters the gender division in the length of parental leave that mother and fathers intend to take; (iii) whether the information alters mothers’ preferences for their partners to take parental leave; and (iv) whether these effects vary according to within-couple differences in gender norms and time use."
