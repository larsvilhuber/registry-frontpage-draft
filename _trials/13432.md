abstract: "We use a lab-in-the-field experiment to assess the common human resource policy that awards prioritiziation of female employees in evaluations and promotions (implemented as additional points in an evaluation form). We test whether the policy is effective in increase female employees' evaluations (i.e., higher total score), and whether male employees are evaluated more highly in sub-categories as response to the policy (i.e., higher scores on the factors that contribute to the total score)."
