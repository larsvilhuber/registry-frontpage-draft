abstract: "Why do citizens in need leave money on the table by failing to claim valuable government benefits designed to assist them? Past research has indicated that low take-up rates for benefits may be due to a lack of awareness combined with the real or perceived complexity (and cognitive costs) associated with the process of claiming benefits. We test these explanations in a large-scale field experiment involving a sample of 250,000 individuals potentially eligible for a substantial government benefit they have not yet claimed. Using a digital application, we will notify a randomly selected group of individuals that they may be eligible for a government benefit they have not yet claimed, and then provide a sub-sample of those who respond with a simplified approach to claiming the benefit. We will assess the impact of the the notification and simplification interventions on rates of claiming.
