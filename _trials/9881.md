abstract: "Residential sorting across socio-economic strata translates into students being exposed to higher levels of air pollution if they belong to lower socio-economic strata. Since there is evidence that pollution lowers cognitive ability, this could reduce learning, educational attainment, and 
eventually salaries for disadvantaged students. Governments could minimize pollution exposure by installing filters that improve classroom air quality. This project aims to experimentally evaluate whether installing air filters inside classrooms enhances student learning. Bogot√°'s high levels of air pollution are likely negatively affecting the education of boys and girls in public (and private) schools. Installing air filters (HEPA) can mitigate the harmful effects of pollution and improve student performance. All in all, our project asks: what are the effects of installing air filters inside classrooms on student learning?"
