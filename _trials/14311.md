abstract: "In this trial, we hope to study human preferences with how they collaborate with Generative AI tools in performing writing tasks. The study will be posted as a survey on online platforms, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk and Prolific. We will be varying the nature of the task and level of difficulty and observe how they affect the collaboration mode that humans choose to work with AI. "
