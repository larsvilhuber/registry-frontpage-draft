abstract: "We plan to investigate how information about the debt-to-GDP ratio affects public concerns and support for fiscal policies. To this end, we devise randomized experiments in a representative online survey of the Japanese population. In this article, we describe our plan for the analysis, including the experimental design, the main specifications of our econometric analysis, and corrections for multiple hypothesis testing."
