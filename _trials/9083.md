abstract: "West Africa remains a region where maternal and newborn diseases remain the primary causes of preventable deaths. While resources are scarce, evidence suggests that preventative and curative measures are under-utilized. This research studies a central, though sometimes overlooked factor in maternal and child health decisions: traditional beliefs, which have been shown to be high among general populations within Africa (Pew Research Center, 2010) and present around the world (Singh, 2021). We utilize a randomized controlled trial to study the impact of a novel type of health campaign which brings together modern and traditional health workers in rural villages in Guinea-Bissau. By comparing the impact of this campaign to that of a standard campaign, and to a control group of villages, we are able to assess how traditional beliefs interact with the potential success of these different campaigns.
