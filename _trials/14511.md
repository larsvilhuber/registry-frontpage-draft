abstract: "Organizations frequently adopt quotas in their selection processes to redress imbalances between majority and minority groups. While the literature has found positive quota effects on workforce composition in the short run, the long-term consequences for team performance, career advancement, and tenure remain ambiguous. Workplace interactions are likely to sway the latter outcomes. Recent studies have revealed variations in engagement in teamwork across groups, particularly between genders, and linked these disparities to confidence. However, there is a knowledge gap on the impact of quotas on confidence and team interactions. I conduct a laboratory experiment comprising a tournament and a teamwork stage. Participants are randomly sorted into a control and a quota group. The tournament's performance determines pair compositions and payment schemes for the subsequent teamwork stage. I measure the impact of quota on confidence, team performance, and willingness to work as a team. By exposing participants to their teammates' confidence, I investigate the presence of learning biases in quota-generated exposure."
