abstract: "Coffee is a major cash crop and source of income for thousands of smallholder farmers in Uganda. High quality Arabica coffee is highly demanded in the international market and, thus, has high income generation potential across the value chain including for primary producers. However, the quality of Arabica coffee grown in Uganda is persistently low. A key cause identified is poor harvesting and marketing among smallholder coffee producers. World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) implements a program in collaboration with the largest coffee exporter in the area to encourage adoption of quality- and market-improving practices. An extension meeting which focuses on improved quality and the importance of marketing coffee is held. This project analyzes the role of information dissemination and estimates the effect of the information in encouraging improving quality and market to increase revenues for smallholder farmers. There are 3 treatment variations. First treatment variation is provision of information on coffee quality and harvest in addition to improving market through selling coffee to the largest exporter area to access certified coffee markets. Information is provided by an extension worker. The second experimental variation focuses on peer social learning. In addition to the extension worker, a peer farmer who uses improved harvest practices is invited to training session to share his/her positive experience about the practice, answer questions, and encourage others for adoption. Lastly, in the third variation, a market actor (the project manager of the largest coffee exporter in the region) attends extension meetings briefly and talks about the importance of coffee quality and selling to the exporter to accessing certified coffee markets. 

EDIT: the second treatment variation could not be implemented."
