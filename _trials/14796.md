abstract: "We run a randomized control trial on mortgage customers of a large German bank we collaborate with. Our objective is to understand existing awareness about the recent increase in mortgage rates and its accompanying effect on payments, as well as how awareness affects mortgagorsâ€™ beliefs and choices. The bank sends an official letter designed by us to a random set of mortgage customers. The letter comprises four sections. First, we describe how mortgage rates in Germany have increased since 2022. Second, we explain future mortgage rates are uncertain. Third, we highlight how an increase in mortgage rates can feed into monthly payments. Fourth, we list options to cope with higher mortgage rates. We randomly vary the sections shown in the letter across respondents to pinpoint drivers of possible letter effects. 

We investigate effects of the letter provision in both survey and bank data. We run a customized survey around three weeks after the letter distribution. The survey allows us to measure attention paid to the letter directly, as well as letter effects on beliefs (such as interest-rate perceptions) and self-reported past and planned mortgage choices. In the bank data, we can test for observed choices post-treatment, such as meetings with bank advisors, mortgage repayments, and changes in spending/saving behavior. 

The survey also comprises a hypothetical vignette in which respondents make choices based on a mortgage that needs refinancing in the future. We primarily ask respondents about whether they would interact with a bank advisor and would consider mortgage prepayments, as well as the reasoning behind their choices. The vignette section also includes questions on information acquisition, the rate-fixation period, propensity to lock in future rates, and saving and mortgage-search behavior. We vary the hypothetical size of the mortgage-rate change as well as the time until refinancing as part of the vignette, allowing us to study the sensitivity of choices to changes in the size of the rate increase and in the distance to refinancing.
