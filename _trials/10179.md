abstract: "In this project, we study how changes in a social context, defined as the group composition of a society, affect prosocial behavior among members of that society. The project conducts an experiment that examines how making society more or less familiar to an individual, changes her redistributive allocations towards others. Moreover, we provide evidence of perceived closeness between individuals as the mechanism through which social context affects decisions."
