abstract: "A student’s performance on a test is highly correlated with the time and effort exerted in preparation prior to the test. But even with similar preparation levels, some outperform others. Among other factors, this may be attributed to students’ differential intrinsic motivation affecting their effort exerted during the test per se. Gneezy et. al (2019) showed that the low intrinsic motivation during a test could be mitigated by offering pecuniary incentives tied to student’s performance on the test. Our paper extends this literature and studies the effectiveness of a subtler zero-cost behavioral nudge in increasing students’ effort during a test. More specifically, we study how varying the saliency of maximum points affects students’ exerted effort and performance during the test. We study this question in two contexts: (a) High stake quiz for microeconomics course, and (b) Zero-stake aptitude test conducted for students persuing communication course at the university. "
