abstract: "This trial assesses the impact of an intervention aimed at improving demand for and access to early childcare services (ECS) in France. The literature reports that attendance of high-quality ECS has positive effects both on women’s employment and on children’s development and school achievement, more so for children of low socioeconomic status (SES) families. However, these children are strongly underrepresented in ECS. 
We hypothesize that structural barriers relating to the accessibility of ECS (rationing of places and criteria of access) and to their costs for the families only partly explain the lower demand for and access of low-SES families. Relying on a qualitative preparatory study, we expect that a lack of information about these services as well as administrative barriers in the application process contribute to unequal access. Therefore, we designed an intervention targeting pregnant mothers and delivering information and support about the availability, costs, eligibility criteria of ECS and the related application procedures. We will contact mothers during their prenatal visits to maternity wards of hospitals in the metropolitan area of Paris (Ile de France) and administer a baseline questionnaire to collect information on socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge of ECS, and intentions to use them. After this interview, they will be randomly assigned to three experimental arms (control, information-only treatment, information plus administrative support treatment). One year later we will administer a phone interview on actual recourse and two years later a follow-up to measure long-term impacts on children’s development."
