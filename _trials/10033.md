abstract: "Why do people stay put and do not seek better jobs? Is it because they think the gains from changing jobs are small or because they believe the costs of looking for a new job are high? What are the main costs and obstacles people face in their job search process? Are search costs especially high for certain groups of workers? In this project I study how search costs and beliefs about outside options affect the job mobility decisions of employed workers. I design and field a new survey in the U.S. to measure directly the costs associated to the job search process (time, money, stress), and elicit employed workers’ beliefs about their opportunities outside of their current job. I correlate beliefs and search costs with respondents’ past, present, and future intended job search behavior. I exogenously shift respondents’ beliefs on outside options and on search costs using two information experiments, and I study the effect of the treatments on job search intention. "
