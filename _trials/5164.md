abstract: "As social protection cash transfer programs expand, they face demands to deliver greater public value as well as increase cost-effectiveness. There is evidence that insights from behavioral science- the science of how humans make decisions and take actions- can be used to achieve these objectives. Ongoing partnerships between ideas42, the World Bank, and the governments of Kenya ad Tanzania have been working to enhance the effectiveness of cash transfer programs through a process of design, testing, and analysis. Research from the field of behavioral science along with a process of user-testing and iteration were used to design context-specific packages of interventions to increase the cost effectiveness of such cash transfer programs. The upcoming RCT will survey about 2880 individuals in 64 sites in Kenya and 64 sites in Tanzania at baseline and again 6 months later during a follow-up to estimate if light-touch, low-cost interventions can improve short-term outcomes that may lead to more productive investments and better economic well-being in the long term."
