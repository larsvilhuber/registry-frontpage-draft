abstract: "Do election monitors influence views of elections?  In Cote d’Ivoire I will test this question using the past election held on October 31, 2020 to see how the views of international election monitors influence the views of Ivorian citizens about the election one year later.  Following Benstead et al. (2020), I test if the statements of international election monitors had an effect on views of the electorate.  For this analysis, I will use a relatively positive statement about the election, a negative statement, and a control which provides no statement positive or negative about the election.  Statements about the election come from those made by elections monitors following the election.  The statements about the elections and control will be randomized across randomly selected respondents in Abidjan and Grand Bassam.  In addition to examining views of the past election, I will also test to see if statements by election monitors influences views about monitoring in the future, and democracy more generally.  "
