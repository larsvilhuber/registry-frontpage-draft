abstract: "Early-life skills acquisition is a strong predictor of later life outcomes such as education and income, even in Denmark with highly subsidized childcare and free education. Parents play an instrumental role in their children’s acquisition of skills, but research suggests that parents from different socioeconomic backgrounds invest differently in their children. Consequentially, substantial skills gaps emerge between children from different family backgrounds already at an early age, and research suggests that these gaps can be difficult to close at later ages. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of a low-cost way to reduce the early skills gaps: by sending text messages directly to parents of preschool children with tips about how to incorporate simple language stimulation exercises into their busy everyday lives. The text messages are designed to eliminate some of the behavioral barriers to active language stimulation: lack of information, cognitive load, and discounting of future rewards. The intervention was originally developed by American researchers at Stanford University and has been adapted to the Danish context. The evaluation is designed as an RCT with a total of 3,181 families across five municipalities in Denmark."
