abstract: "This paper studies how donors respond to merit and need when giving to families facing unaffordable medical expenses. With data from a leading Chinese crowdfunding platform, I find that campaigns receive more donations if fundraisers report attending higher-ranked colleges. By controlling for textual characteristics and exploiting within-donor variation at the transaction level, I show that donors favor patients who attend better colleges, and moderately favor ill family members of a college-attending fundraiser. In line with the donor's limited information about college rank, the residual rank effect is more pronounced for the top institutions and is muted for out-of-province ones.

I design an online RCT to elicit respondentsâ€™ willingness to donate to 20 synthetic fundraising stories. The college tier of the patients and requested donation amounts will be independently randomized. Incentives a la Kessler et al. (2019) will be provided to ensure truthful reporting. I expect respondents with better knowledge of college ranking would be more responsive to patients' college attendance.
