abstract: "We investigate decision making processes under risk and over time of a large rural sample in Karnataka, India. We use a budget line task as used in Choi et al. (2007) and Choi et al. (2014), with visual displazs designed to facilitate understanding of the tasks. This allows us to study rationality in decision making under risk in addition of risk preferences per se. We further combine the incentivised experimental tasks with surveys capturing the socio-economic and socio-demographic characteristics of households."
