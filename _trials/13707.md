abstract: "This is the pre-analysis plan for a survey experiment on the motivations to offer video consultations of German ambulatory care physicians. The experiment consists of three stages. 1) An information treatment that provides a nudge which is supposed to increase the rate of physicians that offer video consulations, 2) a vigniette experiment to determine the importance of different dimensions in the choice to offer video consultations and 3) a multi-armed-bandit study where invitation characteristics are varied to identify the best strategy for researchers
to survey physicians."
