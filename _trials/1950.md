abstract: "A host of contextual factors increase adolescent girls' risk for premature school leaving and subsequent HIV infection in Zambia and evidence suggests that female education, particularly secondary school, may act as a "social vaccine" to prevent the spread of HIV. The primary aim of this project is to determine through a randomized evaluation design whether an e-reader intervention embedded in a safe space platform with a community engagement component will bolster literacy skills among adolescent girls, enhance critical thinking skills, improve results on the Grade 7 Composite Exam, and increase progression to secondary school.
