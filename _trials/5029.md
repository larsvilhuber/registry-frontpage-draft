abstract: "We are studying the impact of small loans on the welfare of loan applicants. Through a partnership with a financial institution operating in Nigeria, a subset of new loan applicants are randomly assigned to different groups, which creates random variation in the likelihood a borrower is approved for a loan, and the value of the loan they are approved for. Between 4-20 weeks after the initial loan application, a phone survey is conducted with each subject that measures several different aspects of welfare. We are interested in estimating average and heterogeneous treatment effects of these loans."
