abstract: "In this trial, we explore whether academic research influences policy decision-making in the traditionally change-resistant domain of public security and crime policies. In our design, we promote information pertaining to policies designed to reduce violence against women. More specifically, we study how the provision of i) evidence about the effect size of those policies; ii) information about the practical know-how on to implement these policies; and iii) support to apply for funding for those policies affect beliefs and take-up in the real world. To achieve this, we promote two randomly selected policies from a set of six across all municipalities in Colombia as they design and implement their municipal security plans. This approach enables us to observe the impact on both beliefs and government plans."
