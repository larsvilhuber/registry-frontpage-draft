abstract: "This document lays out the research design and analysis plan for evaluating the impact of a program that aims to improve the mental health of forcibly displaced women and their children under 2 years. Through a home-based counseling program, Rohingya refugee women, residing in refugee camps in Bangladesh, are counseled weekly on mental health and child-rearing issues. The primary aim is to help them and their children overcome conflict and displacement induced trauma and depression. We evaluate the effect of this program using a cluster randomized control trial. The intervention began in early November 2019 and is scheduled to run for 60 weeks."
