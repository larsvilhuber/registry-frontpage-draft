abstract: "Experimenter demand effects pose an important challenge to understand and interpret results from laboratory and field studies. In this paper, we manipulate participants’ beliefs about the intentions and desires of the experimenters. In particular, we are interested in how far people’s behavior in economic games is elastic to experimenter demand. In our experiment, people are randomly assigned to play either a dictator game, an investment game or to complete a convex time budget. We randomly assign whether people will be exposed to positive, negative or no experimenter demand and whether the choices involve real money or are hypothetical. "
