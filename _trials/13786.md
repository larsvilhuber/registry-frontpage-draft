abstract: "Entrepreneurs in developing countries vary widely in their ability to use grant or loan financing to increase their businesses’ growth; often, only a small group are successful at doing so (Meager, 2022; Meager, 2019). This suggests substantial scope to increase targeting precision of credit and loan programs for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). In spite of this, rigorous screening processes and sophisticated statistical models have not been very predictive of high-growth businesses in such programs (McKenzie and Sansone, 2019; Fafchamps & Woodruff. 2017). Recent research, however, points to a promising possibility of using information in the community to predict which entrepreneurs and firms have high returns to capital (Hussam, Rigol, and Roth, 2022). We extend this literature by leveraging a randomized control trial in a large-scale business support program implemented in Ghana to explore whether valuable information exists within the networks of entrepreneurs who own small firms (sized 6-30 employees), including peers and other stakeholders such as suppliers and customers. We examine their ability to predict marginal returns not only to capital but also managerial consulting and a peer learning intervention, and entrepreneurs’ future outcomes. For these market participants, we also examine the accuracy of predictions when resource allocations are at stake and explore the extent to which two simple tools from mechanism design can address potential strategic misreporting."
