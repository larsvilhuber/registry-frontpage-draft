abstract: "In 2015 and 2016, over 1.2 million refugees arrived in Germany, the large majority without knowing the German language or possessing any formal or vocational degrees. The task to integrate them in the German society is further complicated by the fact that being subject to an often lengthy asylum procedure and constant assistance by government social workers and volunteers tends to decrease the refugees' self-initiative and their belief to be able to shape their own future. This study examines whether introducing an active and activating case management can counter this development and foster the integration of refugees. To identify its impact, we implement a field experiment at the roll-out of a local "integration management" program in a medium-sized German city. About 620 household heads and their family members are randomly allocated to treatment and control group, with treatment meaning working with the integration managers for eight months, while those in the control group continue to be cared for by traditional social workers throughout this period and are taken into the integration management afterwards. The short-term impact is measured as the difference in relevant integration variables after the eight months treatment period. Additionally, we intent to disentangle potential channels of influence (more intensive assistance due to a lower refugees-per-integration-manager ratio vs. more structured and activating approach)."
