abstract: "We explore the relationship between political donations and the allocation of public procurement contracts across multiple local elections in Colombia. By linking the universe of public contractors and the mandatory report of political donations by individuals and firms, our results demonstrate a long-term distortion in the contract allocation process attributable to political donations. We then introduce a novel experimental approach, to study how new mayors strategically react to different warnings about increased scrutiny of contracts given to their donors. "
