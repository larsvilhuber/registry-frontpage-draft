abstract: "There is a wide range of literature that shows the strong relationship between goal setting and performance. In this study, this relationship is investigated even further by conducting a field experiment with continuous treatment of goal setting. We study whether goals should be assigned to people based on their personal traits (such as ability, self-efficacy, etc.) to attain an even higher performance increase than in the case of a pre-defined general goal of high difficulty. Moreover, we study whether the relationship between goal difficulty and performance has curvilinear (inverse-U) shape.
