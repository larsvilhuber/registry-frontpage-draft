abstract: "Social influence is a key factor in shaping individuals' behavior across various domains of life. The purpose of this research project is to investigate how individuals anticipate and respond to social influences in various settings, with a focus on effort provision and working time. This research will not only enhance our understanding of human behavior, but also provide valuable insights for policymakers and organizations seeking to design environments that promote optimal decision making and to regulators overseeing organizations that may exploit the social naiveté of their members, employees, or customers."
