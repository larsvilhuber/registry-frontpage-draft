abstract: "This project focuses on electoral promises and their impacts in municipal elections of the Philippines.  The core of the project - conducted in collaboration with the Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting - relies on conducting an informational treatment in the context of the 2016 mayoral elections in the Ilocos Sur and Ilocos Norte regions of the country. We followed a similar approach in trial AEARCTR-0000688 which studied the 2013 elections, research upon which this project builds.  Voters in randomly selected villages will receive information on the promises of candidates running in the 2016 elections and a random subset of them will also be reminded of the promises made by candidates ahead of the 2013 elections. 

The project seeks to answer questions such as:
1.       What are the effects of repeated promises on voter and candidate behavior, including vote buying?
2.       How does incumbent compliance with past promises influence voter reactions to new promises?
3.       How do promises and their effects vary with the strength of incumbents?

We will also estimate key parameters of a structural model of vote choice based on elicitation of voters beliefs and heterogenous preferences for policy. In addition, we will be able to run some counterfactual simulations, including, but not limited to: 
1.       What would have happened to the elections without electoral promises? 
2.       What would have happened to the elections without vote buying?
3.       What would have been the effects of the intervention if candidates were unable to buy votes?
