abstract: "Measuring program impacts on child mortality requires large sample sizes.  Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on water treatment are therefore typically designed and powered only to detect effects on the more common intermediate outcome of caregiver reported diarrhea, which may or may not be a good proxy for water-related mortality. In this paper, we increase statistical power for examining the child survival effect of improved water quality by conducting a meta-analysis. To address the possibility that researchers are more likely to report child survival findings if estimates are positive, we systematically contact the authors of all RCTs on water interventions in the developing world to find studies with data on mortality outcomes.
