abstract: "Youth unemployment is a pressing concern in Sub-Saharan Africa, including in Tanzania. This challenge is exacerbated by the lack of preparedness of school leavers for the job market. We test a podcast intervention aiming to enhance youth work readiness in secondary schools. Teachers will be trained to deliver this content in the last year of lower secondary school, combining teacher support, new teaching materials, and aspirational edutainment.

The study aims to assess the program's effectiveness and its impact on labor market outcomes while exploring the underlying mechanisms. This pre-analysis plan is for the endline evaluation, focusing on impacts on student economic trajectories after they have left school.
