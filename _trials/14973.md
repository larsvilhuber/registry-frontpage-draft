abstract: "According to a recent report by Oxfam (India Inequality Report 2022), only a third of the women in India own a mobile phone, whereas for men the ownership rate is over 60%. This wide gender gap in mobile phone usage is a matter of great concern as owning a mobile phone is identified to be pivotal to promoting the empowerment of women by the United Nations under target 5.b of its fifth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG-5). This project aims to study the causal effect of providing smartphones and training interventions on women empowerment. "
