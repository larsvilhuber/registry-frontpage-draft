abstract: "We use the three-games design of Cox (2004) to identify the mechanisms behind first- and second-mover behavior in indirect reciprocity. We first look at upstream reciprocity, where Player X helps Player Y, and therefore Player Y helps Player Z. We aim to disentangle pure other-regarding preferences from strategic considerations in Player X's behavior, and other-regarding preferences from wanting to reciprocate a kind action in Player Y's behavior.
