abstract: "Joint-liability groups and rigid repayment schedules have long been considered essential for guaranteeing high repayment rates in microcredit lending, since they offer mutual insurance and keep repayment discipline high. Yet both features have been criticized lately: rigid repayment schedules interfere with fluctuating incomes, and joint liability induces excessive peer pressure, as group members internalize the mission indoctrination of the microlender. Anecdotal evidence suggests that members who miss one installment due to a shock often do not dare to return to the group at all.  We study whether the interaction of both flexible repayment features and joint-liability allows reaping the benefits of joint liability and flexibility - high repayment and shock coping capacity - while keeping their downsides - low repayment morale and excessive peer pressure - at bay. To this end, we conduct lab-in-the-field experiments with microcredit borrowers in the Philippines, where we systematically vary the liability structure and flexible repayment features. Outcome measures include repayment behaviour as well as a novel, behavioural measure of peer pressure and anti-social punishment."
