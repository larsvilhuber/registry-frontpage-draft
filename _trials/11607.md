abstract: "This project explores a principal-agent setting where the agent can exert costly effort to improve the likelihood of success for the principal. The principal then has the opportunity to punish the agent. The agent cannot, however, guarantee the outcome for the principal. There are always states of the world outside of the agent's control where the principal wins or loses regardless of the agent's effort level. Under two different treatments, these states of the world are presented in different ways. This project measures the effect of their presentation on effort and punishment. This project also measures how outcomes in the principal-agent interaction affect perceptions of agents in other domains.
