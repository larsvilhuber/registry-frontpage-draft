abstract: "This project studies the effect of complexity on the selection of models in a market environment. We simulate a market involving three types of agents – buyers, non-expert sellers, and expert sellers who have access to better data statistics – interacting over multiple rounds. In this "market for models", all agents have access to the same data but must choose among different models that explain these data. Buyers are incentivized to select the most accurate model, while sellers also have an incentive to offer a model that gets chosen by the buyer. Our study will first assess how increased complexity affects the dynamics of model selection from both the sellers' and the buyers' perspectives. 

This experiment builds on a previous experiment (https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/13350) and adds one treatment, in which the agent are aware of the fact that one seller is an expert."
