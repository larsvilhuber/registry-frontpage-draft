abstract: "Collectively shared belief distortions or misperceptions and their implications have gained increasing attention by economists throughout the last decade. In this work we analyse the consequences of policy-related belief distortions for the case of climate change, a collective action problem of global scale where policy narratives are pervasive. We do so by surveying 2,000 households in each of the largest 24 EU member states (48,000 households in total). As part of this survey we conduct two experiments: (1) a choice experiment with randomized information treatment to analyse the effect of a climate policy narrative related belief distortions and updates, and (b) an incentivized choice experiment with 50% of the sample to elicit willingness to pay for climate action and how moralisation of attitudes related to the environment and paternalism correspond with actual behaviour.
