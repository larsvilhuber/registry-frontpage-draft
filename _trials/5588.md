abstract: "The study is derived from the initial idea that companies tend to hire employees with similar demographics to their current employees and/or leadership, which may lead to discrimination against underrepresented groups, such as women. This will be explored specifically in startups, where companies tend to be smaller and gender dynamics are a major topic of public discussion. The study will investigate whether or not gender discrimination can be observed at the initial applicant screening portion of the hiring process, and how any detected discrimination relates to the gender demographic and other characteristics of the companyâ€™s leadership, as can be determined through online research. Furthermore, if a large enough sample size can be obtained, the study will examine how gender discrimination might differ across types of firms and job titles within the startup world."
