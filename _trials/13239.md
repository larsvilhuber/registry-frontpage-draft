abstract: "The literature has generally documented that perceptions (i.e. beliefs about others) are more slow-moving than individual attitudes, often giving rise to misperceived social norms, i.e. discrepancies between individuals' attitudes and the attitudes they believe are held by others. We study this phenomenon in the context of beliefs about attitudes towards corruption and whistle-blowing among future civil servants in Indonesia. We will conduct a survey experiment in a population of future civil servants to learn about the role of misperceived norms of corruption in shaping the decision to report on corrupt behavior, and more generally, to engage in anti-corruption activities.
