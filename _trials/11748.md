abstract: "This paper examines the function of artificial intelligence (AI) as an assistant in a two-player trust game. Prior to the commencement of the game, the second player has the option to transmit a message to the first player. With the aid of AI, the second player can potentially enhance and rephrase the message before sending it. Similarly, the first player can utilize AI to comprehend the message received from the second player. To investigate the impact of AI on players' communication and decision-making in this strategic scenario, we conduct an experiment with various conditions: with or without AI assistance for the second player, the first player, or both, and whether the players have knowledge about their opponents receiving AI assistance or not."
