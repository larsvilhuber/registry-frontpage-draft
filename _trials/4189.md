abstract: "In 2014, the Union Government of Myanmar launched a National Social Protection Strategy with the aim of improving social assistance for the most vulnerable populations. Among other programs, the social protection plan comprises a large-scale pilot of a maternity and cash transfer program, aimed to ensure universal coverage for pregnant women and their children under two years of age.

This study will evaluate the causal impact of the maternal cash transfer program pilot on child nutrition, health, knowledge and adoption of health and hygiene practices, consumption, and labor outcomes. The experimental design varies the provision of cash transfers alone, or cash transfers paired with health informational meetings (SBCC), on a sample of about 6000 women in three townships of Myanmar dry zone. In the control group (149 villages), no program activities will be conducted. In one treatment arm (146 villages), cash transfers worth USD6.5–10 will be delivered to eligible women on a monthly basis. In the other treatment arm (142 villages), the cash transfers will be paired with a social behavioral communication change intervention (SBCC), which encompasses monthly informational meetings on nutrition, health, hygiene, and spending.

The project aims to rigorously evaluate program impacts, and to support government partners to make informed decisions about cash delivery design. The study is funded by the Livelihoods and Food Security Fund and the International Growth Center, and it will be conducted in partnership with Save the Children. "
