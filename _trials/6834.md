abstract: "There remain large differences in what men and women choose to study in university. These differences in major choice are often attributed to preferences and can explain part of the gender wage gap. This study tests whether the advice one receives perpetuates existing gender differences in academic preferences. The study consists of two parts. In the first part, teachers and counsellors are recruited to provide students with advice about university. In the second part of the study, I survey students before and after they see their own guidance counsellor to document what type of information they receive and whether their preferences change."
