abstract: "Electric vehicles (EVs) are expanding their market share across global vehicle fleets rapidly. Their impact on electric grids will largely depend on when they are charged. If charged during peak periods, when owners return from work, EVs will increase capacity costs of meeting system peaks. Conversely, charging during off-peak hours can take advantage of lower energy costs and minimize strain on the grid. Using a field experiment of EVs in an urban setting, we test the effectiveness of financial incentives vs moral suasion ``nudges'', both intended to shift charging to off-peak hours.
