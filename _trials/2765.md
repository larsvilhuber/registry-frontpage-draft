abstract: "The goal of this research is to examine the performance of public, private (NGO) and hybrid (public-private) governance (Mahoney, McGahan, & Pitelis, 2009; McGahan, Zelner, & Barney, 2013; Quélin, Kivleniece, & Lazzarini, 2017) in a resource-scarce environment (Baker & Nelson, 2005; George, McGahan, & Prabhu, 2012).  Therefore, this research aims to develop an understanding of how different governance structures deploy resources to promote the public interest by evaluating a job training program targeting residents of Brazilian favelas.  The research objective is to analyze alternative forms of commissioning resources under public versus private versus hybrid governance mode.  Specifically, we analyze how governance structure influences both the fulfillment of the public interest and the distribution of value among stakeholders engaged in the deployment.  Our setting allows a comparison of how much a non-profit organization can foster social prosperity – measured by the increased level of employment (formal and informal), income, the confidence level of individuals, the optimism level of individuals, among other outcomes. The approach is to compare these outcomes between individuals who undertook the training and those who did not.  Also, the research design enables us to understand whether the training is more effective when performed through the public organization, the NGO, or through a hybrid form.
