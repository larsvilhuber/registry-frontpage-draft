abstract: "Within a large retail chain we introduce a bonus payment for store managers and provide knowledge about the production function, implementing a 2x2 experimental design. The bonus is based on the storeâ€™s profit contribution margin (= sales - costs of goods sold - inventory shrinkage - personnel costs).
Store managers in one region in South-West Germany are randomly assigned to one of four treatments. 25% of store managers serve as the control group.  25% of store managers receive a bonus based on the contribution margin. Another 25% of store managers get access to an online training on the contribution margin as well as novel information about the profit margins of all products in the store. The remaining 25% receive both, the bonus and the information about the production function. 
Based on a theoretical model we hypothesize that both, giving only the bonus as well as only the further knowledge about the production function will increase performance. But we also hypothesize that there is a complementarity between both, i.e. the combination of both should lead the biggest increase.
