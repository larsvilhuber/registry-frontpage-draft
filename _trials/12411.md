abstract: "Educational apps for young children have become a ubiquitous feature of schools and classrooms. Despite the proliferation of educational apps, few studies have examined whether educational apps that interleave literacy and math language activities can work to improve student outcomes across an entire school district.  With school by classroom blocks, first-graders were randomly assigned to either a literacy only educational app or an interdisciplinary STEM educational app that included literacy and math language activities that focused on building students’ meta-linguistic skills and math quantitative language. Both intervention conditions provided a similar number of activities and implementation was equivalent, beginning in the fall 2023 school year and ending in spring 2024 (from November to April, approximately 6 months). The impact analysis will examine posttest differences on short-measures of engagement, domain specific vocabulary, listening, and reading comprehension, and long-term measures of basic literacy skills and math achievement."
