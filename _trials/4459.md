abstract: "This study examines whether vocational training for persons with disabilities (PWDs) in rural Cambodia improves economic, psychological, and social outcomes. The experiment randomly recruits PWDs with limb amputation or paralysis and only recruited PWDs can participate in the program, if they wish. I examine the impacts of the training on employment, earnings, discrimination, stigma, subjective well-being, and social capital two years after the completion of the program on average. The study covers 681 PWDs in 305 communities. The majority are landmine amputees.  "
