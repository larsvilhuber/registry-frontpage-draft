abstract: "Ending the AIDS epidemic is within reach due to lifesaving antiretroviral treatment which also prevents transmission. However, demand for HIV testing is low, and stigma is a potential barrier. We model HIV testing as a signal of risk, which causes discrimination from sexual partners who fear contracting HIV. We provide new information, randomized at the community level: antiretroviral treatment prevents HIV transmission, so a sexual partner who is diagnosed and treated is relatively safe. This reduces discrimination and increases HIV testing. These results suggest that HIV discrimination is partly explained by misinformation and can be mitigated."
