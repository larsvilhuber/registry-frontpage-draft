abstract: "This document describes a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Slovak Republic to identify intervention that help self-employed person to pay social insurance contribution's in correct amount. Social insurance in Slovakia is a complex system. The sum of contributions depends on several factors including income, etc. These factors change regularly, so the contribution change regularly as well. However, not all self-employed persons are able to follow these changes and as a result they pay wrong contribution amount or do not pay contributions. Prior research shows that simplification of the communicated information, moral appeal or deterrence could help increase the payment moral.  Our study aims to test the effect of these interventions on payment moral of self-employed person in the Slovak Republic. We use the letter experiment to employ interventions known in the literature.
