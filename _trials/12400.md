abstract: "Despite the centrality of training in proposals to reform policing, credible causal evidence on how police training impacts police behavior in the field is limited. We will evaluate a 40 hour classroom training program developed by the Anaheim Police Department (APD), which is intended to promote officer wellness and procedurally-just decision making. Officer volunteers were randomly assigned to a treated or waitlisted-control condition, with the treated group being assigned to a week long course lead by an experienced local police trainer. We evaluate this training through surveys of treated and control officers, surveys of adult Anaheim residents, as well as administrative data on police actions in the field."
