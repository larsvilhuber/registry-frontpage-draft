abstract: "The paper analyzes how peer effects relate to grade point average and decisions to join social groups such as fraternities. The results of the experiment indicate that residential peer effects are absent from major life decisions such as choice of college major. However, peer effects in GPA occur at the individual room level. Peer effects regarding fraternity membership occur both at the room level, whereas peer effects in fraternity membership occur both at the room level and the entire dorm level.
