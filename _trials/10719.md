abstract: "We study test-taking behavior in time-constrained exams and describe time's role in shaping the distribution of students' performance outcomes. We do this by leveraging a policy change in Turkey which increased the college entrance exam time. Supporting administrative school-level data with the experimental data we collected, we show that having more test time is significantly associated with less wrong answers and less skipping patterns in a multiple-choice test where negative marking exists. Moreover, this association varies by gender and ability which we proxy for using background data. Female students are less likely to gain from an extra minute than male students and above median students are less likely to gain from an extra minute than below median students. Besides the performance changes, we also find that more test-time reduces the standard error and thus leads convergence of scores to each other. These data patterns motivates us to construct a model of test-taking behavior in time-constrained exam settings to firstly quantify the gains and losses from the policy change and secondly provide alternative exam policies with counterfactual exercises, interacting test-time with other test settings."
