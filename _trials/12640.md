abstract: "Over recent decades, governments have spent significant resources in efforts to address gender inequality and to empower women. Although the benefits of these policies are well documented, less attention has been given to the unintended consequences that can occur when policies seek to improve outcomes for women. Recent evidence suggests that empowering women can lead to significant backlash in the form of increased discrimination and intimate partner violence. Despite this, there is little empirical research investigating the causes of backlash. Drawing on the existing literature on backlash, we aim to fill this gap by conducting novel experiments to causally test theoretical explanations for backlash."
