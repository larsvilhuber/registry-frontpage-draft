abstract: "We examine whether judicial review can affect nation building by studying how the ruling of the Spanish Constitutional Court on the Catalan Constitution affected Catalan support of secession. Using a public opinion survey we previously find that the ruling led to a 20% increase in support for Catalan independence from Spain in 2010. We expand these results by running our own survey which asks similar and new questions. To obtain the effect of the ruling on identity and preferences, we resort to priming techniques. The uploaded pre-analysis plan discusses the outcomes in the survey, the hypothesis to test, the empirical strategy, the experimental design, and power calculations. "
