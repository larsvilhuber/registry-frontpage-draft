abstract: "Behavioural economists often justify paternalistic policies by claiming that individuals have self-acknowledged self-control problems (SASCPs) they want other people or agencies to help them overcome. SASCPs are modelled by assuming individuals have ‘true’ preferences which they know but fail to act on. This approach promises to provide preference-based criteria for evaluating behavioural interventions, and to counter the objection that these are unacceptably paternalistic. But how prevalent SASCPs are remains an open question. The existence of true preferences has been questioned (Sugden, Community of Advantage, 2018). Laibson (AER, 2015) has noted that, in markets, individuals rarely pay for self-commitment. 

A putative counter-example is the case of gym users choosing membership tariffs rather than cheaper pay-as-you-go (PAYG) ones – ‘paying not to go to the gym’ (DellaVigna and Malmendier, AER, 2016). It is often argued that membership is chosen as a commitment device. However, there are alternative explanations: people may over-predict future consumption; the fixed membership fee provides insurance for people who are uncertain about their future preferences; by consolidating charges into a single payment, people reduce the ‘pain of paying’. 

This study develops a live online experiment that creates an environment analogous with the gym case. Each subject allocates time between ‘study’ episodes and playing computer games. The subject is then tested on her acquired knowledge and paid according to her score. Before she has any opportunities to study or play, she ranks a set of alternative tariffs for buying access to chapters, and is allocated to one of these. The experiment is set up to allow subjects to rank membership tariffs above PAYG ones but, if assigned to a membership tariff, to ‘pay not to study’. Our design discriminates between commitment, over-prediction, insurance and pain-of-paying explanations.
