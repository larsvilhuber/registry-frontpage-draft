abstract: "This study investigates how altruism (intrinsic motivation) and materialism  (extrinsic motivation) influence decision-making, specifically focusing on risk tolerance and time preferences. We manipulate participants' exposure to altruistic and materialistic primes and examine their impact on financial decision-making. Using an online experimental design, participants are randomly assigned to one of three groups: a control group, a group primed with materialism, and a group primed with altruism using pre-validated videos. Subsequently, participants complete multiple price list choices to assess their risk tolerance and time preferences."
