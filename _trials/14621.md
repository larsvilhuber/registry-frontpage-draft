abstract: "Substantial gender disparities in depression and suicide rates are observed worldwide. While women are more frequently diagnosed with depression, men have a substantially higher rate of completed suicides. This project aims to investigate whether gender differences in the recognition of mental health issues and the likelihood of seeking help contribute to these patterns. The project consists of (1) an analysis of mental health diagnoses and suicide data using administrative records from Norway, and (2) an online experiment with a representative U.S. sample, aiming to identify whether mental health symptom recognition and willingness to seek help differ by gender."
