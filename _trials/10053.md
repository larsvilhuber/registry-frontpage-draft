abstract: "Applied research relies heavily on data quality. As more and more researchers collect their own data through surveys, how to ensure data quality is a central issue for survey data. In this project, we plan to study the impact of survey modality on data quality. Specifically, we introduce three treatments in a field experiment on a set of 900 micro-entrepreneurs in Uganda: 1) whether to conduct the survey in person or over the phone, 2) whether to fix enumerator-respondent pairings across survey rounds, and 3) whether to include a trust-building activity prior to the survey. We also cross-cut the three treatments, which can help us understand how these treatments interplay with each other. We will assess how measurement varies for 1) simple, objective questions, 2) complex, objective questions, 3) subjective, sensitive questions, and 4) subjective, non-sensitive questions. We also measure and bound experimenter demand effects (EDE) by telling respondents the results we expect in a donation allocation task. We plan to study how EDE vary with each of our treatments."
