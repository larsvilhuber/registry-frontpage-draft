abstract: "In this project, we aim to assess i) whether customized payment and enrolment schedules can increase the adoption of health insurance schemes in rural agricultural settings; and ii) the extent to which health insurance schemes with optimized payment schedules can reduce seasonality in consumption, investment and care-seeking.

We propose to conduct a 3-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial with 2400 rural households in central Cote d’Ivoire. One third of the study clusters will receive enrolment support during the lean season, 1/3 of clusters will receive enrolment support during the post-harvest season, and 1/3 will serve as a control group. Households in the first arm will be further randomized to either start contributions immediately, or to complete enrolment but start contributions after the harvest.

This study will contribute to the growing literature on seasonal constraints and their welfare impacts. Through the supported provision of insurance, the study also has the potential to improve the health and wellbeing of participating households. "
