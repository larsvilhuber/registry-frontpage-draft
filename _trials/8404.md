abstract: "Social protection programs are expanding across the world, and face greater demand for delivering public value at a reasonable cost. There is evidence that insights from behavioral science- the science of how humans make decisions and take actions- can be used to achieve these objectives. ideas42, the World Bank, and the government of Ethiopia have been working together to enhance the effectiveness of the Urban Productive Safety Net Project (UPSNP) through a process of design, testing, and analysis. UPSNP was created to improve the income of targeted vulnerable households and establish urban safety net mechanisms. Research from the field of behavioral science along with a process of user-testing and iteration were used to design context-specific packages of interventions to increase the impact of the program on beneficiary outcomes. Specifically, the interventions are aimed at aiding beneficiaries to translate their intention of starting/expanding a business into a reality by completing the preparatory steps needed to start/expand a business in a timely manner. The upcoming RCT will survey about 1600 individuals across 5 kebeles in Ethiopia's city of Adama at baseline and again 6 months later during a follow-up to estimate if light-touch, low-cost interventions can improve short-term outcomes that may lead to more productive investments and better economic well-being in the long term."
