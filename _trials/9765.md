abstract: "We evaluate the impact of coffee agronomy training delivered (a) in-person through a farmer field school approach and (b) via recorded phone messages, on coffee agronomy practices of Ugandan smallholder farmers, through a randomized controlled trial involving 720 villages across 6 districts. For the in-person intervention, we also evaluate impact on coffee yield per tree. Coffee agronomy knowledge, gross coffee profit, household labor days spent on coffee, non-coffee income, income controlled by women, and the diversity and amount of food crops grown will be treated as secondary outcomes."
