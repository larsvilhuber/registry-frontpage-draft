abstract: "This project investigates the barriers to women’s leadership roles in VSLAs in Uganda. While VSLAs are prominent for financial inclusion and economic empowerment of women in Uganda, there is a gap in women’s representation in the VSLAs' leadership committees. This poses a challenge in materializing the full potential of women’s empowerment (both social and economic) through VSLAs as well as similar community groups. We investigate the impact of female leadership in VSLAs in Uganda by implementing a field experiment consisting in nudging VSLAs to appoint a new Chairperson. In randomly selected VSLAs, the nudge was to appoint a woman, in other randomly selected VSLAs, the nudge was to appoint a new male leader. In a third randomly selected set of VSLAs, we implement the female leadership nudge together with a mentoring intervention that put new female leaders in contact by phone with successful female leaders of other VSLAs. We assess the impact of the interventions on the gender composition of the VSLAs' leadership, the performance of the VSLAs, and the perceptions and attitudes of leaders and group members."
