abstract: "Why do some economic systems thrive while others fail? We explore the question in an experimental framework with the dynamic public good game (Gachter et al., 2017), where each agent's wealth at the end of period t serves as her endowment in t+1. We exogenously vary the initial endowment equality and the existence of market institutions for redistribution across treatments to examine factors that affect growth and inequality within and across experimental groups. In a 2 by 3 between-subject design, we vary two key factors: (1) whether participants' initial endowment is equal or unequal (with half of the participants receiving twice the endowment). (2) whether participants have the opportunity to redistribute, through uniform taxation, at the end of a period. Additionally, we compare whether the redistribution policy is endogenously voted among group members or exogenous given by the experimenter. 
At the end of the experiment, we also elicit for individuals' individual characteristics and risk-, social- and redistributive preferences.
We aim to identify the causal impact of initial equality and redistribution policies on growth and inequality, the correlation between individual preferences and cooperative behaviour (i.e., contribution and voting) and heterogeneous effects across individuals.
