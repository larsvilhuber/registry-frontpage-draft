abstract: "Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa face many threats to producing staple crops like maize. One of the major challenges is dealing with risk from droughts, floods and pest attacks. Insurance products can help reduce farmersâ€™ risk by providing them a financial benefit in the face of shocks. This in turn helps them build resilience that can make them better able to respond and survive current and future shocks. The objective of this study is to determine what amount of insurance coverage best increases smallholder farmers' resilience. Higher coverage is better but costs farmers (and/or organization subsidizing premiums) more. Specifically, we seek to answer two key questions in this project:
(1) Is there a threshold above which smallholder farmers in Malawi are resilient to common agricultural risks in their area? How can resilience be defined and measured?
(2) What level of maize insurance coverage do smallholder farmers need in order for them to meet the threshold of resilience to agricultural risks?"
