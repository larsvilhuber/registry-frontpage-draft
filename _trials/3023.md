abstract: "The gap in university enrolment by parental education is large and persistent in many countries. In this project, we investigate whether information about adults’ retrospective contentment with their educational decisions can close the gap in aspired university attainment of adolescents in Germany. For that purpose, we implement a survey experiment among a representative sample of adolescents aged between 14 and 17 years, in which treatment group members are informed about the share of adults who would obtain a different education degree than their actual one if they were 15 years old today. By comparing responses between the uninformed control group and the informed treatment group, we evaluate (i) whether information affects university aspirations per se and (ii) whether information affects the gap in aspirations by parental educational background.
