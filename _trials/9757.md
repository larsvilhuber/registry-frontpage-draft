abstract: "Income and resource inequalities are prevalent in modern society. Inequality gives rise to social classes and with it the emergence of social status based on desirable social image characteristics. We study how eligibility for a special social benefit based on low performance influences preferences for competitiveness using the tournament entry game in Niederle and Vesterlund (2007). This research question is important because participation in welfare programs may affect the preferences for competition of eligible recipients and contribute to wage disparities.There are two stages in our experiment. In the first stage, participants are randomly assigned to groups of three and they respond to a general knowledge quiz and based on their performance they are assigned as the low, medium, or high performing individual with higher earnings for higher performance. The lowest-performing individuals are eligible to receive a “welfare benefit” that they have to claim by coming to the front of the room, thereby inducing feelings of stigma associated with the benefit . We exogenously manipulate the benefit eligibility by adding a plausible deniability treatment in which we expanded the benefit eligibility criteria to the middle performing individuals. The size of the benefit relative to the earnings is 50% and 25% for the low and middle performance individuals. During the second stage subjects participate in an individual task paid piece-rate that serves as practice and to observe ability before deciding whether to enter a tournament competition in the same type of task.
