abstract: "As company emissions significantly contribute to climate change, government organizations are implementing policies to encourage companies to reduce their carbon footprint, such as the European Union's Sustainability Act. To comply with these policies, one proposed method is to direct employeesâ€™ attention to sustainable options using digital nudging. However, the literature on the effectiveness of digital nudging in promoting sustainable decision-making remains inconclusive. In addition, there is a lack of knowledge about the potential spillover effects of digital nudging on subsequent sustainable behavioral intentions. 
Our research aims to fill this gap by investigating the effects of digital nudging to guide employees to more sustainable decisions within a two-stage decision-making process. Therefore, we employ an online experiment, in a controlled environment, using crowd workers. Our between-subjects design ensures that participants randomly encounter one of four possible digital nudge scenarios: (i) receiving a digital nudge at both decision stages, (ii) only at the first decision stage, (iii) solely at the second decision stage, or (iv) not receiving a digital nudge at any stage."
