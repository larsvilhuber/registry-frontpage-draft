abstract: "We conduct a vignette-based survey experiment to assess the perceived fairness of considering race in a hiring decision. Our vignettes illustrate two canonical forms of discrimination studied by economists: taste-based and statistical discrimination, plus two sub-types of each.  In addition, we will randomly reverse the races of the discriminator and discriminatee.  These interventions will allow us to estimate how the type of discriminatory action and race of the persons involved affect the perceived fairness of discriminatory actions. They will also allow us to assess the appropriateness of three broad models of perceived fairness in this context:  utilitarian social preferences, in-group bias, and rules-based ethics.  To our knowledge our study will be the first to assess the conditions under which a large sample of respondents perceive discrimination as more versus less unfair.  "
