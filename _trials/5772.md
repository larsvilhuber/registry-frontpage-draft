abstract: "The COVID-19 pandemic has threatened many human lives and economic activities in the world. Governments worldwide took several measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus including law-, military-, and/or technology-enforced lock-downs. However, not all the governments immediately took such ``hard" measures, but some, such as Sweden and Japan, took ``soft" measures, e.g., providing political messages to citizens so that they take self-restraint actions on their own.

Despite the flood of administrative messages asking for self-restraint of leaving home, and the emergency declaration by the government on April the 7th, since there are no practical fines against the violations, there are some people who would not comply. This situation has become a social issue and has revealed how difficult it is for a government to guide citizens by providing advisory messages even though the whole society obviously benefits in the long run by following them.

With this circumstance in Japan, this study conducts a Randomized Controlled Trial experiment to investigate causal effects of information provisions to individuals on their self-restraint behaviors with consideration of two novel features in our messages. The first feature we test is the power of the Royals over the political authority. The second one to be examined is the power of personalized messages over commonly shared slogans. We will test if those new features could enhance self-restraint behaviors among Japanese citizens."
