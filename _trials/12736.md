abstract: "In France, the unemployment rate of vocational students is high compared to apprentices who get the same diploma. In this project, we evaluate a short counseling and job search assistance program for vocational students. The program consists of three sessions of around two hours. This is a group-level treatment which takes place in classes during regular school times, and it complements courses provided by teachers aiming to help students for their professional orientation. Counselors intervene in the class with the teacher for around 6 hours at some point between January and May. We randomize at the school level. All students at the treated schools are offered to participate in the treatment. The schools of the control group do not get any treatment."
