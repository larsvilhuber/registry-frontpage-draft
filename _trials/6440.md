abstract: "Background: Flipped classroom is a type of blended learning where students watch online lectures at home followed by working together in groups in the classroom with the teacher as a guide. It is called flipped because what is traditionally considered homework is now moved into the classroom, while the traditional lecture in the classroom is now moved home. 
Aim: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of flipped classroom compared to traditional lectures in a statistics and epidemiology course at the pharmacy study program at Oslo Metropolitan University. 
Method: The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial, where one group of students receives traditional lectures, while another group of students receives flipped classroom teaching. Primary outcome is exam grade. Secondary outcome is how satisfied the students are with the course.
