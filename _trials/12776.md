abstract: "Through a lab-in-the-field experiment, we will study the effect of gender-based social norms on intra-household financial decision-making among couples across three neighbouring societies in India - the Khasi society in Meghalaya, the Karbi society and the Dimasa society in Assam. Outcomes will be measured through behavioural experiment games and a post-experiment survey separately among spouses at a lab-in-the-field setting.
