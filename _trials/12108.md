abstract: "Using a novel locally grown health service delivery model in Bangladesh that tracks the universe of newly married couples and connects them to local health services, we aim to study whether targeting mothers early in pregnancy with three complementary interventions -- individually or in combination -- can improve their own wellbeing as well as their children’s developmental outcomes. Our outcomes of interest include women’s empowerment, parental inputs, physical and mental health, and children’s health and development."
