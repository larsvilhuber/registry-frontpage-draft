abstract: "We will study the sensitivity of partisan cheerleading to financial incentives over a broad range of topics. We are particularly interested in the degree to which financial incentives may be able to decrease partisan cheerleading in some areas but not in others. We expect there may be a systematic pattern in the nature of these areas which we will test for in our survey."
