abstract: "Social norms have been shown to be a central part of a wide range of decision making, including cooperation. Social norms have also been shown to be highly susceptible to context, which acts to cue or prime a specific mental mode. Despite recent methodological improvements in eliciting social norms, this has not been extended to ‘hypothetical’ social norms. This study investigates whether ‘hypothetical’ social norms can be reliably determined by ‘actual’ social norms across subjects in a framed Public Goods Game. The primary contributions of this study is methodological."
