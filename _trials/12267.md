abstract: "The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in China is as high as 10.8%. Aside from progressing to end-stage renal disease, CKD significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases and malignant tumors, leading to substantial healthcare consumption. Abundant research evidence suggests that early detection and intervention in CKD management can effectively control the progression of the disease. However, the awareness of CKD in China is only 10.0%, particularly low among individuals with early-stage CKD, underscoring the necessity for public kidney disease health education and early screening.
Preliminary research revealed that traditional poster campaigns and continuing education for community healthcare providers had limited effectiveness. This study is based on the context of CKD health education and screening for community residents, which will be conducted at a public venue in a community in Beijing, specifically involving the placement of different CKD promotional posters in different time intervals. It explores the impact of various health education strategies on community residents' participation rates (viewing, inquiries, and receiving test kits) using different types of information (health hazard, time cost, conformity information). It investigates the effect of different health education strategies on CKD high-risk populations in the community, concerning CKD screening and ongoing monitoring."
