abstract: "This research comprises three studies investigating the compensating wage differential for cashier’s stress in dealing with payments made in cash. Hypothesis 1 is that, if cashiers incur stress from dealing with payments made in cash, then they must be paid a higher wage. Hypothesis 2 is that physiological measure of stress is greater when cashiers are dealing with payments made in cash than when dealing with payments made with card.

The first study exploits variation across countries and over time in the proportion of retail purchases in cash. It uses multi-country panel data to study cashier’s wages as a function of the proportion in cash and wages of other similarly skilled occupations.  

The second study is a discrete choice “vignette experiment” in which cashiers at a major supermarket group in Singapore are required to choose between receiving payment by card and payment in cash with different monthly wages. This experiment enables the researcher to identify the compensating wage differential at which cashiers switch from preferring card to preferring cash, and also heterogeneity in the differential across cashiers with different background.

The third study is a laboratory experiment that studies the physiological effect of dealing with cash payments versus card payments. 

The first and second studies are already underway. The objective of this application is to register the third study. Subjects in this experiment will take part in a series of cashier tasks. The manipulation is whether a high proportion of payments is made in cash. Stress level will be measured by heart rate variability (HRV), which will be monitored using an electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rate device attached to the subjects’ chest throughout the experiment. "
