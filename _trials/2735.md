abstract: "Communication and language is ubiquitous in the evolution of cooperation. However, the power of language is frequently expressed in terms of solving complex problems that arise among people who need to coordinate their behavior to solve them (Wilson and Harris, 2017; Bickerton, 2009; 2014). If communication is to be regarded as a key ingredient for the achievement of a common good, should we not expect its merits to translate to the least complex dilemmas that often characterize everyday situations? Numerous problems are simple to solve coordination wise – one often needs to persuade only one other person to cooperate and not necessarily many. But, even in these seemingly simple situations the other person needs to choose to behave appropriately. The present paper examines if and how language is used to foster cooperation between two people in a repeated prisoner’s dilemma game with mutual partner choice"
