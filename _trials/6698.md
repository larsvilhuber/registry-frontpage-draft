abstract: "Our proposed work returns to the open question of the existence and extent of consumer- based discrimination, asking what role consumers play in gender-based discrimination in labor markets and workplaces in the developing world. Using experimentally-induced variation in consumers’ perceptions of online chat agents’ genders, we will estimate the effect of consumer-side discrimination on both individual and aggregate worker productivity. Specifically, we partner with an online sales company and randomly assign gender-specific names to agents, careful to remove any indications of the assigned names from the agents themselves."
