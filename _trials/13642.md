abstract: "Small-holder farmers in low-income countries face substantial weather risk. To reduce these risks, governments provide long-range forecasts about the amount of rain that will occur during the agricultural season, which can be disseminated in advance of the start of the season. In this project, we partner with the Indian Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare (MoA&FW) to randomize SMS-based dissemination of the Indian Meterological Department's India-wide total monsoonal rainfall forecast among 128,000 farmers living in 22 subdistricts where this forecast has been shown to be particularly effective. We will measure the effects of these forecasts on farmer beliefs and agricultural activity. "
