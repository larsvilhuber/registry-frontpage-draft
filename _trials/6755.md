abstract: "In the proposed experiment, we aim to study the impact of the current coronavirus pandemic on preferences for local food and on the support for farmers with a charitable donation decision. We also aim to distinguish the impact of individual or personal concerns from related concerns focused on the communities where these individuals live. We propose an online experiment in which participants are reminded, before answering questions about their preference for local food, about the impact of the current pandemic on either themselves or their community. We plan to recruit around 1,000 participants from the Mid-Atlantic region with the help of the survey provider Dynata LLC. "
