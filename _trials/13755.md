abstract: "This project investigates reporting patterns among pre-registered studies in economics. We have developed a minimal set of reporting standards and will apply them to a sample of approximately 400 studies registered in the American Economic Association (AEA) Registry. To better understand authors' reporting behavior, we will conduct a randomized control trial (RCT) aimed at increasing the reporting of results from pre-specified analyses. (Note: given that participants in our sample can potentially access this registration on the AEA RCT registry, we have recorded all the answers to the required registry fields in the time-stamped pre-analysis plan (PAP), which will remain embargoed until the end of our intervention.)"
