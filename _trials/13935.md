abstract: "We study interpersonal trust and trustworthiness in the context of virtual reality (VR) by adapting the canonical trust game to VR. We first replicate the classic trust game paradigm in a VR environment, aiming to assess the generalizability of trust game findings from traditional lab conditions to high-immersive virtual environments (like Metaverse). 

Additionally, we also explore the influences of incongruity between real entities (humans) and avatars on trust and trustworthiness. Incongruity refers to the mismatch between an individual's self-perception and their representation in a virtual environment, such as the appearance or voice of their avatar. The findings from this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of how trust and trustworthiness are influenced by the (in)congruity between one's real identity and virtual representation, which is particularly relevant for prosocial behaviors and economic transactions in virtual environments."
