abstract: "The sustainable economic development of the rice sector in sub-Sarahan Africa (SSA) required technological solutions, such as digitized extension service. This study aimed to seek appropriate payment methods for the sustainable development and adoption of digitized extension service business models. Three business models based on three different payment methods will be tested using a randomized control trial. The main outcome variable is rice yield and secondary outcome variables are creditworthiness, household income, well-being, and food security."
