abstract: "Health care delivery at the local level is weak in many developing countries. In many cases, citizens have little information on the quality of the health services that are actually being provided and almost no basis of comparing what they can observe with what they are supposed to be receiving.  They also have little sense of what they might do with the information they may have to improve the quality of local health service delivery.  Furthermore, frontline health providers themselves may have little sense of how their performance, and the health of the community they serve, compares to that of other health facilities and communities.

This project constitutes a scaled up replication of the “Power to the People” intervention (Björkman and Svensson, 2009; henceforth P2P).  P2P collected information about health delivery in local health facilities, distributed this information to citizens and frontline providers in a report card, mobilized citizens and providers in light of this information, and organized meetings in which citizens and providers could jointly discuss how to improve health outcomes in the community.  The study reported striking impacts on infant weights, under-5 mortality, community engagement, and other outcomes.  Given these extremely large reported effects, there has been strong interest in testing whether the P2P findings replicate at a larger scale.

The present study employs a factorial design to replicate P2P and also break its complex treatment into two of its principal components: 1) the provision of information about health delivery quality to citizens and clinic staff and the mobilization of these actors in light of this information and 2) the holding of interface meetings between community members and clinic staff in which the action plans they each develop can be discussed and coordinated.  379 health facilities (and associated catchment areas) are randomized to receive each part of the treatment (or, in some cases, both together, as in P2P).
