abstract: "This study would experimentally test a strategy for boosting registration rates and for promoting accuracy and completeness of registrations in a new registry for causal inference studies in education and the broader social sciences. The ultimate goal is to establish efficient registration processes for study leads (also referred to as study directors) and to boost the registration enterprise as a whole. With funding from the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), SREE is in the final stages of developing a registry of causal inference studies in education and the broader social sciences, hereafter referred to as the Registry of Efficacy and Effectiveness Studies (REES). The proposed project entails conducting a randomized control trial to learn about benefits to pre-populating a registration with data for completed studies, as well as to gain valuable feedback from a sizable number of early study registrants that will help us improve the design and launch of REES. This information will be especially valuable for guiding refinements to improve the potential for REES to serve as a reliable source for identifying all causal inference studies in education. The project also will contribute to the overall evidence base on how to increase integrity, rigor, and access to causal inference research in education."
