abstract: "We present a sample of savings account holders with three choices: to keep their existing account but incur high fees, to close their existing account and receive the balance, or to open a new account with lower fees and transfer the balance to it. These subjects come from 14 villages in southern Malawi. In 2012, as part of a previous study, they were offered fully subsidized basic savings accounts with a local bank. In 2015, some of those who had opened accounts were randomly chosen to receive a MK 25,000  windfall payment (USD 160 using the 2015 purchasing power parity [PPP] exchange rate. See Brune et al. 2017 for details). This transfer did not have persistent effects on savings or spending, but it did increase the number of transactions that subjects made at the bank branch.  The random allocation of these transfers thus created exogenous variation in the experience subjects had in using their accounts.

In 2016, the previous research project concluded and subsidies for monthly account maintenance fees were discontinued. Starting in May 2016, individuals had to pay a monthly maintenance fee that had previously been covered by research funds paid directly to the bank. Concurrently but independently, the bank introduced a new account called the Pafupi account. This account had an opening cost, no monthly fees but charged a withdrawal fee per transaction. Based on the number of transactions that subjects had made between 2012 and May 2016, the Pafupi accounts were less expensive than the original (basic) accounts for everyone in the sample, if their usage patterns continued and they planned to keep the account open for at least another four months. 

In March and April 2016, the research team visited study subjects at home and asked them to come to the bank branch to make a decision about their savings accounts. Subjects could keep their existing basic account and start paying monthly fees, could close their basic account, or could transfer their balances to a Pafupi account with the purchase of an ATM card. Although the Pafupi account was cheaper than the basic account given their past usage, the choice was presented in a neutral way. "
