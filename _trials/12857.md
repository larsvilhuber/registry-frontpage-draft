abstract: "The fall-army worm (FAW) increases food insecurity and income uncertainty in Uganda due to its sizeable negative effect on maize yield. Agroecological Integrated Pest Management (IPM) provides a promising approach to mitigate maize damages while minimizing environmental harm from control methods. However, agroecological IPM is also costly for farmers in terms of initial investments and maintenance (labor) costs. This study evaluates whether signaling opportunities at different costs may help overcome these costs and impact adoption decisions of an agroecological IPM package. We also compare the effect of signaling to the effect of loss/gain framing for a material incentive. In addition, we determine the effectiveness of an agroecological IPM approach on agricultural outcomes. The study aims to evaluate these questions using empirical evidence from a field experiment in 140 villages with 2240 farmers in Soroti District, Uganda.  "
