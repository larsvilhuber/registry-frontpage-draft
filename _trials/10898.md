abstract: "Individuals often make educational and professional decisions conditional on feedback of their performance. In educational settings, students receive grades as the primary source of feedback. These grades may impact how students choose to allocate their efforts, as well as influence future educational decisions (major, course enrollment, etc.). The most challenging issue in this line of research is the lack of a exogenous variation in feedback.  We aim to overcome this selection issue by adopting an experimental design in which we randomly assign graders of varying innate harshness (despite consistent guidelines) to blindly grade short essays in two large introductory economics courses. With this, we are able to analyze the causal effect of a grade’s harshness/lenience on students’ subsequent decisions and outcomes. We also measure students’ grade expectations (confidence) and track grade challenges, enabling us to characterize a potential casual channel (confidence) and identify heterogeneities in the resistance to feedback."
