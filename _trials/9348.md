abstract: "Why do couples hide income and what are the possible consequences? I hypothesize that couples hide income from each other because they have misaligned preferences, and an individual is more likely to hide from their spouse if they don’t have a say over how to allocate household resources. I recruit married couples from Kenya to a lab experiment, where they allocate lab endowment between a private pot and a household pot. I study how exogenously unobservable income affect individual’s choices to share income and to consume.

In addition, I measure spousal hidden income using a household survey. I ask each individual to report their own income, savings, transfers and expenditures, as well as their spouse's income, savings, transfers and expenditures. I hypothesize that individuals underestimate spouses income, and they may also underreport their own income when asked in front of spouse."
