abstract: "This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of "behavioral insights" and "monetary incentives" in promoting consumers' selection of plant-based foods (PBF), which are expected to address food issues such as the protein crisis and serve as a countermeasure against global warming. The research will be conducted through a randomized field experiment using purchase data collected via a smartphone household account book application. The data collected in this study is characterized by its ability to track individuals across stores, business formats, and product categories, allowing for a high-resolution capture of daily purchasing behavior. Moreover, this experiment is a "Natural Field Experiment" (NFE) where participants are unaware of their involvement, which is particularly advantageous in naturally observing consumers' daily food choices. This research aims to elucidate the following two points: (1) Using high-resolution data, we will rigorously determine the impact of consumer appeals utilizing behavioral insights, such as nudges, on PBF selection, including long-term effects. (2) Based on previous studies suggesting that information provision alone is insufficient to induce behavioral changes in food selection and that a combination with monetary incentives is crucial, we will examine the effect of monetary incentives (specifically, point cashback) on PBF selection, as well as the combined effect of nudges and monetary incentives. This study will contribute to our understanding of effective strategies to promote plant-based food consumption, addressing both environmental and nutritional challenges."
