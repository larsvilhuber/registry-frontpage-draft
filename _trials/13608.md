abstract: "Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits are critical in helping workers smooth consumption when they lose a job through no fault of their own. However, only about half of eligible unemployed workers in the United States claim UI benefits. This randomized trial investigates the impact of outreach from the Washington State Employment Security Department – the agency that administers UI for the state – to individuals who are likely to be eligible for UI. Specific treatment arms of the information provision field experiment will seek to identify key mechanisms underlying incomplete UI take-up. We intend to study the effects of the outreach on not only UI applications and receipt but also job search outcomes such as non-employment duration and re-employment wages."
