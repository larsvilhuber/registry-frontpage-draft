abstract: "Migrant remittances are one of the largest international financial flows to developing countries. In 2008, migrant remittances sent to developing countries amounted to US$338 billion, roughly three times larger than foreign aid flows. However, very little is known about how the development impact of these funds can be maximized. The hypothesis driving this research is that remittances may have greater long-run development impact when migrants sending these remittances are given more control and monitoring over how the funds are used by recipients. Surveys of migrants consistently find that education is among the most important categories of expenditures that migrants seek to fund in the home country. This project tests the impact of providing migrant workers with a better ability to control the use of remittances for education, and to monitor the educational performance of sponsored students. We will focus on overseas Filipino workers in Rome. In collaboration with a major Philippine bank remittance channel and a respected Philippine NGO with expertise in managing privately-funded educational scholarships, the principal investigators will evaluate demand for and the impact of a new educational payment and monitoring facility. 
This facility – dubbed EduPay – will provide overseas Filipinos with the ability to pay educational institutions in the Philippines directly from overseas, without channeling the funds through a relative or other “trustee”, and also provide information to the overseas migrant on the performance (attendance, grades) of the sponsored student.
