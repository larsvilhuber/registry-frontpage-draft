abstract: "When people try to achieve a goal, bracketing of goals (in our experiments, bimonthly goals or a yearly goal) can affect their motivations and outcomes. Though the recent literature on psychology and economics has documented the potential importance of goal bracketing, its evidence is still scarce. We plan to conduct randomized controlled trials to study the effects of bracketing of weight goals. Specifically, we identify the effects of goal bracketing of individual goal reminders and social comparisons. We further plan to investigate underlying mechanisms from the unique food purchase panel data. "
