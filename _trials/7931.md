abstract: "In this document, we provide the intervention details, research design, and outcome analysis plan for the impact evaluation of a basic mobile phone-based educational program in rural South-West Bangladesh. During the prolonged school closure because of the COVID-19 pandemic, most children in rural Bangladesh are missing out on formal education as they have very limited access to online and other forms of distance education. We develop a set of audio lessons using an Interactive Radio Instruction (IRI) methodology – a method that allows learners to stop and react to questions and exercises through verbal response and to engage in physical and intellectual activities with a ‘special helper’, such as an adult household member, while the program is ‘on the air’. We deliver these lessons to children in grades two to four over 15 weeks via basic mobile phones using an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system as the basic mobile phone penetration rate in rural Bangladesh is significantly higher than other one-way technologies such as radio and television. In this study, we examine whether providing remote learning opportunities through IVR improves children's cognitive and noncognitive skills. "
