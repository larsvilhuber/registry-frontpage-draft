abstract: "In low income countries, overweight and obesity are more widespread among rich individuals. In contexts where income information is limited, high body mass might be exploited as signal of wealth. In this project I study how individuals' body mass affects their chance of accessing credit via a survey experiment in Uganda. Respondents are loan officers from a random subsample of licensed money lending institutions from the metropolitan area of Kampala, the capital. Loan officers are a key step in the process of accessing credit: They screen prospective clients, verify their information and upon verification, determine whether applicants qualify for the selected loan.

In the survey experiment, loan officers evaluate multiple hypothetical loan applications. As in the IRR paradigm by Kessler et al. (WP 2019), truthful answers are incentivised by providing real referrals. In the applications, I randomise body mass of hypothetical applicants, and evaluate how this affects loan officers' evaluations. My measure of access to credit are the loan officer’s 1) choice of meeting the hypothetical applicant; 2) likelihood of qualifying the loan application; 3) charged interest rate. Furthermore, to investigate the mechanism at play, I elicit 4) assessment of the applicant’s creditworthiness and 5) assessment of the applicants' ability to put the loan to productive use. 

Loan officers evaluate in total 30 hypothetical applications, which are split into three treatment arms, which vary how much and in which way information on the applicant is presented (within-subject design). The three arms allow to pin down the mechanism at play, by allowing to understand at which point of the decision making process does the discrimination bites. 

This set up allows to (1) test whether body mass affects perceived creditworthiness and access to credit, (2) test whether reducing asymmetric information on income changes the relevance of body mass in determining the decision, and (3) understand at which, if any, step of the decision making process does the discrimination bites.
