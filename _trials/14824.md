abstract: "Over the past decades central banks around the world have become increasingly likely to communicate their policy decisions and the rationale that led to them. Traditionally, this communication is aimed at select groups of experts. However, communicating with the general public is of no lesser importance.

One issue facing central banks that want to communicate with the public is that the public rarely engages with the central banks directly. Instead, the public is more likely to receive news about the economy through the media. The aim of this research is to investigate how the public's inflation expectations and trust in the central bank is impacted by media reporting vis-a-vis direct communication from the central banks."
