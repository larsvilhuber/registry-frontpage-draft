abstract: "Demand management has become an important strategy for utilities to address electricity production shortfalls and intermittent issues resulting from the transition to renewable energy. Many utilities apply increasing block tariffs to prevent pricing low-income households out of basic electricity access, while simultaneously discouraging wasteful overconsumption by high-income households. However, consumers' limited understanding of or attention to such complex pricing systems can result in private and socially sub-optimal behavior, rendering nonlinear pricing ineffective for energy conservation. This project aims to determine whether enhancing the understanding of energy use and nonlinear electricity pricing can help households respond to marginal pricing, thereby increasing energy conservation. We are conducting a large-scale experiment covering 45,000 users of a recently launched mobile app from a state-owned electric utility company in Vietnam. The treatment groups receive either a real-time app display of their estimated daily marginal prices or their total estimated bills to date, for a minimum of six months. To assess and compare the persistent effects of providing high-frequency nonlinear price and total cost information on consumer behavior, we will gather electricity billing data from the participants for one year before and after the experiment."
