abstract: "In March 2019, Cyclone Idai hit central Mozambique and caused widespread damage, including businesses in the enterprise sector. We use panel data and a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to estimate the impact of unconditional cash grants on micro enterprises and their recovery. We find that, on average, the cash grants had a positive effect on firm revenue, profits and savings, as well as on the likelihood of having their roof repaired. The cash had a stronger impact in the more damaged city (Beira) compared to the less affected location (Chimoio). These findings indicate that access to finance is critically important for firm recovery following a natural disaster."
