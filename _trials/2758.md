abstract: "Non-profit entities are increasingly called upon to protect, advocate for and manage natural resources. To complete protection and management objectives these entities must engage the public in funding efforts. One way to engage the public is to underscore the economic value of the natural world. Enhancing our understanding of how citizens use economic valuation information in making contribution decisions strengthens the ability of a diverse set of decision-makers to make choices about unveiling economic valuation information. We draw on (i) a growing literature on charitable environmental giving (Messer, Zarghamee, Kaiser & Schulze, 2007; Bochet, Page & Puttermand, 2006), and (ii) a robust literature indicating that message framing, here economic valuation as information, is an important tool for communicating complex environmental decisions (Goff, Waring and Noblet, 2017; Van de Velde, Verbeke, Popp, & Van Huylenbroeck, 2010; Scannell & Gifford, 2013). We also investigate the effect that environmental motivations (intrinsic versus extrinsic) may play in how people respond to economic valuation information. Key extensions follow from our work in considering the role that economic valuation information may play in citizen support for future environmental policies aimed at protecting and managing public natural resources.
