abstract: "What do financial advisors consider good for a client? To what extent do advisors merely provide information and advice, and to what extent do they push the client towards the course of action they recommend, if given the opportunity? Do different advisors give similar advice to the same client, or does advice differ widely? How do these proclivities vary depending on whether the client is black or white, male or female, and financially more or less sophisticated? We answer these questions using an artefactual field experiment in which professional financial advisors give advice and place restrictions on how a real individual may invest a principal of $20,000. We also explore clients' demand for financial advisors by studying to what extent they delegate the investment decision. Finally, how does advisors' supply and clients' demand for advice match?"
