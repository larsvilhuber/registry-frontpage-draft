abstract: "In this study, we aim to understand the nature of prosocial motives in decisions to vaccinate against Covid-19 through information provision experiment. Different statements will focus on prosocial motives of vaccination by highlighting benefits of vaccination, or by highlighting social loss when not vaccinating. Also, each statement will be combined with strategic concerns that promote self-interest, to separate prosocial concerns from selfish, strategic concerns. This study will illuminate the nature of vaccine hesitancy in the context of a major developing country, where evidence remains relatively scarce in the literature. Furthermore, our study will contribute to the literature by showing the effects of social gain and social loss framing on individual choice. "
