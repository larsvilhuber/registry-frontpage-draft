abstract: "We conduct a three person legislative bargaining experiment in the lab. The main treatment variable is the decision rule (unanimity vs. majority rule). The game involves a probability of "breakdown" following failure of a proposal. In case of breakdown, players receive exogenously fixed breakdown values. These breakdown values are private information in some of the experimental periods. Our main hypothesis is that subjects are more likely to vote "no" (on comparable proposals) and to claim (via free form messages) that they have a high breakdown value under unanimity rule than under majority rule, resulting in lower agreement rates."
