abstract: "In rural Tanzania, approximately 80% of the population has access to some sort of basic latrine, though the majority of these latrines do not meet the UNICEF-WHO Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) definitions of improved.  The low quality of most rural sanitation facilities contributes to poor public health and, thereby, hinders economic growth.  To address these concerns, the Government of Tanzania launched the National Sanitation Campaign to increase the proportion of rural households with improved sanitation. Latrine slabs (SanPlats) were designed at relatively low-cost and introduced to provide a smooth, easily cleaned, and safe opening for pit latrines. Several sanitation campaigns have promoted demand for SanPlats; however, efficient systems for supplying SanPlats currently do not exist in Tanzania.  

The aims of this study are twofold (1) to determine what consumer demand is for latrine slabs at various price points and whether demand at a given price point increases through community exposure and/or sensitization campaigns and (2) to assess potential involvement of private business operators in the improved sanitation supply chain for increasing the availability of latrine slabs to rural Tanzanian households.
