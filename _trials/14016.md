abstract: "Our research analyzes the impact of relative feedback on the academic performance and motivation of university students at one of the leading universities in Madrid. After the students take a midterm exam, the treatment group is given their percentile rank in relation to the class average grades. At the end of the course, we aim to determine whether the feedback's impact on the treatment group improves their grades or, conversely, if it leads to overconfidence and worsens their results."
