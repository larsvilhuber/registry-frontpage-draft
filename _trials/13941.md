abstract: "We will conduct a survey experiment to measure the effect of information about the Indian government’s policies towards reducing air pollution on respondents’ opinions of the government’s work. One treatment arm includes information about the Indian government’s policy to reduce air pollution. A second treatment arm informs respondents that the program has thus far not been effective in meeting air pollution targets set forth in the policy. A control arm will provide no information about the government’s policies or progress on reducing air pollution. We will measure the effect of information treatment on respondents’ opinions of the government’s work to reduce air pollution."
