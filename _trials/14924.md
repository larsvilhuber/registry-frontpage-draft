abstract: "The provision of personal information in online interactions - the social presence - reduces social distance and therefore increases trust. This includes profile pictures, personal descriptions, video or voice messages, and other forms of direct communication that enhance the perception of human interaction. Advances in artificial intelligence have enabled the creation of convincing and realistic deepfakes, which could potentially undermine the concept of social presence. Deepfakes are artificial but hyper-realistic media content (video, audio, image) and allow the creation of artificial profile pictures, audio or video messages, which can therefore be used to manipulate the social presence. This poses a severe challenge, as the quality and therefore believability of deepfakes increased to the point that people are often unable to reliably differentiate between authentic and artificial content. Audio deepfakes may alter vocal features such as gender, emotion, and perceived trustworthiness, which potentially affect others’ behavior. 
This experimental study examines the impact of audio deepfakes on trust-based decision-making. It investigates whether manipulated vocal characteristics in an artificial audio message as pre-play communication affects behavior in a trust game - for both the sender and receiver. The findings may provide insights into how artificially generated media influences trust and decision-making in online interactions.
