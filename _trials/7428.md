abstract: "This research project aims to experimentally investigate information barriers to small firm consolidation. We exploit rich panel data on the universe of garment making firm owners in Hohoe, Ghana, including owner and owner household characteristics, firm characteristics and outcomes, and reported within-industry peer network interactions. We elicit firm owners’ willingness to pay for information about within-industry peer willingness to hire and be hired by the owner using Becker-Degroot-Marschak method and exploit the conditionally random variation to study the impacts of such information on firm-level growth and profitability as well as dyadic-level mergers."
