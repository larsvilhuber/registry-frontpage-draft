abstract: "The project aims to understand how people think about climate change, including what they think about mitigation policies that look to address it. In particular, it aims to study how attitudes on climate change mitigation policies differ between countries.
We want to understand how respondents set priorities to fight climate change; what they think governments can and should do to mitigate climate change; what people think is fair in terms of policies.
Finally, we will provide some information treatments to see to what extent perceptions can change after receiving new information and if such information treatments will have an effect on policy preferences. Thanks to the geographical variation of our data, we will analyze if living in areas more vulnerable to impacts from climate change affects perceptions and preferences for different policies, such as a carbon tax or a green infrastructure program."
