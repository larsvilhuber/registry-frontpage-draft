abstract: "This project aims to investigate the value that rice farmers in Côte d’Ivoire place on both African rice landraces maintained by the AfricaRice genebank as well as advanced rice varieties developed through AfricaRice’s breeding programs such as the inter-specific hybrid ARICA varieties and the aromatic Oryza sativa variety ORYLUX. This will take place through a field experiment including the implementation of a payment for agrobiodiversity conservation services (Drucker and Ramirez 2020) programme for landraces and the assignment of seed of advanced rice varieties based on the willingness-to-pay (WTP) of surveyed farmers. Methodologically, we will combine a typical randomized controlled trial approach with a simplified version of the open selective trials methodology proposed by Chassang et al. (2012). 

AfricaRice manages one of the largest collections of drought-tolerant African rice (Oryza glaberrima) in the world, as well as traditional African landraces of Oryza sativa (Asian rice), which is thought to have been introduced to West Africa in the 1500s. Domesticated in West Africa about 3,000 years ago and indigenous to the continent, the cultivation of Oryza glaberrima has declined and been replaced in farmers’ fields in many cases by the higher-yielding Asian rice (Oryza sativa). However, its genetic resources are of interest due to a number of valuable traits such as tolerance to drought, soil acidity, and iron and aluminum toxicity in the genepool, as well as other qualitative traits such as taste, aroma, cooking qualities, and others.

While much research has focused on the impact of the interspecific NERICA varieties bred by AfricaRice (e.g. Kijima et al. 2008), less work has investigated the value of the newer generation of ARICA (and ORYLUX) varieties or attempted to investigate the value farmers place on African rice landraces and farmers' varieties of both Oryza glaberrima and Oryza sativa. 

The significance of this research is thus its combined investigation of how farmers value both newer advanced rice varieties bred through AfricaRice’s programmes as well as rice landrace varieties conserved by the AfricaRice genebank (including both O. sativa and O. glaberrima landraces). In addition, the study’s use of an extended randomized controlled trial / open selective trials methodology through a field experiment will be used to investigate how farmer heterogeneity impacts the valuation of rice genetic diversity (both traditional and improved) in the West African context.
