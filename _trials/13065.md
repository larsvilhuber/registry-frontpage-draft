abstract: "In many poor countries, youth in rural areas struggle to get jobs or start new businesses. Nevertheless, most economic development interventions prioritize “development in place,” rather than facilitating movement to places or sectors with greater opportunity. The Immigration Policy Lab at Stanford University, in collaboration with Mercy Corps, will evaluate an alternative approach, which helps young men living in rural and peri-urban Niger plan for migration to neighboring ECOWAS countries to find work. The Planning for Productive Migration (PPM) program informs young men about the opportunities and risks associated with migration to different destinations, facilitates conversations within families around migration, and provides a cash transfer to offset the costs of cross-border travel to stable ECOWAS countries. We benchmark this program against an unconditional cash transfer (UCT) and control condition."
