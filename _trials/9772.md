abstract: "For many government safety net programs, beneficiaries must regularly demonstrate eligibility to avoid losing benefits. The objective of this field experiment is to identify the effect of outreach strategy on beneficiaries’ maintenance of Medicaid enrollment. The topic is timely because an upcoming policy change after the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE) will increase demonstration of eligibility requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries nationwide. The experimental population includes an estimated 168,000 cases (members of a household who applied for Medicaid together) in Wisconsin enrolled in fee-for-service Medicaid who must renew or lose their coverage after the end of the public health emergency. The implementing organization is Covering Wisconsin, the navigator organization contracted by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services to conduct outreach to these beneficiaries. The experimental arms vary a) the modality of outreach message (text, postcard, and/or outbound call), b) the number of outreach messages (1 vs. 2), and c) for text messages, the channel offered to connect with assistance (texting with a chatbot first vs. directly calling a hotline to speak with a navigator). This research will identify novel, scalable outreach methods to help low-income people maintain access to benefits. "
