abstract: "The number of available alternatives in a choice context tends to influence the decision-making process of an individual. The question whether and in what way the size of the choice set influences decision makers has already been tested in numerous experiments. However, not only the number of alternatives has an influence on the decision-making process, but also how this process is structured in the respective context. This study aims to examine whether it makes a difference if individuals are confronted only once or twice with the set of alternatives during the decision-making process without varying the total size of the choice set."
