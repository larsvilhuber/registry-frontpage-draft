abstract: "We propose an experiment to examine how investor characteristics influence access to corporate insiders in U.S. public companies. Despite the well-documented benefits of insider access for investors, the mechanisms governing this access remain unclear. This opacity perpetuates information asymmetries and raises concerns about the fairness and inclusivity of capital markets. Our study will address this gap by providing causal evidence on both the likelihood of securing access and the quality of access granted. Our findings will provide evidence on the potential role discrimination plays in financial markets."
