abstract: "Background/Objective: Job-related stress undermines occupational, personal, and organizational outcomes. Stress symptoms are common among teachers of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and affect the academic progress of the children. This study investigated the effectiveness of Yoga- based cognitive behavioral therapy in reducing occupational stress among teachers of children with autism in Lagos states, Nigeria. 
Methods: The current study adopted a group-randomized waitlist control trial design with pretest, post-test, and follow-up assessments. Participants included 75 teachers of children with autism in public and private special schools in Lagos state. Participants were randomly assigned to Y-CBT (N=33) and waitlist control (WLC) (N=32) groups. The Y-CBT group participated in a 2 hours Y-CBT program weekly for 12 weeks. Three instruments- Demographic Questionnaire, Single Item Stress Questionnaire (SISQ), and Teachers’ Stress Inventory (TSI) were used to collect data. Data were collected at baseline; post-test and follow-up evaluations. Data were analyzed using means, standard deviations, t-test statistics, repeated measures ANOVA, and bar charts. 
Results: Results revealed that all dimensions of job stress (perception of stress sources, stress manifestation, and total TSI scores) reduced significantly at post-test and follow-up assessments among the Y-CBT group, compared to the WLC. 
Conclusion: It was concluded that Y-CBT modalities could help to minimize the perception of stress sources and stress manifestation as well as Total TSI scores among teachers of children with ASD.
