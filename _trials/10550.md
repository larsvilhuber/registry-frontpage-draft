abstract: "The objective of this trial is to investigate the effect of a new digital training method for students with dyslexia, called Doolexia.

Doolexia is a computer based learning program where the students daily, either in school or at home, train with custom reading and spelling exercises. An adaptive algorithm selects exercises to fit the proficiency of the student. A teacher at the school who is also trained to use Doolexia further supports the intervention with at least two weekly lessons throughout the intervention period. Doolexia is developed by Jan Bay Kønig and Peer Kromann Nielsen and pilot tested in eight schools (Kønig & Nielsen, 2021).

We test the effect of Doolexia on students’ spelling and reading proficiency compared to a control group of students at schools providing the usual dyslexic teaching. We conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial (C-RCT) involving approximately 30 schools and 500 students. We randomize at the school level. Schools assigned the treatment group will receive the intervention in January – June 2023 while the control schools teach as usual. The control schools will receive the intervention in August – December 2023.

The intervention period is about 16 weeks. We will also carry out a fidelity study on the students’ use of the computer program, implementation evaluation among the teachers to examine which factors hinder or improve the implementation of the intervention, and a cost analysis to calculate the intervention’s cost-effectiveness."
