abstract: "The scale of fake news and misinformation is constantly growing in our hyper-connected world, which may have grave economic and societal consequences. For example, fake news and rumors can manipulate elections, threaten public health, and hype up (or down) investors leading to artificial market disturbances and instability. Designing appropriate social and economic policies in order to combat fake news and to improve the resilience of individuals, institutions, and markets to misinformation calls for a systematic investigation into the underlying cognitive, psychological, and institutional determinants of the belief in falsehoods and resistance to factual information. In this project, we aim to investigate the role of cognitive ability, overconfidence, and motivated reasoning (due to partisanship, prior issue opinions, and ideology) in the processing of (mis)information in several countries. In addition, we will analyze their role in updating from new  information and the evolution of opinions. "
