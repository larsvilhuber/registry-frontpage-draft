abstract: "We study decision making in duopolistic newsvendor games where two newsvendors compete over inventory and prices. The market has a fixed total demand size but uncertainty in demand allocation. One newsvendor receives high demand and the other low demand, determined either stochastically by chance or strategically by prices. Laboratory experiments are conducted to verify the theoretical predictions. "
