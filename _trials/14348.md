abstract: "In response to anthropogenic climate change, there is an urgent need to transition from unsustainable energy sources, such as oil and coal, to renewable alternatives like wind energy. However, one of the key barriers to the widespread adoption of wind farms is public acceptance, or a lack thereof. The impact of information on shaping public attitudes has been inconsistently explored in the literature. This study investigates whether the provision of information affects attitudes toward wind farms and explores the potential moderating effect of motivated reasoning.

An online experiment with a nationally representative sample of 1,629 individuals in the United Kingdom will be conducted. Respondents will be exposed to different information treatments that vary in both source type (academic journal, newspaper, or tweet) and the congeniality of the message regarding the economic impacts of wind farms. A 3x5 factorial design will be employed to assess how different combinations of information affected attitudes, petition signing behaviour, and donation decisions."
