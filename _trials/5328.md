abstract: "Property taxes are an important source of local government revenue. However, compliance rates can be extremely low in some developing country cities. This project studies the effectiveness of policy measures to influence voluntary tax compliance. We consider a specific type of policy intervention: public disclosure of tax compliance. The central question is "Does public disclosure of tax behaviour raise compliance?". We consider two channels of effect through which disclosure could affect compliance. The first is a direct effect; "Do taxpayers change their compliance behaviour when they know that it will be publicised?", and the second is a knock-on effect; "Do tax payers change their behaviour when they are publicly notified of the behaviour of others?". Further, we compare the relative effectiveness of two different types of disclosure: publicly reporting tax delinquents (shaming) and publicly honoring tax compliers. In theory, shaming delinquents could be less effective than honoring compliance. First, honoring compliers may be more effective in a low-compliance equilibrium because shaming provides a relatively uninformative signal when delinquency is very common. Second, honoring compliers may be more effective at creating positive knock-on effects because reports of compliers raises the visibility of good role models while reports of delinquents could demoralise taxpayers. To study these questions we partner with the Kampala Capital City Authority to randomise variations of their proposed tax reporting scheme. In this experiment treatment notifications are administered by text message to roughly 80,000 unique phone numbers associated with roughly 200,000 tax-owing properties.
