abstract: "This project's general objective is to provide evidence about the main quantitative characteristics of the purchases and contracts of the Uruguayan government in a particular decision-making context, such as the current health crisis. In particular, we want to identify and analyze how citizen monitoring affects the efficiency of spending. Expenditure inefficiency is understood as the systematic deviation of prices paid in comparison with the average paid by all government offices and market prices.
The main research questions that arise around this objective: What are the main characteristics of purchases of the most critical medical inputs to address COVID-19? Are there relevant differences in terms of prices between similar agencies?
