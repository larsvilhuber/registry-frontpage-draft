abstract: "The tech sector faces a challenge in improving gender balance. Various strategies of addressing it has been hypothesized, but we lack empirical evidence of their effectiveness. In this research, we study effectiveness of a targeted training program that helps develop portfolio items that signal skills and practical experience on the probability of finding a job in the tech industry.
