abstract: "This study extends the existing literature on the dynamics of diverse teams by leveraging a natural experiment. It involves college students working in teams on real-world design challenges in a natural setting with heightened incentive. Around 900 students are randomly assigned into teams with varying gender compositions, including all-male, male-majority mixed gender, balanced mixed gender, and female-majority mixed gender configurations. Using administrative and survey data, this study seeks to provide insights into both objective performance metrics and subjective personal experiences."
