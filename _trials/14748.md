abstract: "Over the last two decades, venture competitions have emerged as a prominent phenomenon of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Major competitions like the MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition, MassChallenge, the Hult Prize, and TechCrunch Disruptâ€™s Startup Battlefield have attracted thousands of startups, including companies like Grubhub, Cloudflare, and Akamai Technologies. These contests have provided participants with resources and visibility that have contributed to their growth. Increasingly, universities are hosting competitions that go beyond traditional business plans, rewarding projects aimed at creating both financial value and positive social impact. Investors, experienced entrepreneurs, and industry professionals from diverse networks often serve as judges, bringing varied perspectives to the evaluation of these ventures. However, we know little about how evaluators from differing backgrounds and expertise align or misalign in their assessments of early-stage innovations, what they prioritize given the duo objectives of ventures achieving both financial and social returns, and the consequences of convergent or divergent perceptions among experts in shaping venture success.
