abstract: "We are conducting a study to learn about the effects on social media behavior of interventions that educate social media users about how to identify and avoid sharing misleading information online. To date, studies of these interventions have predominantly used survey outcomes, which are subject to known concerns with experimenter demand effects. We test three previously evaluated interventions to learn whether these interventions also change real-world behavior on social media."
