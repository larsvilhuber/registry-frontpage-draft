abstract: "Lying costs and social preferences are perhaps the two most well-documented deviations from selfish maximization behavior in the economic literature. We hypothesize that in situations where both these motives are present and are in conflict, individuals may in a self-serving way put more weight on the motive that helps them maximize their earnings. We test this hypothesis using a laboratory experiment that allows us to document whether such motivated motive selection is present."
