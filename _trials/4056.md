abstract: "The aim of this trial is to test the effectiveness of messages to improve tax compliance in Papua New Guinea (PNG) in a setting where the threat of punishment from non-compliance lacks credibility. We will test two types of interventions in collaboration with the Internal Revenue Commission (IRC). Firstly, we will test the effects of SMS messages on taxpayer behavior. Two alternative messages will be sent to taxpayers to remind them to lodge their tax return (Treatment Group 1A) and to inform them that their taxes are being used to fund education, healthcare and infrastructure (Treatment Group 2A). A control group will not receive any communication from the IRC over the duration of the trial (Control Group A). Taxpayers are being assigned randomly to the two treatment groups and to the control group. Secondly, we will test the effect of a flyer that is designed to encourage taxpayers to pay their taxes by informing taxpayers that their taxes are being used to fund education and healthcare. Taxpayers that receive a letter from the IRC for notification purposes will be randomly assigned to a group that will receive a letter and a flyer (Treatment Group 1B) and a group that will only receive a letter but no flyer (Control Group B).
