abstract: "The aim of this project is to promote formal employment and job permanence among youth in Mexico. The target population includes youth who are finishing 12th grade in upper-secondary schools of San Luis Potosi, Mexico. The program consists of three main interventions: a labor market information workshop offered to all students in 12th grade, a set of self-affirmation exercises, and a wage subsidy for employment in the formal labor market. We experimentally study the impact of the latter two components on employment outcomes and earnings of targeted youth."
