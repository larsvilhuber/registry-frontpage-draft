abstract: "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has introduced new opportunities for workers to resolve challenges when seeking help in the workplace.  In this study, we aim to examine whether and how workers from lower, middle, and upper social classes influence their help-seeking behaviors from AI in the workplace. In response, this study will collect data on workers' help-seeking choices when facing difficulties in the workplace."
