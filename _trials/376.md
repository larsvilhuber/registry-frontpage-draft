abstract: "Non-cognitive skills, such as motivation, perseverance and self-discipline are increasingly considered to be at least as important as cognitive skills for educational attainment and labor market outcomes. However, a child’s early cognitive and non-cognitive development can be affected by family background and socioeconomic status. Children growing-up in low-income families, with less educated parents, often receive poor stimulation at home. They are more likely to fall behind in school and to drop out compared to their better-off peers.  Investing in the development of non-cognitive skills at school could help close the attainment gap. Yet little evidence exists about the impact of policies that target students’ non-cognitive skills on educational achievement. In this study, researchers investigate the impact of a series of class discussions in middle school that emphasize the importance of these skills on student behavior, test scores, and dropout rates. The goal of this study is to provide empirical evidence on how it is possible to impact non-cognitive skills and how non-cognitive skills may affect cognitive ones and prevent students from an early drop out from school."
