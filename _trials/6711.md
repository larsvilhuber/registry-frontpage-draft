abstract: "This project studies the role of beliefs regarding immigrants' speed of integration for immigration preferences. The recent European migrant crisis and US President Trump’s immigration rhetoric and, in particular, his plan’s on a potential border wall are prominent manifestations of what many scholars, pundits, and lay persons understand to be one of the fundamental challenges of the 21st century: how can Western democracies deal with high levels of immigration? We approach this topic by investigating the determinants of immigration preferences. We conduct a representative survey in Germany and relate immigration preferences to individuals’ beliefs regarding immigrants’ speed of integration pertaining to Germany’s culture and economy. We predict that subjects with more benevolent immigration preferences believe immigrants to integrate quickly, while unfavorable immigration preferences are associated with beliefs of slower integration speed. In further analyses, we seek to investigate whether: (i) certain dimensions of integration (pertaining to Germany’s culture or economy) are more relevant for this relationship between the speed of integration and immigration preferences; (ii) we can uncover interesting between-individual heterogeneity in relation to socioeconomic status and exposure to immigration; (iii) the provision of hard information and anecdotal evidence on the speed of integration causally affects immigration preferences."
