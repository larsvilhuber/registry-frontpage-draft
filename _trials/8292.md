abstract: "Studies of the effectiveness of business training for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in lower income countries have shown mixed results, and it has been challenging to reconcile many of these studies because of how much training and opportunities to use the training in practice differs across research settings. In this study we are providing an additional analysis of the effectiveness of training among SMEs, but the training we are analyzing is one that has been delivered to thousands of SMEs across the developing world and is thus, highly standardized and already being heavily invested in. Moreover, we are testing whether the business training is more or less effective when completion is immediately followed by access to a business loan. The study uses data generated from an RCT run by Technoserve Kenya in early 2021 to evaluate their training program among SMEs through Mombasa and Nairobi. Of the just over 14,000 SMEs that applied to participate in the program, a randomly selected one-third was assigned to receive Technoserveâ€™s standard phone-based training program immediately and receive a loan in the size they applied for immediately afterwards, one-third was assigned to receive the training immediately but not receive the loan they applied for until two months after training, and the final one-third was assigned to receive the training followed by the loan they applied for four months following the training of the first two groups. A random sub-set of each group was surveyed and audited for performance before the initial training began, and three and a half months afterwards. Differences in assets, business practices, and performance across groups will be analyzed, and how these differences vary by business type, intensity of COVID-19 cases, and change in knowledge following training will also be analyzed."
