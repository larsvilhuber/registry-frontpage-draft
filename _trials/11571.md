abstract: "While some individuals may exhibit a strong labor supply response to taxation, this response may not be the same as if these same individuals, rather than being taxed, were working both for themselves and for a charity or political party they support or oppose. We design an experiment that allows us to compare the labor supply response to taxation to the labor supply responses to donating to charities and political parties. In addition, our design allows us to estimate the effect that allowing people to work for organizations they support (or oppose) has on their labor supply. This may have significant implications for policymakers that want to increase tax revenue without causing the negative labor supply response typically associated with taxation."
