abstract: "According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, millions of Americans are throwing out good food because they believe it’s not safe to eat after the date on the package. However, throwing food away after the labeled dates is mainly due to consumers’ misunderstanding, as these dates are not standardized and the labeled food products are usually safe to consume long past these dates. To help address this misunderstanding, some have advocated for standardizing expiration date labels. Three leading options for these labels are: “best if used by”, “use by”, and “expired on”. This research analyzes 1) how the addition of an expiration date label changes consumer preference functions with respect to different production dates of a food product; and 2) how consumers’ willingness to consume the same food product varies with different labeling language.
