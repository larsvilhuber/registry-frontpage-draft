abstract: "Do politicians possess accurate information about citizen preferences and can better information bring politicians' actions closer to citizen preferences? In collaboration with the two largest political parties in Pakistan, I test how accurate local politicians' beliefs are about citizen preferences and conduct interventions aimed at reducing the distance between politician actions and citizen preferences."
