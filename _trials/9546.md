abstract: "This study aims to examine the overall success and cost-effectiveness of business plan competitions (BPC), and to disentangle the importance of different features of BPCs on driving business performance and employment outcomes of female and male youth entrepreneurs in Kenya. The large-scale randomized controlled trial randomly assigns entrepreneurs into receiving business plan support, grants of varying amounts, and screening of business plans. The study is therefore designed to determine whether business plan training can help candidates to win the BPC, whether smaller grants are as effective as larger grants, and whether grants to unscreened businesses are as effective.
