abstract: "In this project, we will study whether information can affect COVID vaccine uptake. Specifically, we experimentally test the effect of two types of informational videos delivered by Black physicians. The first provide information about COVID 19 vaccine information including information on side effects and emergency use authorization.  The second cover aspects relevant to Black populations, e.g.:  whether Black people were involved in the development and testing of the vaccine. We test the effect on attitudes, intentions and vaccination rates. "
