abstract: "Effective communication and technological coordination are critical for successful teamwork. Recent innovations in communication technology have changed the landscape of communication methods among team members in the workplace, making virtual communication increasingly easier. One potential advantage of remote work is it supports more work hour flexibility than on-site jobs do, which many workers prefer. Higher levels of job satisfaction are not only associated with greater worker wellbeing, but also with benefits for organizations through higher labor productivity. Moreover, organizations that offer flexible work schedules may be able to attract workers they otherwise could not afford. However, flexible work hours may also hinder effective coordination and communication. Less frequent and lower quality communication may lead to even larger performance losses over time as these teams will be less likely to overcome initial communication barriers. In this project, we will test the trade-offs to flexible and coordinated team work hours using an online natural field experiment conducted among teams of translators working remotely. In particular, we will randomize hired remote translators into teams and randomize whether they are assigned to work specific overlapping hours, or given flexible work schedules. We then re-hire the same teams for a subsequent translation task, and re-randomize them into flexible or coordinated work time schedules. Importantly, our job advertisements include information on whether the task will have flexible work hours or not. This design allows us to test the effect of flex work hours on the quality of applicants and the performance of teams, and whether this varies depending on whether teams have previously worked together."
