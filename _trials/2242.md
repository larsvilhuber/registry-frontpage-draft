abstract: "We investigte complementarities between T-S ratio and evidence-based practice. 150 schools, with two classes at each school, participate in the trial. We vary treatment in two tiers: 1) increased T-S ratio, and 2) adaption of a program that provides training, tools and guidelines for evidence based teacher practice (Language Track). In the first tier we randomly choose one incoming class at each school as treated and one as control. The treated classes receive an additional teacher in literacy instruction 8 x 45 minutes a week from first through second grade. The control classes receive no additional resources, but we assess student achievements and motivation in the same way as in the treated classes. In the second tier, we randomly choose 50 schools to adapt Language Track, and 50 schools to adapt Language Track with additional instructions for how to use the extra teacher in the treated class. The remaining 50 schools are not asked to do anything to change their instructional approach. 

The two-tiered design allows us to investigate effects of increased T-S ratio, effects of a more evidence-based practice, and complementary effects of a more evidence-based practice and increased T-S ratio. We do all effect analyses on the following domains of measures: : (i.) Students achievement in reading and spelling, (ii) Students literacy interest, reader self-concept and achievement strategies, (iii) Classroom climate and emotional support (iv) Teaching practices in literacy instruction. We will investigate differential intervention effects across parental education, income, immigrant background, gender and pre-intervention competencies.
