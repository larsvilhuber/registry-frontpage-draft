abstract: "Governments in developing countries spend billions every year to promote technological adoption. A neglected but important question is how to effectively motivate the agents hired for such outreach projects, especially as digital extension services become more mainstream. We will conduct an experiment that puts hired agents for a mobile phone-based service into two treatment groups: agents working towards individual goals, and others competing for a share of the group-goal in their locality. The goals are based on the number of users that agents can register for KasuwaGo, an app to help farmers, sellers and resellers to trade with one another. We will compare performance means and dispersion for the two groups by measuring (a) the number of agents that achieve the goals. (b) the time taken to reach the goal, and (c) the number of registered users per agent.. The results could help to improve agricultural extension and other piecework-based programs in developing countries."
