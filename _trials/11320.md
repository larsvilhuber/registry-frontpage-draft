abstract: "This project studies the willingness to engage in district-wide climate adaptation measures through climate community funds. The setting of the research are small scale coastal communities in Bougainville, Papua New Guinea, that suffer from sea-level rise and more frequent natural disasters such as tsunamis, beach erosion, and coastal floodings while at the same time enjoying a high mangrove abundancy. Through a lab-in-the-field experiment, this project studies the willingness to contribute to district-wide community funds devoted to adaptation measures depending on whether the other player is from one’s own community or from another constituency, i.e. another language and cultural group. I further investigate whether the potential out-group discrimination might be alleviated through observation. I hypothesize that while cooperation with the out-group yields lower contribution levels, the effect of being observed by the community’s chief while taking the decision has the opposite effect."
