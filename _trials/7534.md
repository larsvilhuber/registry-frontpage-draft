abstract: "The economic recovery from the COVID-19 crisis in Latin America hinges on the survival of SMEs, which employ a large fraction of the region’s workforce. Governments are responding with large economic stimulus packages, including liquidity or methods to prop up demand for SMEs. We are evaluating the impact of randomly offering loans to SMEs within the framework of the Chilean Government COVID-19 support program. The researchers hope to understand what might be preventing firms from taking up these services and to quantify the impact of pandemic-specific protections and relief on firm profits, survival, and employment."
