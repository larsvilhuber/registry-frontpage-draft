abstract: "We study the role of motivated beliefs in climate change using an online laboratory experiment. Participants in our experiment work on a real effort task and decide between two production technologies. The payments for the technologies depend on a state of nature that is unknown to participants but can be estimated based on a subjective text that discusses climate change. We test whether participants form motivated beliefs about the state of nature when doing so is in their financial interest. We also test whether motivated beliefs impact actions, and whether removing the role of motivated beliefs makes people choose technologies in a more altruistic way."
