abstract: "School-related gender-based violence (SRGBV) can be a barrier to girlsâ€™ education and well-being. This study will assess the impact of the Empowerment Pilot, a school-based safe-space program delivered to secondary school students in Zambia. The main question it aims to answer is whether the Empowerment Pilot decreases adolescents' experience of SRGBV, improves attitudes and norms around gender roles and SRGBV, and increases socio-emotional skills and well-being. We use a mixed-methods triangulation design and combined qualitative and quantitative approaches in data collection and analysis to enhance the validity, depth, and relevance of our findings. We aim to understand whether combining training and support for teachers and a safe space for adolescents can change attitudes and social norms around gender and SRGBV, reduce SRGBV and create a safe school environment necessary for adolescents to achieve their educational goals."
