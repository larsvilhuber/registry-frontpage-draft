abstract: "This research project is a random assignment evaluation of the effects of two variants of a virtual college counseling intervention designed to reduce informational and social support barriers to college application and enrollment among socioeconomically disadvantaged students. The 15-month intervention was implemented by EdBoost Education Corporation, a Los Angeles non-profit education services provider. The intervention began in the spring of studentsâ€™ junior year and involved students from low-income, predominantly poor, non-white high schools in Southern and Central California. Students were randomly assigned to one of two nested variants of the Virtual Student Outreach for College Enrollment (V-SOURCE) intervention. Students in the Milestones variant received access to a comprehensive website; emails and text messages sent several times a month with information tailored to the timing of particular college access activities and reminders about important deadlines, as well as links to relevant content on the website; and $20 electronic gift card rewards for completing four key milestones in the college application process. Students assigned to the Complete variant received everything in the Milestones variant plus access to a personal advisor who communicated with the students through emails, texts, phone, and social media."
