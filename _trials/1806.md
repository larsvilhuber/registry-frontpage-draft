abstract: "The proposed study aims at providing empirical evidence on the effect of large positive income shocks to female household members on decision-making and conflict  dynamics in households. It exploits a randomized control trial carried out for the evaluation of a large education intervention in Uganda. The program has multiple components, including a monthly stipend to the female caretakers of the beneficiaries. We expect the stipend to trigger an increase in the decision involvement of the recipient and a consequent adverse reaction of the male head of the household, resulting in household conflict. The present document outlines the outcome variables and econometric methods we will use to assess the effect of the program.
