abstract: "The first objective of most financial inclusion plans consists in having as many people as possible opening a bank account.  A consecutive important step, for those who opened an account, is to receive payments on that account. 
Due to a statu quo bias, the ‘default option’ may strongly influence human behavior.  For those who receive money on their bank accounts, that money is saved, by default. Unless they take the active step of withdrawing it from their account, their money will stay on the account. On the other hand, we expect people paid in cash to spend their money. Unless they take the active step to deposit it on their account or to freeze it under another form.
Based on that hypothesis, the objective of this study is to test whether moving beyond the first step of opening bank accounts and reaching the second step where people are paid on their accounts indeed substantially increases savings levels. And, if it does, whether that increase can be attributed to the ‘default option’ behavior that we mentioned."
