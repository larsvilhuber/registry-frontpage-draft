abstract: "The turnover of improved crop varieties among smallholder farmers has been slow, and little is known about the drivers of varietal replacement and product substitution. Such low varietal turnover limits the extent to which investments in crop breeding programs can contribute to achieving the sustainable development goals. This cluster randomized trial, implemented in seven counties in Kenya, will therefore generate behavioral intelligence on what drives farmers', consumers' and private-sector decisions to adopt new varieties. Specifically, we will test whether varietal turnover can be accelerated through four interventions:
1) Providing trial packs of new varieties, to provide farmers with the opportunity to test new varieties at a lower cost (randomized at the village level, with additional randomization within villages in terms of who receives trial packs);
2) Providing personalized advisory services, to alleviate information constraints on how to cultivate these new varieties (randomized at the village level, with additional randomization within villages in terms of who is targeted with advisories); 
3) Providing agricultural insurance subsidies, to reduce the financial risk associated with investing in more expensive seeds (randomized at the farmer level, within villages); and 
4) Targeting the same set of farmers with a consumer-oriented intervention that addresses factors related to the taste, texture, nutritious value or other consumer-related characteristics of the final product associated with a new variety (randomized at the village level).

The trial is implemented in 160 villages spread across seven counties in Kenya, with 40 farmers per village recruited into the study. Results are expected to be available by December 2024."
