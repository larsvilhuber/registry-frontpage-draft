abstract: "Personalized Learning Squared (PLUS) is an edtech platform that uses a hybrid human-AI tutoring intervention to boost learning gains for middle school students from historically underserved communities. We know that tutoring works to improve learning, especially among students who are furthest behind. However, tutoring is a fairly resource intensive and expensive intervention. PLUS connects remote, human tutors to students working on math software in classrooms, and uses insights from the math software to identify needs in real time and help tutors allocate their attention between students. This optimizes student gains and provides a scalable solution to increase math learning. PLUS has been operating in classrooms since the 2022-2023 school year. They have been expanding into new schools and districts, improving the PLUS platform as well as their approach to onboarding and supporting teachers and tutors, and evaluating the impact of the PLUS platform iteratively. They plan to conduct a pilot study during the 2024-2025 school year that will continue to test the implementation of the PLUS program as well as the impact on student learning outcomes.
