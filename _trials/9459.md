abstract: "We conduct an experiment to verify the results of a prior experiment using a demographically diverse online subject pool to estimate values for total and extensive price elasticities of giving by religiosity.  After a demographic survey, subjects who report very high or very low religiosity are randomly assigned to a dictator game with amounts sent multiplied by either 0.2 or 2.0, varying effective price of giving."
