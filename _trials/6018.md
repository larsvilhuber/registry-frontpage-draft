abstract: "This experiment aims to assess if tablet-based testing may reduce cheating in large-scale official assessments. This was done in the context of a large testing program, conducted by the Government of Andhra Pradesh with support from Central Square Foundation, in February 2019 which covered all Grade 4 students in all schools in one district (Prakasam) which had more than 5 students enrolled in G4. In two-thirds of the schools, the test was conducted on tablets taken to the school by the Cluster Resource Person. In the remaining third, students were tested on paper-based tests with the answer scripts graded centrally. Students in a subset of schools were tested again with external proctoring, all using paper-based assessments, to provide an external benchmark for comparison for the two treatment arms. The goal of the study is to compare cheating between the two types of test administration (tablet and paper) both using analysis flagging suspicious response patterns and, in a subset of schools, comparison with the external benchmark.
