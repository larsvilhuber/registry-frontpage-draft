abstract: "The goal of this paper is to investigate how people lie in the context of markets with asymmetric information and when lying has varrying intensities in terms of probability of getting caught. Some lies are detectable ex post with certainty, but others guarantee plausible deniability. We look at which market mechanisms affect the amount and types of lies."
