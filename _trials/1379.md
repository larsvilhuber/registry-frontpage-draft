abstract: "While there is increasing evidence that enhancing the communication between schools and parents significantly improves students’ performance, less is known about what mechanisms drive those effects. Is it because, by providing parents with information about their children’s effort, communication primarily alleviates the moral hazard problem between parents and children (Burztyn and Coff, 2008)? Or is it because parents have limited attention, and communication makes parenting “top of mind”?  This paper attempts to decompose the effects of communicating with parents into those two mechanisms. Specifically, we investigate whether informing parents about their children’s attendance, lateness and assignment completion, improves students’ outcomes above and beyond the effects of communication aimed at increasing awareness about those dimensions of children’s effort. The distinction matters: providing timely and accurate information about children’s behavior requires integrated systems and customized communication, which can be quite costly, particularly in developing countries. Conversely, simply nudging to raise awareness does not require any information systems in place.
