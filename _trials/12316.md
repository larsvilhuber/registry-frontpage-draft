abstract: "By 2030, about 60% of the world’s population is projected to live in urban areas. With cities consuming about three-quarters of global natural resources and energy consumption and being responsible for 70% of global CO2 emissions (Gurney et al. 2015; UN-Habitat 2021), they significantly contribute to climate change, but are at the same time most vulnerable to climate change (Rosenzweig et al. 2010). Nature-based solutions such as urban green and blue infrastructures  present opportunities for sustainable urbanization, as well as climate mitigation and adaption in urban areas (Martos et al. 2016). Among these, urban forests  have the greatest mitigation potential (Lwasa et al. 2022) while also providing substantial co-benefits that facilitate climate adaptation in cities and make living in urban areas more pleasant. Accurately determining the values associated with city trees is crucial for the effectiveness and targeting of tree planting programs (Li 2023) and can ultimately increase a community’s resilience to various climate change-related stresses. To now, there is a limited understanding of the publics' valuation of city trees and the services they provide. To account for this, this study employs a stated choice experiment (CE) to investigate the assessment of diverse urban afforestation programs, aiming to differentiate the values assigned by participants to various aspects of these programs. In particular, the choice experiment enables the differentiation of values attributed by participants to the climate mitigation potential of trees (carbon sequestration) compared to other co-benefits (heat island reduction and increased biodiversity), as well as potential land use conflicts (loss of parking or residential housing space). Therewith, this research fills an important knowledge gap by providing a nuanced understanding of how individuals assess and prioritize diverse aspects of urban afforestation programs. The findings will help to inform sustainable urban planning strategies that balance climate change mitigation, environmental benefits, and potential drawbacks, ultimately leading to more effective and socially acceptable urban afforestation programs."
