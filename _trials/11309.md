abstract: "In this paper, we investigate how voting and electoral outcomes impact voters' evaluations of politicians. A few hypotheses are tested. First, chosen preference theory predicts that the act of voting could lead to a more favorable opinion of the supported candidate in the future in order to resolve internal dissonance. Second, we apply motivated belief in the context of voting. Winning an election is interpreted by voters as evidence that confirms the correctness of their vote. However, losing an election is not calculated the same way. Finally, stronger echo chambers may form among friends and religious groups after their supported candidate wins. "
