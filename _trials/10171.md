abstract: "The current study investigates the impacts of the embedded-ethics software coding education program with a sample of 200 students in Arusha Girls’ Secondary School in the United Republic of Tanzania. The study randomly assigns the sample into two treatment groups - one where students code interactions of virtual “Standard Nash” agents that only take account of the benefit to oneself, and another where the students code interactions of virtual “Altruistic-Equitable” agents that are interested in not only one’s own benefit but also others’ - and a control group for which no program activities are taken place. Through such random assignment to the intervention, this study plans to study the impact of the embedded-ethics digital education program on students’ i)  social preferences in altruism, equity, and inclusion, ii) psychosocial well-being, and iii) other auxiliary socioemotional-learning indicators, such as their interest in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields and gender-based attitudes.
