abstract: "The present project is a follow-up to a large-scale experiment designed to elicit people's preferences regarding the distribution of educational resources in society. The experiment was pre-registered at the AEA RCT registry prior to data collection (AEARCTR-0002615). The present pre-analysis plan should be read as an addition to the former pre-analysis plan. The present pre-analysis plan presents additional data sources and a follow-up vignette study."
