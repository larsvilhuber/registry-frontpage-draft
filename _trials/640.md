abstract: "This study seeks to measure the impact and cost effectiveness of Espacios para Crecer (EpC), or Room to Grow, a strategy for improving school attachment and early grade reading in a region that is poor, rural, isolated, economically unstable, and populated by ethnic and linguistic minorities. In these areas, the school day is often short, attendance is sporadic, and enrollment by school-age children is not universal. The EpC is a half-day after-school program with monthly "school for parents" meetings. The EpC program targets at-risk children of primary school age that have not passed 3rd grade at the time of eligibility and provides them with enrichment activities that include academic instruction, self-esteem-building, physical play, and other mechanisms to strengthen children's connection to formal school. 

The study will follow children for two years, including both a program group and a randomized control group, conducting household surveys and individual assessments of literacy skills.
