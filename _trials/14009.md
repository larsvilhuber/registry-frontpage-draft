abstract: "Structural transformations caused by globalization and technological change substantially alter the rewards for different skills in the labor market. The shift in the valuation of skills and the resulting skill-biased inequality are, therefore, often determined by external market forces, a phenomenon we refer to as market luck. In meritocratic societies, inequalities are typically considered justifiable only when they stem from individual effort and not from factors beyond an individual's control. This raises the question of whether individuals perceive inequalities arising from market luck as fair. To answer this question, we design an experiment where inequality between workers with different skills emerges because they are matched with a buyer who requires a specific skill. We collected data on redistributive choices from nearly 2,000 Americans. This study replicates the main experimental treatment with participants from an online sample in France. "
