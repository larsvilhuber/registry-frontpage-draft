abstract: "This study examines whether Zodiac predictions on marital compatibility affect spouse preferences in China. We conduct an experiment where participants are invited and incentivized to rate profiles of potential spouses with randomly assigned Zodiac and other traits. We also elicit participants' demographic characteristics, socioeconomic background, attitudes, and beliefs regarding the Zodiac culture.
