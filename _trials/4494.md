abstract: "In this project, we compare frequently used proxies for unethical behavior in the economics laboratory. Subjects in our experiment first face an individual moral decision and then a group moral decision that requires agreement of all group members. In both decision frameworks, subjects choose between monetarily dominated “ethical” options and monetarily beneficial but “unethical” options. Treatments vary if moral costs of the “unethical” option are introduced (i) by generating a donation to a negatively perceived charity or (ii) by preventing a donation to a positively perceived charity."
