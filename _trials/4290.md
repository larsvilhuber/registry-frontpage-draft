abstract: "This project aims to improve our understanding of job search behaviour for young job seekers in Egypt. We aim to study the different job searching strategies that job seekers employ, how job fairs currently factor into their job search behaviour and if job fairs can be a more useful tool for them. To do this we will determine and explore which are the main constraints that are currently leading to low utilization of job fairs. In particular, we are interested in estimating the impact of general information frictions (do job seekers know about the existence of jobs fairs and how to participate in them?), labor market information frictions (what types of jobs are available in jobs fairs and the labor market more broadly), and capital constraints (how do the monetary costs of attending a job fair impact participation).
