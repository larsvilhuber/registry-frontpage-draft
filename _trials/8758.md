abstract: "We will design a survey experiment testing the effect of four different information messages on financial and political support of recovery housing and recovery housing stigma, that vary in the perceived social distance of those in recovery housing. We will test one data-heavy message that describes the effectiveness of recovery housing in improving outcomes relating to substance use, mental health, criminal justice involvement, and employment. We will also test three contact-based interventions each telling the same story with varying anonymity of the storyteller. In one contact intervention, the story of an individual who benefited from recovery housing will be told, but no identifying information about the individual will be given. In the second contact intervention, the same story will be told, and the individualâ€™s name will be given to participants. In the third contact intervention, the participants will be shown a video of the individual telling their story. We will test these interventions in a nationally representative U.S. sample (N=2,000), with oversampling of rural populations to ensure heterogenous treatment effects across rural and non-rural areas can be detected.
