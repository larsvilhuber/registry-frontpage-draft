abstract: "Corruption has long been one of the major obstacles to improving economic efficiency and reducing poverty in developing countries. In many places, corruption has become a norm - a way of life - something that is generally accepted as a behavioural standard. How do we change a corrupt norm? The aim of this project is to devise an innovative policy intervention to address this question. We focus on Ghanaian traffic police because it is relatively understudied and the relationship between the traffic police and citizens is a complex one. However, the high frequency of interactions between citizens and traffic police officers means that it is more visible than other forms of corruption. In Ghana, traffic officers are known to either purposely create roadblocks to extort bribes from drivers or to reduce the number and/or the frequency of checks on smugglers/traffickers in exchange for various sums of money (National Road Safety Commission, 2010, 2015). However, ethnographic research has also revealed that citizens who violate the traffic laws often initiate the payment to avoid a court order which is typically a very cumbersome process and time consuming. The aim of our paper is to first gain a better understanding of the organisational culture of the police service, the working environment, and obstacles that police officers face. In particular, we are interested in the role of intrinsic motivations in driving corrupt behaviour. Our conjecture is that if we can increase intrinsic motivation among police officers by instilling a new identity, new mission that they can internalise and identify with, the moral cost of engaging in corruption will increase and thus, they are more likely to refrain from taking/asking for a bribe. Our main treatment is an innovative and intensive identity-building training programme, which uses psychological and team-building exercises to re-shape the officers' social identity and values. We will be working with a training expert from the Brazil's Federal Highway Police to deliver the training to the treatment group of 350 traffic police officers in Ghana. "
