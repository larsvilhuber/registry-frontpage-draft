abstract: "The primary objective of the study was to determine whether credit and family planning programs â€“ together - have a larger impact on contraceptive use than either program operating on its own. By design, the program also assigned a random subset of the study areas to receive access to micro-loans. This study analyzes the impact of increased access to micro-loans on income-generating activities, labor supply, school attendance, women's empowerment and other indicators of socio-economic status."
