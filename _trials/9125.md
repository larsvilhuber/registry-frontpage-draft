abstract: "In collaboration with the Ministry of Housing and up to five municipalities in Peru, we will conduct an experiment to evaluate whether variations in the implementation of the building safety-regulation can improve state's capacity and safety and reduce leakages. Most firms require multiple visits to obtain the safety certificate and start operations, creating inefficiencies and opportunities for rent-seeking. Constraints identified in this system include high discretion in the application of the regulation and low capacity to enforce the regulation by municipalities in charge of the implementation. We are rolling out an electronic inspection system and will assess the impact of increasing inspector accountability through random audits."
