abstract: "The objective of this RTC is to gain a better understanding of the impact of gender identity norms on intra-household financial decision making in a controlled environment. Going beyond what would be possible in a typical observational study, the experimental methodology allows causal identification of any gender effects. Specifically, in a laboratory setting, I am able to exogenously increase the salience of gender identity to subjects. Meanwhile, I can also exogenously allocate the decision power between spouses. These experimental features are almost impossible to achieve in the real-world setting. 

Specifically, this RTC enables me to test two specific channels through which gender identity may impact intra-household financial decision making. One hypothesis is that women are themselves less likely to contribute their ideas due to the traditional gender norms at the information contribution stage of intra-household financial decision making. The other is that women's influence in downplayed by their husband at the information aggregation stage."
