abstract: "Our project investigates whether a simple decision guidance can help managers to achieve more equitable reward decisions. We study this question in partnership with a large software company that wants to strengthen equity considerations in the annual salary planning process. We evaluate the decision guidance using a Randomized Controlled Trial. In the treatment groups, the guidance is implemented into the software tool used by managers when they determine the annual salary increases. It provides a proposed merit increase value for each of the managers' team members. Post-experimental surveys and operational data from the company records (including, e.g., other reward instruments or utilization rates of consultants) complement our experimental data on managers' decision-making about merit increases.
