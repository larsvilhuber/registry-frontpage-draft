abstract: "I study strategic bidding behaviour in three pay-as-bid multi-object auctions: a Product-Mix auction, a sequential auction, and a simultaneous auction. In a theoretical model, bidders are assumed to behave optimally, i.e. are maximising their expected surplus. This model predicts that, in equilibrium, the Product-Mix and the sequential format perform nearly identically with respect to bidder surplus, revenue, and welfare. The simultaneous auction, however, performs slightly worse than the other two formats. I test if these predictions hold up in a virtual lab experiment. I consider a bidding environment identical to the theoretical model of an asymmetric market, but also study a bidding environment with symmetric bidders, a more general setting for which current Bayes-Nash equilibrium models cannot make predictions."
