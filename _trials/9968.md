abstract: "Using data from an incentivized online survey with gender-balanced U.S. citizens, I study the role of induced merit identity and induced luck group identity on individuals' redistribution decisions for others as third-parties. The objective of this project is three-fold. First, I aim to test if induced merit group identity and induced luck group identity will affect individualsâ€™ reallocation decisions. If so, I aim to scrutinize if stronger in-group identification will lead to larger in-group bias. Second, I aim to further investigate the heterogeneous effects of different group identities. In particular, I aim to test if group identities induced by exogenous factors will lead to less in-group bias than group identities induced by discretionary factors. I also aim to test if positively distinctive group identities will result in more in-group bias. For example, high merit group identities may lead to more in-group bias than low merit group identities; lucky group identities may lead to more in-group bias than neutral group identities. Third, I aim to examine whether the induced-group identities can affect the fairness attitude distribution in the sample."
