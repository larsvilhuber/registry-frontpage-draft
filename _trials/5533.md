abstract: "We conduct a randomized experiment providing local and customized search guidance to jobseekers on an online job portal in India. The central aim of the project is to understand whether and how this information provision influences job search strategies and labor market outcomes. Specifically, we provide jobseekers with two types of information-- callback rates and measures of relative ability-- at the local market level, which is defined as the city and job category of search for individual jobseekers. We follow these jobseekers over a period of 2-3 months and use a combination of ‘click data’ from the portal and survey data to measure impacts on labor market outcomes. 

UPDATE: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the timeline and the treatments were changed. This registration has been updated to reflect these changes. The new treatments varied information on number of new vacancies and their attributes, number of applicants and their attributes, and a combination of the two.
