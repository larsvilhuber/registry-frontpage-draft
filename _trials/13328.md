abstract: "This project aims to investigate the impact of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) practices on early childhood development in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with a focus on Indian slums. Recognizing the profound influence of early developmental experiences on human capital formation, the research focuses on early childhood interventions and habit formation techniques that can taught at an early age. This initiative involves three interlinked phases: an exploration of practices and norms in Indian slums, identifying and teaching habit formation techniques to suit these contexts, and a meticulous evaluation using a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) methodology. The research cohort consists of 2,000 mother-child dyads from the district of Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, India. Interventions are designed to raise awareness and induce behavior change in WASH practices, with one group additionally receiving hands-on habit formation interventions. The project's analytical framework blends individual-level and slum-level variables to understand the causal effects of these interventions on child and maternal outcomes.
