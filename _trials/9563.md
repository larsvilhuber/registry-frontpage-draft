abstract: "Public-private partnerships (PPPs) have the potential to expand the supply of high-quality education in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), fostering economic development by building human capital and creating more equitable access to effective schools. PPPs in this context typically consist of private providers educating low-income students, sometimes using public infrastructure, according to a contract with the government that stipulates performance criteria. While much is known about the operation and performance of such partnerships in high-income countries, such as charter schools in the United States, evidence from LMICs is scarce. This project leverages centralized assignment of students to schools in Colombia and rich data on both student backgrounds and outcomes to understand if and how PPPs generate benefits in a LMIC setting, focusing on both cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes. The findings will inform the design and implementation of PPPs not only in Colombia, but more broadly, where governments wish to expand the supply of high-quality education in low-income settings."
