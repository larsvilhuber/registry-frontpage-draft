abstract: "In developing countries, financial transfers within social and kin networks are ubiquitous and frequent (Banerjee and Duflo, 2006). This project asks whether the potential welfare benefits of such transfers come at an important efficiency cost. We conceptualize redistributive arrangements as a tax on earnings. We design an intervention with piece-rate factory workers that makes it easier to convert earnings increases into long-run savings that can be retained by workers using an illiquid savings instrument. We examine how this intervention affects labor supply, earnings, and output. We augment this with additional tests to rule out confounds, such as self-control problems. "
