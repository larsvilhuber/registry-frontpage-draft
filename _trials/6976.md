abstract: "In response to the broad and devastating economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on households, the national government of Colombia developed and implemented a new cash transfer program, Ingreso Solidario, to provide assistance to vulnerable households that were not beneficiaries of any program in the Colombian safety net. To lower transaction costs and avoid personal contact that could contribute to the spread of the coronavirus, the government is turning to mobile money or electronic transfers to bank accounts or digital wallets as safe, secure, and efficient modes of payment. In addition to these logistical benefits and lower transaction costs, the large-scale usage of digital modes of delivering cash transfers may lead to benefits for households. Many households without prior access to a formal financial institution will be introduced to formal digital payments and interact with a formal financial institution for the first time.

We will use a randomized encouragement design to study the impact of financial inclusion through simplified digital accounts on households’ financial outcomes, formal employment, and usage of health services using a combination of administrative records and survey data. In particular, our intervention will provide information on the benefits of digital accounts, step-by-step assistance in opening accounts, and basic training on the primary features of the digital platforms. We will identify the impact of opening simplified digital financial accounts and using them to digitally receive cash transfers on households’ savings, consumption, mode of spending, inter-household transfers, and use of formal financial products, as well as on formal employment and usage of health services. To quantify the short-term effects of transitioning from cash payments to direct deposit into digital accounts, we will analyze data while study participants are still recipients of program transfers. To analyze whether the transition has long lasting effects, we will measure outcomes after the emergency cash-assistance program is discontinued in June 2021.
