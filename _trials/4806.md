abstract: "Worldwide, 2.8 million people die each year as a result of being overweight and contrary to popular opinion, nearly 80% of deaths by noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) occur in LMICs (WHO, 2010). To date, research on obesity mostly focuses on high income countries. Yet, there are reasons to believe that perceptions and characteristics of obesity might differ substantially in high and low income countries.
Among the differences, it has been observed that in LMICs  - in contrast to high income countries - body mass correlates positively with socioeconomic status (WHO, 2010; Subramanian et al., 2011). 

I hypothesise that, in line with a representativeness model of stereotypes, high body mass might be perceived as signal of wealth in LMICs. 
I investigate this hypothesis with a survey experiment in a low-income country context, the urban area of Kampala in Uganda. In the experiment, to get at the causal effect of body mass, I randomly assign body mass exploiting photo-morphed portraits.

In the first part of the survey, respondents are shown a set of portraits and rate them in terms of wealth and other relevant characteristic. This setting allows to test if in the absence of reliable information on wealth - high body mass increases the likelihood of being perceived wealthy. To investigate the mechanism, the design varies the amount of information provided on wealth of the hypothetical individuals. In a second step, I investigate perceived returns to high body mass. I focus on access to credit and elicit respondents' implicit and explicit beliefs on returns to high body mass. I compare individuals' expectations of returns to high body mass with the actual rates of body mass discrimination. In a third part, I elicit expected beliefs on healthy behaviours. In a third part, I elicit nutritional knowledge and explicit beliefs on returns to high body mass.
