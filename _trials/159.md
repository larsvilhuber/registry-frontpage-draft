abstract: "This study measures the impact of providing credit to SMEs, examining both the direct effects on recipient firms and the spillovers on competitors and suppliers.  Lack of access to finance remains a core challenge to small firm growth in developing countries. Many SMEs have high returns to capital but if banks cannot identify those borrowers, they may restrict lending or misallocate funds, in turn limiting production and employment growth. Many developing countries do not have credit bureaus or other effective public systems that aggregate information valuable for screening, further exacerbating the challenge of identifying high return borrowers.  We evaluate a new credit scoring system implemented by the Development Bank of the Philippines to process its SME loans. The randomized design generates exogenous variation in access to credit among loan applicants, enabling us to measure the impact of credit on SMEs.  An important and innovative aspect of this evaluation is its focus on vertical and horizontal spillovers. Firms operate in a web of competitors and suppliers, and providing credit to a single business is likely to have spillover effects on other firms and on consumers.  Classic theories of economic development stress the importance of these linkages in the takeoff to development."
