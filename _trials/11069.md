abstract: "Using a randomized conjoint survey set-up, we study political views of young people ahead of the 2023 parliament elections in Finland. We are particularly interested in young people's views on the political challenges of the future. As a comparison groups we have older adult populations and the candidates of the parliament election. We link the respondent's socio- economic characteristics as well as their societal views and media use in their political views."
