abstract: "This study will conduct an experiment investigating if time pressure on important standardized tests that are used in admissions decisions (the SAT math test and the GRE Quantitative Reasoning test) has differential impacts by gender. If so, tight time constraints may serve as an artificial barrier that prevents qualified women from advancing in STEM careers.

Student subjects take exams under two different time conditions: the normal time allowed on the exam, and 50 percent extended time. We then estimate whether easing time pressure has a bigger impact on the test scores of women than men, and see how easing time pressure affects how men and women rank on the test, particularly in the upper part of the distribution."
