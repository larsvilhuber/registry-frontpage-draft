abstract: "Individuals rely on disclosed information to take most of their purchasing decisions. Information about products can be revealed in various ways, including labeling or advertising, but usually provides some evidence of the truth. When information is very precise, individuals have little room to interpret information in self-serving ways. In contrast, when information is vague or absent, individuals have some wiggle room to form the belief they favor about products. For example, they may form the belief that some products are not so detrimental for health or for the environment. 

We design an experiment in which subjects have to guess the ethical, environmental or ethical quality of real products. Subjects do so after having either won or not won these products in a competition. We design a labeling technology which is such that there are two ways for subjects to interpret the absence of informative label on a product: either the quality is too low, or the quality is good but the label simply got lost for exogenous reasons. In the lab, we vary exogenously the probability with which good labels can be lost, as a way to leave more or less room to subjects for a motivated interpretation of no information. We investigate whether owners and non-owners of products interpret the lack of information in significantly different ways, with a more positive interpretation by the formers. We analyze whether the difference in interpretation gets larger when there is more room for positive interpretation. "
