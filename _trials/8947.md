abstract: "The National Police of Colombia wants to raise their public trust and legitimacy by following procedural justice protocols in citizen-police day-to-day interactions. In our context, procedural justice refers to the idea of fairness in police decisions and interactions with citizens. We partnered with the Police to test an information campaign with police patrols across five Colombian cities: Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Cali, Cartagena and Medellín---the largest Colombian cities excluding the capital Bogotá. The experimental sample consists of 351 police quadrants---a police patrolling area akin to a police beat. We randomly assigned quadrants to: (i) intensified interactions with citizens plus procedural justice instructions; (ii) intensified interactions with citizens plus procedural justice instructions, with the addition of an information campaign on procedural justice values; or (iii) neither. To randomize quadrants into treatment arms, we stratified by city, poverty level, and baseline public trust. We will measure impacts on police beliefs and public trust. Because patrolling areas are relatively large, we collect data on one street block within the quadrant, and ask police patrols to target it as a "pilot" block. We randomly sampled "pilot" street blocks within quadrants.

Note: We updated the abstract after the intervention finished, but not as an ex-post change. The intervention evolved after we registered the PAP, and this is a more accurate description of what the intervention effectively was."
