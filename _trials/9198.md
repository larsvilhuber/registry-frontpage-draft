abstract: "This study tests whether the effects of redistribution on effort depend on how redistribution is framed. There are redistribution schemes that provide identical incentives in the sense that they result in the same disposable or net income for an agent with any given gross income. Yet, the idea has been proposed that framing affects incentives. In particular, universal basic income (UBI) is theorized to result in lower labor supply as the transfer is presented as unconditional in comparison to an equivalent negative income tax (NIT). Using a between-subject design, this RCT tests this hypothesis using a repeated real-effort experiment in which subjects receive payment for their performance, pay taxes, receive transfers, and invest in education that increases their payments. The two treatments result in the same net income for any distribution of gross income levels. The real-effort task is done in five periods. Before each, the subjects can undertake an educational investment. The choice is binary. If they choose 'yes', their reward increases for each subsequent period, however, they have less time available in that period to complete tasks. In that time, they can read materials that are related to how to improve their performance. The second hypothesis tests the claim of proponents of UBI that UBI increases investment in human capital.
