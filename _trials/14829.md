abstract: "Rapidly evolving labor markets have led to deteriorating employment opportunities for workers with few or obsolete skills, and increasing labor and skills shortages for employers. This has led to a growing mismatch between the available jobs and the qualifications of workers seeking employment. As a result, reskilling the workforce is becoming an essential strategy to address these challenges. 

Our project investigates whether jobseekers are willing to reskill and, if so, what this decision depends on. We will explore this question with a discrete choice experiment implemented with the Public Employment Service (PES) operating in Wallonia, Belgium. Using responses from approx. 3,000 Belgian jobseekers, we will explore their willingness to enroll in demand-driven occupational training programs, assess their willingness-to-pay (WTP) for different training features, and compare these preferences with those for job-related characteristics. Our study will thus focus on the importance of key policy-relevant factors, as well as the importance of working conditions in the target occupation, in explaining the decision to reskill. Moreover, we will examine whether jobseekers' willingness to reskill (and their WTP for different training and job features) depends on: their interest in and beliefs about the target occupation, the distance between their target occupation and previous work experience, as well as other personal characteristics. By linking survey data with administrative records, we will be able to relate jobseekers' stated preferences to their actual training decisions. "
