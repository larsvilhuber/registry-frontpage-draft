abstract: "In this project, we investigate whether people’s support of a behavioral policy depends on the psychological mechanism by which it affects behavior. We implement an online-survey experiment among a representative sample of adults aged 18 to 69 years in Germany. Each subject is randomly assigned to one of ten experimental groups, and completes three consecutive stages. In stage 1 all subjects are asked whether they support training for the unemployed. In stage 2 all subjects are presented with a vignette of an unemployed individual, who is informed by letter that the Federal Employment Agency registered him for a training course and that he has two weeks to object to his registration, and is otherwise obliged to participate. Depending on the treatment, subjects learn in the vignette that he participated in the training with (i) no further information given to the subjects, (ii) because he did not read the letter and hence did not know that he could opt out, (iii) because he thought due to his registration that the training would help him to find a new job faster, (iv) because he felt socially pressured to participate in the training, (v) with no further information, except that the individual was undecided whether to participate, (vi) because he did not know that he could opt out and that he was undecided whether to participate, (vii) because he did not know that he could opt out due to no fault of his own and that he was undecided whether to participate, (viii) because he thought due to his registration that the training would help him to find a new job faster and that he was undecided whether to participate, (ix) because he felt socially pressured to participate in the training and that he was undecided whether to participate, (x) or because he felt socially pressured to participate since he thought society would expect him to and that he was undecided whether to participate. All subjects are then asked to report their level of agreement with the described procedure. Stage 3 elicits subjects’ beliefs about whether the procedure (i) restricts the freedom of those that are unemployed, (ii) influences the beliefs about the effectiveness of the course for finding employment, (iii) exerts social pressure on those that are unemployed, (iv) increases the chances of unemployed to find back into paid employment, and (v) is welfare-enhancing for the unemployed."
