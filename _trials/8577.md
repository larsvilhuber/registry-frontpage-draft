abstract: "The study deals with the effects of increased girls’ school attendance on the allocation of unpaid work within the household. Unpaid work includes activities such as water fetching, child and elderly care, collecting firewood or farming, which are normally taken care of by women and girls in the family. In collaboration with a newly-opened school in India, I employ a randomized control trial to answer the following research question: once a girl starts going to school, is there an intra-household self-regulation mechanism which is activated to redistribute housework among family members, or does the time spent at school simply add up to the girl’s time spend on housework? 
The study is conducted in India, where the gap that separates men and women in time spent on unpaid work is the largest in the world (OECD 2021). The focus is on rural Jaisalmer, Rajasthan, the state reporting the lowest female school attendance in India, 72.1%, for girls between 15-17 years (Government of India, 2012). Moreover, the district of Jaisalmer among all districts of Rajasthan has the lowest female literacy rate, 39.7% (Census, 2011) and the lowest girls’ enrollment at Upper Primary Level, 35.89% (NUEPA, 2018).
