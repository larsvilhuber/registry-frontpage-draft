abstract: "Subjectively evaluating employees is a difficult and necessary part of businesses. Because of the difficulty and expense of evaluating employees and the increase in artificial intelligence (AI) technology, firms are looking towards higher tech solutions. Firms are now investing in big data collection that feeds AI algorithms in order to judge the performance of their employees (BasuMallick 2019; Fisher 2019; Pawar 2019). Understanding how employees react to these judgements and the use of this technology is an increasingly important subject. We use a laboratory study to evaluate how employeesâ€™ future effort choices are affected by the use AI to evaluate them. "
