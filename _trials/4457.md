abstract: "It is of public interest that students achieve high returns from public education and perform well in exams. In a field experiment, I study the impact of randomized pre-exam test feedback on exam performance in an undergraduate macroeconomic class. Before and after the test participants reveal beliefs regarding their individual effort-performance relationship. Only students in the treatment group receive feedback on their performance in the test before the second belief elicitation. In addition, I elicit students’ self-confidence regarding their performance in the test. I can measure each student’s consecutively exerted study effort by tracking her activity on the e-study platform. Finally, I link the experiment and platform data to the students’ exam grades. In doing so, I can examine to what extent the exogenous feedback treatment shifted students’ believed effort-performance relationship, their exerted study effort and their final exam performance."
