abstract: "This project investigates (i) how socio-economic inequalities arise because ability signals received differ by parental background conditional on true ability; (ii) how socio-economic inequalities arise because of differences in the interpretation of ability signals leading to differences in educational and occupational decision-making; (iii) the extent to which access to a high SES role model reduces inequalities of opportunity caused by differences in obtained signals or their interpretation."
