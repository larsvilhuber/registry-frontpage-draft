abstract: "Road infrastructures have limited capacity and need to be used more sustainably in the future, satisfying diverse and variable demands. We, therefore, explore the concept of adaptive infrastructures and flexible usage patterns of roads. For this purpose, we have created various scenarios in computer simulations, which have then been explored by experimental subjects in a three-dimensional virtual reality setting using VR glasses. Based on their feedback, we assess what scenarios are more or less promising for the future organisation of urban mobility."
