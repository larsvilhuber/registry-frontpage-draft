abstract: "In this project, I study the impact of a popular US radio show on consumer behavior. The project consists of two parts. In the first part, I document that the radio show causally affects consumption choices using evidence from a large household scanner panel. In the second part, I conduct a survey experiment to shed light on some of the mechanisms underlying behavioral change.

This pre-registration concerns only the second, experimental part of the project, which I outline in more detail in the analysis plan.
