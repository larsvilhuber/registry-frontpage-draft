abstract: "This project investigates how information interventions affect decision-making in risky contexts: are recipients becoming more deliberate decision-makers or are they being pushed to a particular option? To what extent can missing insurance markets be explained by pessimism versus lack of knowledge? I implement two interventions on the demand for climate-based index insurance and its welfare implications when facing heterogeneity in expected benefit, risk exposure, and preferences. Crucially, participants make repeated insurance decisions for products with varying contract terms but with a fixed cost. This means some products are free money, while others will never pay. I hypothesize two possible channels through which information interventions affect demand: deliberative competence and push effects. The former predicts demand becomes more responsive to changes in expected benefit for each product, approximating the full-information benchmark. The latter can result in increased demand for all products, regardless of characteristics."
