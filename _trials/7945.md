abstract: "Gender occupational segregation, one of the main explanation of gender wage gap (Cortes and Pan, 2018), is still strongly present across most economies. Stagnation of gender inequality in labor markets raise questions. One of them is whether sticky gender norms and inter-generational transmission of these norms affect observed gender differences. We conducted a vignette experiment in which subjects were advising fictional character in a job choice. Characters, as subjects were informed, have already received an advice from a parent or Internet occupational advisor. 

We find that subjects are in general more likely to follow an advice , but less likely to advise male-typed offer if the advisor is a parent. Also subjects with more traditional gender norms are less likely to advice risky, competitive and inflexibly, but better paid offers."
