abstract: "Can attitudes towards immigrants change as a result of simple, low-cost interventions? In this document we lay out the design of a large-scale online survey experiment that intends to modify attitudes towards migrants in nine Latin American and Caribbean countries. Our study will test the efficacy of two different interventions: an informational video attempting at correcting misperceptions about the size and characteristics of the migrant population and an emotional video attempting at generating compassion towards migrants. We hope the results of this study will draw lessons useful for governments in the region in the design of programs to foster social cohesion."
