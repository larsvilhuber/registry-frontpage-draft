abstract: "I study how consumers respond to nutritional labels with different levels of granularity.
The study is motivated by the fact that public authorities often adopt simple categorical labels. These labels convey information and promote healthy, ethical, or energy-friendly behavior.  Empirical and experimental literature has shown that these coarse labels can have a significant impact on consumers. On the other end, Information theory (starting from Blackwell 1951) predicts that consumers would learn more, and be better off, if regulators used granular labels (more detailed) instead of coarse labels (e.g., high vs. low score). This prediction relies on consumers being able to understand and process equally well the label information both when it is coarse and detailed. Boundedly rational consumers might be able to process coarse information, but not detailed one, and for this reason might be better off with coarse labels.
In this project, I focus on food choice and I study how consumers respond to different labels. I plan to conduct an online field-framed experiment in which I manipulate the granularity of the nutritional information provided to the decision maker. 
Each participant will complete a series of incentivized choices between packaged food products, with the opportunity of receiving one of the selected products. The design allows comparing the healthiness of consumer choices under different labeling regimes, and test whether consumers make healthier choices when more detailed information is provided. If consumers have limited capacity to process detailed labels, they will be responsive to coarse information, but less responsive when the information is detailed.
Finally, I collect separately individual preferences over levels of calories. I combine product choices and declared preferences to study whether detailed information improves the choices, after controlling for individual preferences."
