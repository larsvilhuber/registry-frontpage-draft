abstract: "Teachers in developing countries have low levels of knowledge of their course material, have less education and training, spend less time on instruction, and have high levels of absence relative to their developed country counterparts. Can we identify and select better teachers to improve the delivery of education? Using a cluster randomized controlled trial, we propose to evaluate the introduction of a teacher entrance exam designed to increase the content-knowledge of primary school teachers in Madagascar. "
