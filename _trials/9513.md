abstract: "We examine how the evaluation of research studies in economics depends on
whether a study yielded a null result. Studies with null results are perceived to
be less publishable, of lower quality, less important, and less precisely estimated
than studies with significant results, even when holding constant all other study
features, including the precision of estimates. The null result penalty is of similar
magnitude among PhD students and journal editors. The penalty is larger when
experts predict a large effect and when statistical uncertainty is communicated
with p-values rather than standard errors. Our findings highlight the value of
pre-results review."
