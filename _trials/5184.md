abstract: "This study investigates the impact of providing sanitary pads in schools on the overall scholastic performance of schoolgirls. A sample of boys is also studied in the same school to see what's their response to sensitisation programs on menstrual health. There are two intervention groups and one control group. The first intervention group is a school which receives NGO sponsored sanitary pads in its ladies' room. The second intervention group not only receives the sanitary pads, but regular menstrual health sensitisation camps are also conducted there. Each group is a distinct low-income school of Delhi-NCR. We're trying to investigate if such interventions will help improve scholastic performance indicators like attendance, grades, ECA participation, and self-esteem in teenage schoolgirls. We're also trying to see if such camps are successful in sensitising boys."
