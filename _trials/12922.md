abstract: "While the international community strives to improve access, quality, and equity of basic education, community participation has a great potential to realize and sustain educational development, especially in the countries where the administration capacity is weak. In sub-Saharan Africa, the school management committee (SMC) has been introduced as an institution to invite parents and local community members to school management since the mid-1990s. While the introduction of the SMCs aimed to realize educational development with the participation of the local community, the functionality of SMCs remained low for various reasons, including the elite capture of the organization and the lack of transparency in school management.

In Madagascar, the SMC was introduced in 2002 and the school grant has been annually distributed to the SMCs from the government to support the operation of schools; however, the transparency of the resource use of the SMC remained low and the SMCs did not gain a trust from the local community. In 2015, the government revised the institutional framework of SMC to promote the participation of the local community in school management. To operationalize the SMC reform, the Ministry of Education developed a package of interventions to improve the functionality of SMC with technical cooperation from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).

This study sheds light on the transparency in school management to develop collaboration between the school and the local community. Specifically, this study mainly examines the following questions using a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT).

- Does the package of interventions developed in Madagascar enhance the transparency in the decision-making in the school management? Does the package of interventions enhance the collaboration between the school and the local community?
- Does the package of the interventions enhance the transparency in the management of school resources, such as the school grant? Does the package of interventions reduce the misuse of the school resources?
- Does the package of interventions develop the trust between school and local community?"
