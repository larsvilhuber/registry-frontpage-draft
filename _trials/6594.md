abstract: "While the universal policy of gender targeting in microfinance stems, inter alia, from the conventional wisdom that women are better credit risks, there has been little research on the underlying reasons for it. This study aims to contribute to that research gap by conducting microfinance lab-in-the-field or artefactual field experiments in comparable matrilineal and patrilineal societies in rural India to exploit the natural variation in social norms across these societies.
