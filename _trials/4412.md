abstract: "We report a cluster randomized trial in The Gambia evaluating a literacy and numeracy intervention for primary-aged children in remote parts of poor countries. The intervention combines para teachers, frequent monitoring focusing on improving teacher practice, and scripted lesson plans to deliver after-school supplementary classes. A similar intervention demonstrated large learning gains in a cluster randomized trial in rural India. After three academic years, children receiving the intervention scored 46 percentage points (3.2 SD) better on a combined literacy and numeracy test than control children.  This intervention holds great promise to address low learning levels in other poor, remote settings."
