abstract: "Even though the importance of savings for low income individuals has been repeatedly emphasized in the economics literature, its determinants are poorly understood. The traditional approach argues that the poor do not save in financial institutions because transaction costs are high and interest rates are low. On the other hand a wave of recent research shows that hyperbolic discounting and mental accounting may depress savings. How do we get people to save more? Policymakers have tried to implement programs and policies that “nudge” people to save more by either changing defaults or offering subsidies for savings. This paper examines a particular innovative financial product called prize-linked savings to address the question: Do lotteries induce savings?  This paper analyzes a randomized experiment that introduces prize-linked savings accounts in some bank branches in Mexico.
