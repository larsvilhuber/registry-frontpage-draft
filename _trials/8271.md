abstract: "Early childhood education is a vital tool in preparing children to become successful lifelong learners. However, early childhood teachers are often poorly compensated, ill-prepared to teach children in this important age group, and prone to turnover and exit from the profession. Porter-Leath’s Teacher Excellence Program (TEP) aims to strengthen the early childhood teachers’ effectiveness by improving their pedagogical knowledge and developing strong classroom practices. The TEP model is based on a variety of training, workshops, and coaching, in addition to regular individualized assessment and one-on-one mentoring by education specialists. This program is being evaluated via randomized controlled trial (RCT). Approximately 250 teachers, with about 20 students per teacher/classroom, will be randomized between treatment and control, across two years. Researchers will assess the impact of TEP on cognitive and non-cognitive skill development during the pre-K year, and kindergarten readiness in the year following the intervention. The study will also compare teacher satisfaction and turnover in the treatment and control groups.
