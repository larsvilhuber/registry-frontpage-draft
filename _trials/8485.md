abstract: "Understanding the mechanisms that explain altruistic actions has been subject to research for decades. To extend our knowledge of altruism in more complex situations, we investigate the role of social cohesion on altruistic transfers in network settings. To this end, we elicit a social network of friends and subsequently measure the relationship levels between them. Then, conditional on the elicited social network and relationships, we measure a series of mechanisms as potential mediational factors between social cohesion and transfer decisions with more than two players involved. Our set-up allows us to identify the degree to which individuals embedded in social networks take into account subsequent transfers between other parties, network information and individual identity."
