abstract: "A large body of evidence shows that group identity fosters cooperation, coordination, and trust. However, little is known about exploitation of group identity to justify self-serving behavior. We use a novel laboratory experiment to study whether, and if so to what extent, people make strategic group identity choices to behave opportunistically in the context of labor markets. At the beginning, in an effort choice setting, participants work in groups for two distinct firms, creating two potential group identities. Subsequently, participants in the role of a principals make wage offers to participants in the role of agents for a newly founded firm. As our treatment, we vary the disclosure of agents’ employment history to the principal, i.e., their previously shared group memberships. We conjecture that participants strategically search for or avoid additional information about agents’ employment histories to find dissimilarities. Finding dissimilarities allows principals to identify strategically with the non-shared group to justify outgroup wage discrimination."
