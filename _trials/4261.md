abstract: "Using information based on historic time use data from an online homework application, we calculate a statistically significant positive relationship between time spent on homework and final grade in an introductory microeconomics course. Along with collective important baseline questions about beliefs about ability and study effort, we randomly present this information to a subsequent class of intro microeconomics. We plan to measure the effect of this information on study effort as measuring both by student time spent on the online homework application as well as self-reported study time before multiple exams throughout the academic period."
