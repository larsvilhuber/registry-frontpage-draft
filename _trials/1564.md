abstract: "The study investigates the effects of a home-based intervention, Letterbox Club, in a Danish context on disadvantaged children's reading and mathematical skills. In Denmark, disadvantaged children, defined as children who receive in-home public interventions or children in foster care, do considerably worse in school than other children. The knowledge gap exists already at school start and it is not reduced during school years. 

In Letterbox Club the children receive six  packages every third week over the course of 16 weeks. The packages contain reading, writing and mathematical material. The packages also include games and a personal letter to the child from a role model. The effects of the intervention will be evaluated in a randomized control trial. "
