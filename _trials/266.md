abstract: "The Communication for Development (C4D) program is an intervention package implemented by UNICEF and Ghana Health Services (GHS) which aims to increase awareness of common health problems in Ghana and induce behavior change. The program aims to reduce both morbidity and mortality, particularly for children under five. The key behaviors that C4D attempts to influence are: (i) Exclusive breast feeding for the first six months and complementary feeding up to age 2; (ii) Hand washing with soap at key times (before and after cleaning a baby, before preparing food, and after defecating); (iii)Malaria prevention by sleeping under an insecticide treated net; (iv) Diarrhea treatment, specifically the importance of using ORS; and (v) Birth delivery by a skilled attendant.

The C4D program includes three complementary interventions: counseling and community outreach by Community Based Agents (CBAs), community dramas, and community radio broadcasts.  In addition, a Mobile for Development (M4D) campaign is currently being implemented, to further support and complement the basic C4D interventions. The M4D intervention delivers key health messages on the same five behaviors via pre-recorded voice messages. Beneficiaries receives two messages per week for 24 weeks.

Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) is evaluating the impact of the C4D program. In 2012, IPA conducted a baseline survey of 4320 respondents (mothers with children under the age of five) in 216 communities. For the C4D program, 108 communities were randomly selected. Within these 108 communities, 20 households per community were randomly selected to be surveyed. A midline survey was conducted from July-September 2014, and an endline survey will be conducted at the end of the program. 

In addition to the community-based interventions, approximately 2000 mothers were chosen for an individual level mobile phone intervention (M4D). The eligibility requirements for the M4D intervention included: (i) phone ownership or access to a phone through a family member living in the same household, and (ii) mothers with children under the age of five.Eligible mothers were randomly selected to either receive messages from the same speaker, or to receive messages from different speakers from their own area. Mobile voice messages were developed to cover the same five behaviors outlined above.
