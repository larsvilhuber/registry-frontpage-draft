abstract: "Evaluators tasked with learning about others typically receive signals dynamically about a menu of individuals who come from a variety of social groups. The proposed study aims to provide experimental evidence on distortions in belief updating that may occur in such settings. At the heart of the experiment is a statistical evaluation task. Experimental workers are drawn from a given ability distribution. Experimental employers then receive information on worker ability incrementally and report their updates. Treatments consider workers evaluated in isolation and sets of workers — drawn from the same or different distributions — assessed in tandem."
