abstract: "The first years of life are characterized by a high degree of brain plasticity and form a critical period for skill development. Unfortunately, in developing countries, poverty and other risk factors undermine children’s full developmental potential due to the lack of stimulating, nurturing and responsive caregiving. Moreover, fathers are generally not actively engaged in co-parenting.  Our goal is to implement a scalable group-based early childhood development (ECD) intervention and explore its complementarities with an additional father’s involvement component. This proposal seeks to conduct a feasibility and pilot study to adapt a proven ECD intervention (Reach-up and learn, RL) to the Indonesian context and design a complementary father’s co-parenting component by: i) identifying a scalable delivery mechanism; ii) adapting the RL curriculum to ensure cultural acceptability; iii) examining and adapting activities from proven father’s engagement programs; and iv) testing the interventions using a randomized control trial. This study will be conducted in 4 stages using focus-group discussions, in-depth interviews, and survey data collection. The results from this pilot will inform the design of a large-scale RCT, which will allow us to rigorously test the proposed interventions at a larger scale, paying special attention to feasibility, cost-effectiveness and sustainability of impacts."
