abstract: "Academic conversation about prosocial lending via crowdfunding platforms assumes that lenders and borrowers interact directly. Yet, the major platform for crowdfunding prosocial loans relies on partner institutions that manage the process on behalf of the borrowers. In this study, we test whether borrowers could be trained in more autonomous management of their campaign. Using a randomized control trial, we measure the marginal impact of adding crowdfunding training to group of waitlisted borrowers at a government-sponsored organization for small and medium enterprises in Tanzania. Treatment groups received a baseline training about basic managerial and financial accounting, as well as a crowdfunding training session during a workshop day to prepare the campaign. Control groups only received the baseline training.
