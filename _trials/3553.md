abstract: "Opportunity-focused, high-growth entrepreneurship and science-led innovation are crucial for continued economic growth and productivity. Working in these fields offers the opportunity for rewarding and high-paying careers. However, the majority of youth in developing countries do not consider either as job options, affecting their choices of what to study. Youth may not select these educational and career paths due to lack of knowledge, lack of appropriate skills, and lack of role models. We are working to provide a scalable approach to overcoming these constraints through an online education course for secondary school students that covers entrepreneurial soft skills, scientific methods, and interviews with role models. This course will be taken by students during class time, under teacher supervision. 
There are then three policy problems that we aim to use nimble evaluations to provide evidence on:
1)	Maximizing take-up: How can the Ministry of Education maximize take-up of the program in selected schools, ensuring that teachers use it in their classes?
2)	Content ordering: Is it better to try to inspire students first through interviews with role models, or to first build their knowledge and skills so that they connect better with role models?
3)	Standardized or Adaptive Learning: Should the same assessment tools be used for all students, or are learning gains higher with exercises that adapt to the interests and abilities of students?
