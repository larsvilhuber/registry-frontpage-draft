abstract: "Limited attention may play a role in explaining the inability to reach savings goals. Presuming that attention is a scarce resource and important for the pursuit of saving plans, limits to attention in inter-temporal consumption and saving decisions may cause savers not to reach their savings goals. In turn, constant feedback on the savings performance may help to reach savings goals in the presence of limited attention. In this project we draw on a simple experiment to test whether the visual representation of savings balances stimulates savings behavior and helps individuals reach their savings goals. Doing so, we randomly offer transparent and non-transparent moneyboxes as a complementary savings device to current and former clients of a microfinance organization in Ethiopia. We hypothesize that the visual representation of saving balances via transparent money boxes increases savings and helps microfinance clients reach their savings goals. While this is our working hypothesis, we may also observe the opposite, i.e. that the visual representation of saving balances via transparent money boxes decreases savings (e.g. because of a higher temptation to spend money that can be seen, or because it is less likely to hide savings from others)."
