abstract: "In the UK, access to many university courses, especially those associated to high incomes, depends on the A levels taken. These in turn reflect a choice made at school age, depending on oneâ€™s environment at school and the quality of advice available.  A planned change in economics admissions criteria at a Russell Group university will extend access to applicants without mathematics A levels, broadening the set of potential students in terms of secondary education choices and possibly socio-economic backgrounds. We examine potential changes in the demographics of economics students, their academic and labour market outcomes, and measures of social mobility. "
