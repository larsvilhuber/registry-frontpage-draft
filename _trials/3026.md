abstract: "A large body of empirical evidence emphasizes the role played by parents in the human capital development of children. However, little is known on the determinants of parental decisions to invest in children. Empirical evidence indicates a strong negative correlation between socio-economic status and parental investment. It has been commonly assumed that poor parents lack the information, have wrong beliefs on returns to investment or lack the knowledge of good parenting practices. In contrast, recent experimental evidence indicates that poverty taxes mental resources and shifts focus towards pressing needs at the expense of decision with long-term consequences. This study proposes a novel experimental design to test whether financial concerns associated with poverty affect the decisions of parents to invest in their children. Parents are exposed to a prime inducing financial concerns followed by an investment game. We test a potential policy instrument in one additional treatment where we lower the price of investment to assess whether changing the trade-off against pressing needs can increase focus on the decision to invest in the child."
