abstract: "This document describes the research design and analysis strategy of our field experiment, designed to boost training and employment of unemployed. We start with a detailed outline of the two parts of the intervention, which take place in early 2021 during a Covid-19 induced partial lockdown in the region of Lower Austria (Nieder√∂sterreich) in Austria. Unemployed receive an email newsletter, which for some contains a training voucher and additional information. In the first intervention, we designed multiple different treatment arms to separate out direct effects of raising awareness, supporting reciprocity, and strengthening perceived autonomy. In the second intervention, we send out variations of the training voucher email, which are informed by a pre-intervention survey. We provide a detailed discussion of our sample selection, variables used and the handling of the data to make the analysis as transparent and replicable as possible. We report the outcomes of our stratified randomization. Further, we state our hypotheses and outcomes of interest motivated by the active labour market policy evaluation literature. Finally, we conclude by specifying our statistical approach to inference."
