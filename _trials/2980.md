abstract: "Evidence on the impact of microfinance loans on business outcomes shows moderately positive, but not transformational effects especially for women. This finding has been linked to the fact that women do not invest the loans in their own business or they choose less profitable low-risk activities. We run a field experiment with microfinance female borrowers in Pakistan to test whether an intervention that exposes women to successful role models, and encourages goal setting, planning and the overcoming of obstacles can foster investments in higher-return activities. Moreover, we also study whether intra-household dynamics and social constraints interact with this treatment by cross-randomizing this intervention with the presence of the spouse."
