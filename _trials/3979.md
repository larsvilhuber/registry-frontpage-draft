abstract: "This is a pre-analysis plan for a modified conceptual replication study of an artefactual mail field experiment with all commercial German fishermen on how truth-telling, as measured by a standard coin-tossing task, depends on the salience of their ill-regarded regulator, the EU, that we ran in winter 2015/2016."
