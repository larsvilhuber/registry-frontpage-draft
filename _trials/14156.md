abstract: "The purpose of this research project is twofold. We first aim to compare incentivized measures of polarization – captured as behavior in trust & prisoner dilemma games – against commonly used survey-elicited measurements of polarization. To do so, we employ an event-study approach, comparing polarization levels at an early stage of the presidential campaign and around the US presidential election. This also enables us to address our second research goal, namely to experimentally investigate the effect of the US presidential election process on affective polarization."
