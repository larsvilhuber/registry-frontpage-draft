abstract: "In this study, we design a two-stage experiment to test the comparative static predictions of a leading model of reference-dependent preferences. In particular, we derive predictions from Koszegi and Rabin (2006, 2007) (henceforth KR) for both loss averse and gain loving individuals, and demonstrate how inconclusive average treatment effects from prior studies could be confounded by heterogeneity in gain-loss preferences. We then prepend a first stage to the classic experimental tests of KR in the real effort domain (Abeler et al, 2011; Gneezy et al, 2017) intended to measure individual gain-loss preferences, and examine the difference in treatment effects by type in our second stage."
