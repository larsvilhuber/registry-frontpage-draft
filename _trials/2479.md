abstract: "We propose to study a BIM diffusion strategy in which academically successful individuals from targeted communities play the primary role in spreading information and training. These individuals are drawn from Beca18, a social inclusion program in higher education that facilitates access to post-secondary studies for impoverished high school graduates. In other words, we will explore whether adoption of financial technologies among the poor can be speeded-up by using role models from the community in the diffusion process.
To implement our RCT, first we will invite Beca18 fellows at a local private university in Peru, to be part of a campaign supporting the diffusion of financial services in their neighborhoods/communities, with no mention of the BIM or the specific role they might play in its diffusion. Half of the volunteers will be randomly selected to diffuse information and training related to the new BIM to their household network. In the case of the other half, their household network will receive information and training related to the new BIM by an external agent 
For each Beca18 fellow in our intervention, we will map their household network within their neighborhood/community by asking them who the adult members in their household interact with in their neighborhood/community. They will also be asked to rank these household links in terms of the interaction intensity. We will select 10 to 12 members from this set and invite them to participate in the BIM training sessions.
