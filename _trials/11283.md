abstract: "This study investigates the opinion of Lebanese students on bank trust in the wake of the recent Lebanese banking crisis. Using a vignette experiment, we explore the causal effects on trust of bank and deposit characteristics. Using an individual post-vignette survey, we explore how trust in banks is also associated with respondent socio-demographic characteristics and attitudinal opinions."
