abstract: "The online labor market affords greater flexibility that may favor women. And yet, female labor force participation in the online labor market remains limited. We conduct an online experiment on a major freelance hiring platform to study the impact of greater flexibility in choosing work hours within a day on female participation. We post identical job advertisements that differ randomly only in job flexibility and the fee offered. We compare the responses to job postings with different levels of wages and flexibility to understand whether and how much women value flexibility. From the information collected in the pilot, we find that the share of women applicants indeed increases when jobs pay more or are more flexible.
