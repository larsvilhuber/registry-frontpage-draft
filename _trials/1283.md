abstract: "We investigate (1) how the presence of ordinary citizens at municipal council meetings affects the behavior of municipal decision makers, and (2) how personalized invitations to attend a municipal council meeting as a "citizen observer" influence ordinary citizens' voluntary civic participation, as well as their attitudes towards municipal governance. In a first phase, from November 2015 through May 2016, the experiment is carried out on centrally appointed local councils (special delegations), which were established in the aftermath of the popular insurrection in 2014. In a second phase, following the 2016 municipal elections, the experiment will be continued on the newly elected municipal councils that will replace the special delegations. 

A pre-analysis plan will be attached to this design registration prior to the investigators' access to outcome data. "
