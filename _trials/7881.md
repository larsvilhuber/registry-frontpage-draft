abstract: "We conduct RCTs to evaluate a DVD-based distance-learning program targeted at university entrance exam preparation for students in rural Bangladesh. University entrance exams in Bangladesh are highly competitive and require dedicated test preparation to ensure success. Most urban students taking university entrance exams attend prep schools called “coaching centers,” or hire private tutors for exam preparation. Such services rarely extend to rural areas due to the limited market and the unwillingness of teachers to live in such areas. In addition, the fees charged for these services are often beyond the reach of rural households. As a result, rural students systematically underperform in entrance exams, narrowing their opportunities to receive tertiary education. To correct the accessibility gap, we created DVD lectures taught by reputable prep school teachers and provided rural students with access to these DVD lectures, using laptops together with lecture notes and problem-solving tutorial classes. We evaluate this program by conducting two randomized experiments: The first experiment is to evaluate the impact of the program; and the second experiment is to examine its price sensitivity. The study site is in Chandpur District of Chittagong Division, located 220 km away from the capital city of Bangladesh, Dhaka"
