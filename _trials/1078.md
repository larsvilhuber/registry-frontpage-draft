abstract: "This study examines the impact of attending two years of kindergarten on child development and primary-school performance. We offer scholarships to attend a Hippocampus Learning Centre private kindergarten to random subset of low-socioeconomic-status children and measure outcomes at baseline, after two years, and after three years.

We also present the results of this experiment to parents residing in villages where Hippocampus operates to study what relative value they place on different types of skills."
