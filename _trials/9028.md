abstract: "Ensuring sustainable water usage is an ever-pressing concern for Australia and internationally for counties like Singapore. By partnering with a water utility, this project aims to combine large scale field experiments, machine learning, and data from smart devices that provide real-time feedback. This new knowledge will underpin the empirical development of new behavioural economic models (habit, beliefs formation, and reference-dependent decision making with rational inattention). These models will be able to be immediately deployed, informing policies designed to promote water conservation, encourage efficient water network investment, and help households anticipate and reduce water costs, particularly among disadvantaged groups."
