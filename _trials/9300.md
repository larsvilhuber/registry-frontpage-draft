abstract: "This project examines the existence and mechanisms of potential side effects that rendering the outcome of algorithmic assessments transparent may entail. Our main objective is to test whether such algorithmic transparency can steer an assessee's behavior into the direction of the assessment, i.e., create a self-fulfilling prophecy. We use an incentivized online experiment to test hypotheses derived from psychological and economic theories. Specifically, participants engage in incentivized investment games, where we vary investors’ and recipients’ access to an assessment about recipients’ likelihood to repay an investment. The assessment either originates from a human expert or a trained machine learning model."
