abstract: "This study aims to test whether two entertainment-based educational campaigns can: i) change social norms around the acceptability of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) as a tool to control behaviors that are seen as undesirable (“norms campaign”); and ii) increase men’s resilience to acute stressors that may trigger violent impulses ("resilience campaign"). We expose participants to one of three versions of the same soap opera: norms campaign, resilience campaign, and placebo campaign. We further randomize whether participants are exposed to the norms or placebo campaigns privately, on a small electronic device, or publicly, in a community setting. We test: i) whether a media campaign designed to reduce the acceptability of violence reduces the prevalence of IPV (norms versus placebo); ii) whether teaching coping skills reduces the incidence of hot state violence (resilience versus placebo) and iii) whether the effects are stronger when changing beliefs about others’ beliefs about the acceptability of IPV (norms public-norms private vs placebo public-placebo private).
