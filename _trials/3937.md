abstract: "We describe the analysis plan for a laboratory experiment that will examine the effects of hydrocortisone administration on in-group preferences, specifically coethnic preference. The study will be conducted with individuals living in Nairobi, Kenya who are from the Luo, Kikuyu, Luhya and Kamba ethnic groups. Using a double-blind procedure, participants are randomly administered either a placebo or an identical-looking 20 mg dose of hydrocortisone, a drug that increases the levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Participants complete several experimental tasks in which they are paired with individuals that vary in their gender, age group, and ethnicity. We outline the study design, the outcomes of interest, and the econometric strategy for the analysis."
