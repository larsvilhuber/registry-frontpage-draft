abstract: "We study play in a series of indefinitely repeated prisoner’s dilemma games that vary in the probability that the game continues from one period to the next. Subjects play against a known, programmed grim trigger strategy, so that it is possible that they decide how to play each indefinitely repeated game based on expected earnings from their action choices. In a treatment variation, the payoffs from the programmed grim trigger strategy go to another human subject, while in the baseline treatment they do not.  We collect measures of subjects’ cognitive abilities and their social value orientation. We also elicit priors as to how frequently across the various games they face that they will choose the cooperative or defect option in the first round of each new repeated game.  We are particularly interested in whether these measures correlate with play in the repeated game.    "
