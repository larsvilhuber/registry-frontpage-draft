abstract: "The aim of this project is two-fold: i) it aims to study how the elicited cooperative types a la Fischbacher et al., (2001) and Kurzban and Houser (2005) relate to other observable characteristics and personal values (TIVI), and ii) to investigate the relationship between environmental attitudes and cooperative preferences of Norwegian citizens. We use the strategy method to elicit subject’s cooperative preferences. We use both the Fischbacher et al., (2001) and Kurzban and Houser (2005) procedure to classify subjects into cooperative types separately. Fischbacher et al., (2001) classify subjects into free riders, hump shaped contributors and conditional cooperators based on their conditional contributions in the strategy method.  Kurzban and Houser (2005) on the other hand estimate Linear Contribution Profiles of subject’s conditional contributions and classify subjects as either cooperators, free riders or reciprocators.

Much of the scientific literature agrees: human behavior is the main driving force behind climate change (Cook et al., 2013). However, to make people take on behaviors that would help protect the environment, we need to better our understanding of how individual differences affect attitudes toward climate change in different countries. The present project investigates the relationship between environmental attitudes and cooperative preferences of Norwegian citizens in an online panel offering a representative cross section of the Norwegian population. Taking action against climate change demands a high degree of cooperation, both between nations and among individuals. Our aim is to investigate to which degree cooperative differences underpin Norwegians attitudes toward climate change. To nuance the relationship between environmental attitudes and cooperative differences, we also elicit value priorities of the respondents. Hence, we examine individual differences along three dimensions; (1) the monetary (unconditional and conditional contributions), (2) environmental (survey attitudinal measures), and (3) the value dimension (TIVI).
