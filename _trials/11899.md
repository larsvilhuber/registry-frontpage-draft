abstract: "In the rapid evolution of the digital economy, the escalating severity of online fraud has spurred widespread concern, prompting the exploration of effective countermeasures. This paper plans to collaborate with a major online payment platform in China and run a randomized control trial. We will explore in the context of online payment, what is the most effective intervention in aiding users to recognize scams and reducing the incidence rate of online fraud. We will also analyse the heterogeneous effects of various interventions on different population."
