abstract: "Hand hygiene is central to public health, yet rates of hand-washing practice around the world are abysmal. Beyond avoiding uncomfortable and potentially deadly health outcomes for victims of communicable illness, encouraging better hand hygiene should be a priority for both policymakers and industrial leaders who have financial incentives in mind as both absence from work and reduced productivity while sick on the job lead to nearly $600 billion a year in costs to the United States economy alone (Japsen, 2012). Insights from academic research in psychology suggest that simple changes to the decision-making environment can prompt large-scale changes in behavioral trends. Research indicates that when hands are not visibly soiled, hand sanitizer with an alcohol content of 60 to 95 percent is actually more effective in killing microorganisms on hands than plain or antibacterial soap (Boyce & Pittet, 2002). Hand sanitizer dispensers are becoming ubiquitous in public spaces and demand little effort to use but — according to data on refill frequency and conversations with maintenance staff in our office building — may in many cases be seldom visited. We aspire to nudge more frequent hand sanitization in order to create a healthier workplace.
The intervention will involve data collection on the behavior of visitors on up to 14 floors of an office building. All foot traffic passes by hallway hand sanitizer dispensers that are located adjacent to toilet facilities at either end of a central hallway lined with elevators. In order to encourage more frequent use of the dispenser stations, we propose implementing behavioral nudges on floors around the dispenser or just above the dispenser stations that are assigned to the two experimental condition during the randomization process."
