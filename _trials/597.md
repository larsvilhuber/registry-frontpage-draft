abstract: "Dance Movement Therapy is “the psychotherapeutic use of movement as a process which furthers emotional, social, cognitive, and physical integration of the individual” (American Dance Therapy Association, 2006). In Dance Movement Therapy, the movement of an individual reflects how he/ she thinks and feels, becomes the gateway into the person’s mental state of being (Helene, 2006). Literature suggests that movement exercises increase dopamine in the brain in children with ADHD ( Gronlund et al, 2005 ; Dulicai 1999). Studies explored the qualitative and stylistic features of movement that might distinguish hyperactive children from normally developing children. It was found that the hyperactive children showed a greater incidence of strength and intensity, and unexpected transitions (Goodman, 1999) . Previous studies have concluded that dance movement therapy, not only attempted in increasing attention, reducing hyperactivity and impulsivity but also reduced sense of disturbed body image, promote safe emotional expression and clearer positive sense of self, including better perception of external body boundaries as well as internal boundaries (Van Wagnen, 1999; Rachmany 2000; Cavanagh et al, 2001,  Gronlund et al, 2005).This research aims to explore the efficacy of dance moment therapy in reducing the symptoms of ADHD in children
