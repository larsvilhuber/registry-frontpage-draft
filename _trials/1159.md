abstract: "Individual preferences and traits form mostly during childhood and adolescence and the environment in which children grow up plays an important role in this process. For children with behavioral problems, it is common they are placed into special institutions. There teachers, psychologists and special educators work with children to improve their development. However, it is still unclear what effect those institutions really have on children and their preferences. The present project investigates how the detention centers affect formation of the delinquent identity and subsequent cooperative and norm-violating behavior of problematic children. In order to do this, we run a lab in the field experiment with children and adolescents from detention centers in the Czech Republic. "
