abstract: "We propose a lab experiment to establish properties of the control premium in the context of a real effort task. Using a within-subject design, we test for the existence of a control premium as well as its sensitivity to the expected number of control events and the relevant stakes. This experiment also uses between-subject variation to determine whether participants exhibit an endowment effect with respect to control. In order to disentangle the control premium from probability weighting and the certainty effect, we compare participants' valuations of the control lottery to a lottery with similar stakes that does not feature a control component. Our framework has important implications for the design of Direct Load Control contracts in electricity. "
