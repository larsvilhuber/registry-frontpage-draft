abstract: "We collaborate with a large job portal website to understand which characteristics of job seekers are valued by prospective employers in different sectors on the Indonesian labor market. We will use a modified version of the Incentivized Resume Rating (IRR) design proposed by Kessler et al. (2019). This tool allows to elicit employer preferences for job applicants’ characteristics without deception.  Employers will be offered the possibility to participate in an experiment in which they will be asked to rate a number of resumes of hypothetical candidates. We will generate random resumes of hypothetical candidates by randomizing socio-demographic features of the candidates, typical characteristics used by employers to assess candidates’ quality, and the picture of the applicant. Employers will be told that the resumes are only hypothetical (thus avoiding deception), but will be incentivized to disclose their true preferences because their rating will later be used to select real job applicants who best matches the employer’s stated preferences through machine-learning algorithms.
