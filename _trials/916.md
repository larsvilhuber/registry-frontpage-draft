abstract: "This project aims to implement a methodology that uses recordings from brain activity to improve the accuracy
with which commonly used in personality and creativity questionnaires to measure traits and abilities. Participants in the
study will be asked to perform a few different tasks that require the use of cognitive, social and emotional skills. Before and while
they are performing the tasks, researchers will record (electrophysiological) activity in their brain using a standard methodology called Electroencephalography, or EEG. 

We are performing an RCT in eight vocational schools in Chile, where four among them received a program designed to foster life skills at the beginning of the academic year in March 2015. "
