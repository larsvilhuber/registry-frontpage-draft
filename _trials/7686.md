abstract: "We study a cohort of students at the School of Business and Economics at a German university in their second semester which is entirely held online due to COVID-19. We design and implement a program that provides students with a tutor in economics subjects from a more advanced semester and induces peer-to-peer interaction. Tutors support randomly formed groups of 2 to 3 students. The tutors and the groups meet online and discuss problem sets in microeconomics and macroeconomics. To determine effects of the intervention, we measure the students' performance in both subjects as well as their self-reported mental health and motivation."
