abstract: "Mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders, are prevalent in the workplace and can significantly affect both employees' well-being and overall productivity. This study aims to investigate the effects of enhancing managerial capital and promoting employees' common knowledge in creating a healthier and more productive work environment.

I run a field experiment involving 720 managers and 12,000 manufacturing workers across 180 departments in an automobile company. The departments are divided into two treatment groups and one control group. In both treatment groups, managers receive a specialized training program focused on mental health literacy and emotion management when dealing with subordinates. Additionally, half of the treated managers hold meetings with their subordinates to promote awareness of the training and alleviate concerns about potential biases against mental health issues.

The study assesses the impact of these interventions on employeesâ€™ perceptions, behaviors, job performance, and mental health outcomes. The findings can provide valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners aiming to improve mental health in the workplace and enhance overall labor productivity."
