abstract: "The ambition of this project is to evaluate the impact of an inclusive microfinance program called 'We can manage!', targeting disabled people in rural Uganda. The idea behind the program, which also has a gender focus, is to reduce financial barriers and build capacity and confidence among the participants in the microfinance program, and to reduce prejudice in society by demonstrating the ability of disabled to manage and mobilize resources. The key question of our research is: Does the program lead to economic empowerment and increased well-being? And: Does the program lead to changes in business attitudes and in attitudes to disability and gender among the disabled?
