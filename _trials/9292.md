abstract: "The Innovation Research Boot Camp (IRBC) aims to encourage high-quality innovation research by reducing entry barriers to the field.  The IRBC will introduce more young scholars to the cutting-edge of research and equip them with leading research methods.  The IRBC further seeks to overcome institutional and community barriers that limit collaborative opportunities, mentoring opportunities, the dissemination of ideas, and the diversity of thought in the field.

Measuring the impact of the IRBC will help us understand the value-added of this program both on average and across different groups of students.  For example, if the program appears to have larger benefits for individuals from less elite institutions or from underrepresented groups, such findings could be used to target admission decisions in future years.

Among the students who apply and meet the program requirements, randomizing which applicants we admit versus reject provides the most transparent way to estimate the impact of the IRBC.  This process can also have benefits in avoiding conflicts of interest or implicit bias in the admissions decision.
