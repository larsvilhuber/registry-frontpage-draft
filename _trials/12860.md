abstract: "Addressing climate change requires international cooperation, widespread adoption of renewable energy (RE), and public support for the energy transition. While climate change mitigation is a global public good, investing in RE often yields local co-benefits like job creation, clean air, and enhanced energy security. Presently, developed countries account for a large share of global RE demand and technological knowledge, while many developing countries have favorable technical conditions for scaling RE.
Competing (economic) narratives exist on how to address global challenges like climate change, with varying perspectives on cooperation versus competition with other nations. This conceptually links to moral universalism in altruism: the extent to which people exhibit the same level of altruism towards strangers as towards in-group members, such as fellow citizens. Namely, altruism towards citizens from their own country vs. other countries (out-group) may be an important explanatory and moderator variable for the support of domestically vs. foreign-orientated RE policies.
This study bridges two recent strings of literature by jointly exploring the role of narratives and moral universalism in promoting policy support. Our information experiment with German and Spanish households investigates the effect of energy transition narratives, that vary the location of (domestic versus foreign) (i) RE investment and (ii) co-benefits, on the desired public spending for domestic and foreign RE policies. By further exploring heterogeneity by moral universalism, we contribute to the literature which suggests that narratives shape economic beliefs, actions and policy views, but cannot fully explain why some narratives have a stronger effect than others. Our study also provides the first experimental evidence of the role of causal narratives on policy support for climate change mitigation."
