abstract: "This study investigates whether providing passengers with a pecuniary incentive to use both public transportation and ridesharing in their daily commute increases the demand for e-hailing services as a means to complete first- or last-mile trips. To do so, we designed and implemented an experiment in partnership with one of São Paulo's largest e-hailing platforms in which some of the service's active users were randomly assigned eligibility to two daily discounts for app trips starting or ending in a train/subway station. Discounts were available over ten weekdays, in two randomly assigned regimes: two daily 20% discounts (limited to 10 BRL per trip), and two daily 50% discounts (also limited to 10 BRL). Using the random assignment and the user's history in the platform, we assess whether increased discounts indeed increase modal integration."
