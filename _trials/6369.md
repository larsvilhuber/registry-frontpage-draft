abstract: "While the persistent gap in early childcare enrollment by parents’ socioeconomic status (SES) is well-documented, the underlying reasons for lower enrollment among children from lower SES backgrounds remain a puzzle. To investigate whether decisions of childcare center managers may partially account for the SES gap in enrollment, this project experimentally studies whether childcare center managers’ beliefs and perceived admission probability differ systematically by parental SES. To this end, we conduct an online survey experiment in which we ask childcare center managers to rate fictitious email inquiries of parents. We employ a factorial survey design that randomly varies signals of parental SES (migration background and occupation) to identify potential determinants of childcare center managers’ admission decisions."
