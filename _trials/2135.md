abstract: "Pro Kind is a home visiting program to support disadvantaged families. It was implemented in three German states (Bremen, Lower Saxony and Saxony) with a sample of 755 first-time, welfare receiving, at-risk, expectant mothers from 2006 to 2010. Half of the participants were randomly allocated to the home visits which began between the 12th and 28th weeks of pregnancy and ended at the child’s second birthday. The frequency of the home visits varied between weekly, biweekly, and monthly visits, with the highest visit frequency occurring directly before and after birth. Overall, 52 home visits with an average duration of 90 minutes are scheduled between pregnancy and the child’s second birthday. An interdisciplinary research team evaluates the short-, mid-, and longterm effects of the program on family environment, maternal and child health, and child development. Data is collected by face to face and telephone interviews, and objective child developmental assessments, such as the Bayley Scales of Infant Development . Additionally, parts of the participants were merged with administrative social security records and health insurance utilization data. Assessments and interviews were conducted during pregnancy, at 6, 12 and 24 months after births. At the moment data is collected at children's age 6 to 7. "
