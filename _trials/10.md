abstract: "Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) has been linked to low productivity in adults, slowing of cognitive and physical growth among children and, in the elderly, increased risk of cognitive impairment and physical disability, as well as decreased muscle strength. While iron deficiency anemia has been recognized to be a serious public health problem in developing countries for several years, something that both limits the working population and increases risks for cognitive impairment and health shocks in the elderly, not much progress has yet been made against it. Distributing iron supplements appears to be an impractical policy in resource-poor settings where the public health systems do not have the capacity to maintain a large-scale distribution system. Iron supplementation of foods is therefore an attractive alternative: it requires no additional effort on the part of the consumer, and can be done relatively cheaply in centralized locations. 

This study measures the impact of giving free Double (Iron and Iodine) Fortified Salt to randomly assigned households in 62 villages, compared to households who were randomly assigned to no free salt.  The households which we give DFS will still choose whether to use free DFS or not, which will constrain potential health benefits.  We expect to observe increases in haemoglobin, particularly among  individuals anemic at baseline if households respond to the offer of free salt by using it to cook human food."
