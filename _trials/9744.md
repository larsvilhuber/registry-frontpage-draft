abstract: "We study choice under risk by presenting lotteries in a spinning wheel. A prize in a spinning wheel presents a state, and the outcome of the state depends on a binary lottery choice. We maintain marginal distributions of lotteries identical and change joint distributions. Our design allows us to isolate the effect of salience and we are able to rule out other theories of choice under risk for inconsistent behavior. We complement the experiment with eye-tracking measures which help us tease out the shape of salience. These measures allow us to grasp how states that ”stand out” guide choice under risk. We also present choices between lotteries in separate wheels which shed light on how an endogenous decision-making process may lead to a different tolerance towards risk. Our results have significant implications for the insurance market. Benevolent regulation surrounding the choice architecture could significantly improve consumer welfare. "
