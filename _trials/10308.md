abstract: "An estimated 3.5 million households in England live in fuel poverty and/or council homes rated low in terms of energy efficiency performance. Now, these households are being hit by extremely high energy costs due to skyrocketing energy prices. We estimate that the UK could easily reduce its energy consumption in the residential sector by 30%, saving households at least GBP 11 billion per year in fuel bills, without lowering their standard of living.  Central government interventions, though, taking the shape of an Energy Price Guarantee threaten to weaken incentives of households to become more aware of the large potential savings that can be realized if properties are upgraded. At present, we believe that a lack of awareness of how much money could be saved by insulating properties in the UK, is undermining both individual, but also local and national political action in that domain. Still, local governments have the right tools to enable actions that could save UK households millions of pounds, as local councils decide on planning permits including for home insulations. Thus, we will provide localized information about energy burden and energy savings potential at the local authority level to district officials, council members, and media. With our bottom-up approach, we believe that our project is well-positioned to influence local governments into adopting such measures to facility energy savings."
