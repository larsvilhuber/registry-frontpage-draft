abstract: "The question of how firms improve their productivity is of paramount policy importance for every nation. In this project, we investigate the importance of the information gap in hindering technology adoption and firm performance. For this end, we implement an RCT type of intervention by providing a randomly selected firm with information about their website performance and technology usage. This paper examines how information provision about the firm's website performance change the adoption of web-based technologies, website performance and improve firm financial performance. 
 
The information provision or encouragement design will be carried out to randomly selected firms. The intervention is in terms of a toolkit that consist of the firm's own and benchmark information. The toolkit uses information from three sources:  for information on technology usage data come from builtwith, for website speed data come from batchspeed, and for search engine performance we obtain data from Moz."
