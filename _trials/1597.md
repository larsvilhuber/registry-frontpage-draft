abstract: "I introduce a new experimental design that 1) enables a direct estimate of the variance of underreaction to not-fully-salient-taxes, 2) makes it possible to test for “overreaction” as well as “underreaction” 3) enables many novel tests of a model of “deliberate inattention” to taxes and 4) from a statistical standpoint is generally a significantly more efficient design for estimating underreaction than existing laboratory and field experiments.
