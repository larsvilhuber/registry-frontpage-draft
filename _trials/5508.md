abstract: "Football for development program uses football training to introduce many of the key issues around inclusion and has a goal to increase participants’ self-awareness and awareness of others, confidence, social skills and their sense of belonging and self-worth. On these pitches, football plays an important role in making teams of people from different backgrounds. The program promotes values of universal respect and helping those who are vulnerable or isolated to transform their situations. This program is being delivered to schools' students as part of their PE classes, and to migrant workers who sign up for the program in different worker accommodation compounds in Qatar.
Each cycle has 10 sessions delivered in one-hour football sessions of around 15-20 players per coach, and it will teach workers social skills through football tactics, culminating with a tournament. Despite efforts, it has been difficult to increase registration and attendance rates. The aim of this study is to test whether being exposed to a behaviorally informed recruitment flyer increases registration rates, compared to a standard flyer. Additionally, we will test whether sending registered participants a weekly text reminding them of their upcoming training session will increase attendance rates, compared to no text. "
