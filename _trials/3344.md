abstract: "This study aims to look at the effectiveness of advocacy campaigns to reduce tobacco consumption through behavioral nudges in the chars of rural Bangladesh. Two different interventions will be assessed: (1) Repeated nudges through visual warning posters on tobacco intake, and (2) Record keeping of daily tobacco intake to counter non-rational discounting of individual tobacco consumption events. Smoking status of the participants will be assessed though Carbon Monoxide readings for more accurate measures vis-Ã -vis self-reported tobacco intake. The project aims to target smoking and smokeless tobacco consumption behavior for both males and females. "
