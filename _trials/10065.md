abstract: "Intertemporal choices - decisions for which costs and benefits are spread out over time - are an important part pf regular decision-making for households, policymakers and managers. They are relevant to decisions about consumption, and savings and investment, which are among the most important choices made by economic agents. The experimental design consists of two stages that we will conduct in collaboration with the Department of Health, Punjab (Pakistan). In the first stage, we will elicit Lady Health Workers (LHWs) discounting parameters using the Convex Time Budget (CTB) technique. In the second stage, after assigning tailored contracts to LHWs, we will test how these tailored contracts perform. In our setup, we propose and test intertemporal contracts for two types of policymakers: Leontief and maximizer."
