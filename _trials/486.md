abstract: "Agricultural production entails large risks from crop failure which farmers living at subsistence levels are ill-suited to bear. Attempts to reduce these risks through insurance contracts have typically been unsuccessful due to low take-up rates. In this project, we work with one of the largest private sector contract farming schemes in East Africa, investigating what constrains the take-up rate and testing innovative insurance schemes for contract farming settings. This project will consider the role of inter-temporal distortions in constraining take-up.

The theoretical justification for insurance is as a transfer across states, not across time: the welfare gain arises through shifting consumption from good states, where the marginal utility of consumption is low, to bad states, where it is high. However, standard insurance contracts work by the payment of a premium ex-ante for an ex-post state dependent payout. That is, real world insurance contracts combine state dependent payouts with saving, rather than with other state dependent payouts. Insurance shifts risk from those from whom it is more costly to those for whom it is less costly, but in its standard formulation these welfare improvements are partly offset by shifting saving from those for whom it is likely to be cheap to those for whom it is expensive.

The most likely reason for the standard ex-ante payment is enforcement. An insurance contract which is just a transfer across states with no ex-ante payment is unlikely to be incentive compatible: in the absence of enforceable contracts, as may be the case in many rural agricultural settings, in good states the insured would not pay the insurer. Contract farming offers a potential solution to this, thus allowing insurance to be offered without a transfer across time. Since the farmer and buyer enter a contract (typically enforced on the side of the farmer through the buyer having a monopsony) the buyer can provide inputs on credit to the farmer, with the cost reclaimed with interest from the harvest revenue of the farmer. Currently, the partner company offers several inputs (e.g., land preparation, fertilizer) to farmers in this way, enabling them to solve the challenge of increasing levels of fertilizer use in Kenya. Similarly the buyer can offer insurance with the premium paid on credit (or, equivalently, in the form of a flatter payment schedule).

The proposed research will investigate whether demand for insurance with ex-post premium is higher than traditional insurance and if so, which of the possible mechanisms / inter-temporal distortions are important in constraining demand in this setting. It will do so by randomly offering either ex-post premium or standard insurance to farmers and then observing the difference in take up rate."
