abstract: "Community Health Workers (CHWs) programs are becoming increasingly popular in sub-Saharan Africa. In recent years, community health workers have become an essential part of national and international health strategies on the delivery of health care in the region. At the same time, there is a concern that the low motivation of CHWs may threaten the potential benefits of investing in CHW programs. This study wants to investigate to what extent a model in which non-financial incentives are offered on top of basic monetary benefits can result in a sustainable and effective system to incentivize CHWs. First, we study incentives activating intrinsic motivation of the agents, related to the pro-social characteristics of the CHW role and non-monetary rewards targeting the extrinsic motivation of the agents, such as social recognition in the community. Second, this study wants also to test whether the dissemination of information on CHWs’ work in targeted communities could improve the effectiveness of the program. Finally, we will also devote attention to the possible complementary between the different non-financial incentive schemes, as well as to the complementary between incentive schemes and more informed beneficiaries.
