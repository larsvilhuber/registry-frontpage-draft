abstract: "We report results from a novel field experiment aimed at increasing the percentage of women majoring in economics by exposing students enrolled in principles of economics classes to charismatic career women who majored in economics at the same university. We find that the role model intervention significantly increased female students' likelihood of planning to major in economics (self-reported) and enrolling in further economics classes (administrative data). The women that were impacted by the intervention were previously planning to major in lower-earning fields, suggesting that our low-cost intervention could have a significant impact on the treated womenâ€™s future income streams."
