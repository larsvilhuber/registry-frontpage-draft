abstract: "Australians can claim income tax deductions when they incur costs in the course of earning income (e.g., vehicle and other work-related travel costs). Work related expenses are the most common deduction claimed by Australians. In 2014-15 total claims amounted to a total of $21 billion.

The majority of Australian taxpayers that claim work-related expenses in their income tax returns lodge these forms through a registered tax agent. This trial, delivered in collaboration with the Australian Tax Office (ATO), will test a new method, informed by behavioural insights, aimed at supporting Australians to lodge accurate work related expense claims. The trial will test the effectiveness of a letter sent to tax agents reminding them the ATO has a data analytics system that identifies larger-than-expected claims and encouraging them to review their clients’ claims.
