abstract: "This project aims to investigate how individuals allocate scarce resources across differently weighted connections within networks. Existing literature highlights the effect of influential, resilient, or valuable connections on decision-making. However, empirical evidence in this area is lacking. Utilizing economic experiments, we seek to explore this phenomenon, contributing both theoretically and experimentally. We have designed a novel experiment to induce weighted networks and analyze allocations in various conflict scenarios. Our methodology ensures unique equilibrium predictions, eliminating potential confounds. Our study's findings will be disseminated widely, enriching the understanding of actual strategic resource allocation in network contexts."
