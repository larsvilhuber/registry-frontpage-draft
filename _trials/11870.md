abstract: "This experiment studies how different interventions influence users’ choice of default browser as they are setting up their Windows computer or Android smartphone for the first time. The experiment will take place within an online survey (coded in Qualtrics), and participants will be recruited via panel providers. Upon entering the survey, participants will be asked a series of screening questions (e.g., age, region) and will then be presented with a set of instructions and a comprehension question. The instructions will explain that the participants will need to set up a virtual Windows computer or Android smartphone (depending on the device that they are responding to the survey with) and that they should set up the device in a way that is reflective of what they would do in real-life. Participants will be randomly allocated to different groups as they are completing the device set-up process. More specifically, some participants will be shown an “active choice screen” which prompts participants to choose a default internet browser for their device, and some will not be shown any choice screen (i.e., those in the control group). Those who are randomly allocated to one of the treatment groups (i.e., the groups that are shown an active choice screen) will be allocated to conditions that are shown one of the following: 

T1: An active choice screen with 12 browser options (with drop-downs with brief descriptions) – presented midway through the browser set-up process

T2: An active choice screen with 12 browser options, additional information about the browser options (brief descriptions, star ratings and number of reviews), and an additional information screen that explains what default browsers are – presented midway through the browser set-up process

T3: An active choice screen with 5 browser options, additional information about the browser options (brief descriptions, star ratings and number of reviews), and an additional information screen that explains what default browsers are – presented midway through the browser set-up process

T4: An active choice screen with 5 browser options, additional information about the browser options (brief descriptions, star ratings and number of reviews), and an additional information screen that explains what default browsers are – presented after the device has been set up, when participants open their browser for the first time

The main research question that this study seeks to answer is how the different active choice screens influence browser choice. The study will also explore how the active choice screens influence other factors, such as user satisfaction and the time it takes to complete the device set-up process.
