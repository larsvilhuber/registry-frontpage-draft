abstract: "There is significant policy interest in extending early childhood education in the US, but important gaps remain in our knowledge of the likely impact of such expansions. The North Dakota state legislature recently passed a bill authorizing a series of block-grants that will be released over the next 4 years to improve subsidized early childhood education (ECE) in the state. Our project proposes to partner with the state to evaluate these programs. This study is a pilot designed to assess the feasibility of our research design by exploring power and cost. "
