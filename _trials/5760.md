abstract: "While measurement of agricultural production is critical to empirical development analyses and answering fundamental questions on the role of agriculture in household and individual welfare, there is a lack of understanding about the accuracy of farmer reported crop production and area measurement. In this project, we conduct a large, state-representative survey in Odisha, India containing self-reported and objective measures of agricultural variables to examine the extent of misreporting and measurement error in agricultural area, production, and yield. Using rich data on farmer characteristics, their psychological state, and personality traits, we explore whether misreporting and measurement error are systematically related to these characteristics. Finally, we conduct priming experiments to test if measurement error is affected by incentives to misreport."
