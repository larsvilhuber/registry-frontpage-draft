abstract: "We are conducting an evaluation to better understand the remittance and savings behaviors of international work migrants and their households in Bangladesh. With a randomly selected sample of remittance sender-recipient pairs, we conduct a goal setting exercise to elicit individual savings preferences. We then connect remittance recipients with their migrant counterparts via a group messaging app in order to share their individual savings goals and facilitate agreement on joint goals. We will estimate the impact of the goal-setting treatment on a primary outcome, savings in migrant households held at the partner institution (BRAC Bank). As secondary outcomes, we will examine treatment effects on self-reported savings and remittances sent by the migrant to the remittance recipient. "
