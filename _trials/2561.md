abstract: "In Sub-Saharan Africa, student drop-out, particularly for girls, peaks between primary and secondary school, when schools begin to charge fees and the opportunity cost increases. The researchers use a randomized control trial to study the effect of negotiation training on girls’ educational outcomes in Zambia. Midline findings indicate that the negotiation training significantly improved educational outcomes for the average girl, concentrated among girls in the 60th-80th percentiles of the ability distribution, who are likely on the margin of continuing in school.

The endline will explore secondary school completion rates and university enrollment, as well as the potential interactive effects of improved educational outcomes and negotiation skills on employment and earnings. The endline will also assess spillover effects on siblings’ outcomes."
