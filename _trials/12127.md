abstract: "Early-career researchers (ECRs - PhDs and Post-docs) hold the potential to transform scientific advances into impactful new ventures. However, the prevalent restrictive framing of entrepreneurship as an individual behavior with a monetary reward narrows its appeal to an already preselected profile of a researcher with a preference for economic impact.

In this experiment, we aim to achieve three objectives: 1) establish and measure the effect size of a broader view - focused on impact - of entrepreneurship for ECRs, 2) establish to what extent the perception of entrepreneurship as an individual behavior has a similar restrictive effect, 3a) identify to what extent these alternative framings helps us to activate preferences from researchers across distinct scientific disciplines and research communities, and 3b) understand how individual characteristics, such as identity, growth mindset, or impulsivity help us to understand this differences."
