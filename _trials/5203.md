abstract: "What determines how individuals make trade offs across time periods, and do individuals make these trade offs in an internally consistent matter? We propose to test this by repeatedly remotely eliciting individuals' intertemporal marginal rates of substitution using money earlier or later games. We will randomly assign cash transfers and the interest rate for a financial technology across these individuals. In a neoclassical framework, individuals choices in money earlier or later games and savings decisions using the financial technology should be consistent, implying money earlier or later games can be used to measure the welfare gains from financial technologies and predict technology adoption more broadly."
