abstract: "This trial involves reminder letters for Guatemalan taxpayers that were due to declare their annual income tax for the 2013 tax year, but failed to do so on time. The primary objective of the trial is to increase tax compliance by increasing the number of taxpayers who declare their yearly income tax. The trial is important as Guatemala has the lowest rate of tax collection in Latin America.
Many of the tools available to the governments of developed nations to induce citizens to pay their taxes are not available in Guatemala, and there is a strong need to increase tax revenue in a way that does not itself cost a great deal of money. This makes these interventions, which use behavioural science and are of low or zero cost to implement relative to treatment as usual, potentially very valuable as tools for the tax authority.
The trial involves 43,389 taxpayers, who will be randomly allocated to either receive one of five reminder letters, or be part of a control group. The trial aims to test the differential impact of the original SAT letter, and a simplified letter. We also test for the impact of a social norms message, a message that makes the decision to cheat more salient, and a letter designed to invoke national pride. In addition to declaration the trial will test the impact of the different letters on overall response rates, payment, and payment amount.
