abstract: "Transportation remains a significant barrier to employment for low-income populations, especially for female caregivers who do not have a car. This pre-analysis plan describes a field experiment that will provide a limited-duration car subsidy to approximately 900 low-income mothers in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania who do not have a car. Study participants will be randomly assigned to receive $200 worth of free Uber rides per month for either one month (control) or six months (treatment). Study outcomes include earnings and labor supply, measures of spatial mobility, and receipt of public benefits.
