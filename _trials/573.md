abstract: "Objectives: To test for the feasibility and short-term effectiveness of the office
hysteroscopic-guided pertubal bupivacaine infusion (0.25%) for treating endometriosisassociated
pelvic pain.
Methods: In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled pilot trial, 76 women with
pelvic endometriosis suffering from chronic pelvic pain (CPP) for more than 6 months
and defined as a pain score > VAS 50mm (visual analogue score) were enrolled.
Eligible patients had laparoscopically confirmed pelvic endometriosis (stage I-IV) and
patent fallopian tubes. Sixty CPP patients were randomly assigned to receive either
hysteroscopic-guided pertubal diluted bupivacaine (0.25%) infusion at a single
preovulatory outpatient setting (group I, n=30) or placebo (group II, n=30). Pelvic pain
scores, visual analogue scores and monthly visual rating scales (VRSmonthly) were
assessed at baseline and at 1, 2, and 3 months after joining the protocol. At the end of
the study, women completed a questionnaire designed to evaluate the overall patient
satisfaction rate about the procedure
Results: All patients were available for analysis. After identification, the baseline clinical
characteristics for both groups were comparable. There were statistically significant
improvements from corresponding baseline scores at 1, 2, and 3 months for the VAS,
the VRSmonthly, and the pelvic pain scores in the bupivacaine treated group
compared with placebo (P<.05). Along the 3-months duration of the study, all domains
were demonstrated to be substantially lower than the baseline data. At the end of the
study, women in the bupivacaine group expressed a higher degree of patient
satisfaction that was independent of age, duration or severity of the symptoms (73% vs
7%; P<.05). The procedure was well-tolerated by all patients without any adverse
effects.
Conclusions: Office pertubal hysteroscopic-guided bupivacaine (0.25%) infusion has a
place in the management of women with endometriosis-associated pelvic pain. It offers
a minimally invasive and more cost-effective alternative to current treatments for at
least 3 months.
