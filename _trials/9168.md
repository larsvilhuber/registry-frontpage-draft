abstract: "We present the results of an experiment that documents racial bias on Facebook’s Advertising Platform. We find that darker skin complexions are penalized, leading to real economic consequences. For every $1,000 an advertiser spends on ads with models with light skin complexions, that advertiser would have to spend $1,159 to achieve the same level of engagement using a photo of a darker skin complexion model. Facebook’s budget optimization tool reinforces these viewer biases. When pictures of models with light and dark complexions are allocated a shared budget, Facebook funnels roughly 64% of the budget towards photos featuring lighter skin complexions. Our findings show how neutral algorithmic decisions can complement user bias, and also demonstrate that racial disparities persist in settings where statistical discrimination is a less natural explanation than simple animus."
