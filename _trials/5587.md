abstract: "Who is it that agrees to take the COVID-19 test, when such tests are available? There is a rich literature that shows how people avoid information (including taking health tests), if they do not want to change their current behavior or think they will suffer emotionally. There is reason to believe such selection might be true for the COVID-19 test too. In particular, it might be the people who are the most likely to spread the virus (e.g., “super spreaders”) who are the least likely to get tested. We also examine if the willingness to test depends on the type of self-quarantine recommended (home or away from home) if a test comes back positive. "
