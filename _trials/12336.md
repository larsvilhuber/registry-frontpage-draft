abstract: "In this laboratory experiment, we aim to test the “representation effect” predicted by the dynamic cognitive hierarchy solution (Lin and Palfrey, 2022). Within the family of centipede games, the dynamic cognitive hierarchy solution predicts that players tend to end the game earlier when played according to the extensive form representation compared to the reduced normal form, while players will behave similarly when the game is played according to the extensive form representation and the non-reduced normal form. To test this prediction at the individual level, we employ a within-subject design where each player will participate in a sequence of centipede games under the non-reduced normal form, reduced normal form, and extensive form representations. Specifically, we consider two linear centipede games, two exponential centipede games, and two constant sum centipede games. The order of the representations is controlled, and the payoff parameters are chosen to maximize the informativeness of the experiment."
