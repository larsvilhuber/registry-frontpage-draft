abstract: "Despite advancements toward gender equality in the past century, gender differences in occupational choices remain a strong feature of labor markets around the world. Little is known about effective interventions that counter these gender biased choices in general and about short, low-cost interventions in particular. We conduct a field experiment at a large Swiss private online job board for apprenticeship positions. Adolescent users of the job board are randomly assigned to information on gender-atypical occupations (STEM occupations for women; health and care occupations for men). We estimate whether assignment to the information treatment affects the gender-typicality of adolescentsâ€™ applications for apprenticeship occupations. "
