abstract: "The purpose of this research is to test a set of fundamental economic theories that previously has not been tested experimentally. The main question is the extent to which workers require additional compensation for performing work that is less appealing and, if so, how large this effect is. The research is conducted using the online labor market Amazon's Mechanical Turk. For each experiment, we offered a job on Mechanical Turk and randomly vary the pay offered and the job characteristics. We observe workers once they click on our offered job. Once workers click on the offered job, they are presented with a description of the job and the randomly allocated job characteristics. We then observe whether the worker decides to perform the job and, if so, how much work they do. Once the experiment is over we surveyed the workers to collect basic demographic information (no identifiable information was collected)."
