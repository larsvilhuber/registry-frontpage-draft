abstract: "Developing country contexts are often characterized by informality and clientelism. In such contexts, can making processes more meritocratic improve efficiency? We study these questions with a field experiment in partnership with a large export garment manufacturing firm in Tanzania in the context of an on the job leadership training program offered by the firm. In the status quo system, supervisors and workers have a lot of discretion in who they informally recommend for professional opportunities. As in a classical principal-agent problem, on the one hand, such discretion can lead to more efficient outcomes if supervisors and workers have valuable private information not otherwise available to the firm. On the other hand, such discretion can reduce efficiency if supervisors and workers are biased, make mistakes, or have preferences that are not aligned with the firm’s objectives. To study whether discretion is efficient in this setting, we implement a two-part field experiment. First, we randomize whether supervisors and coworkers are informed of a performance–based referral bonus either before or after they recommend workers for the training program. If discretion is driven by taste-based preferences, or if incentives are misaligned between the firm and employees to begin with, then ex-ante bonus announcements should reduce inefficient discretion and result in higher quality referrals. If discretion is instead driven by genuine mistakes, statistical-based preferences, or if incentives are already aligned between the firm and employees, then ex-ante bonus announcements will have no effect or could even worsen the quality of referrals. To study the labor supply-side response to discretion, we also randomize whether applications to the training program emphasize that selection will be based on supervisor discretion (referrals) or objective, meritocratic measures (past performance records). Taken together, our study examines the efficiency of discretion in a labor context in which informal social relationships are paramount. "
