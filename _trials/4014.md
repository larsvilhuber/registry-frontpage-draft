abstract: "We conduct a country-wide field experiment with unemployed job seekers in Denmark. Our experiment makes use of a new online information tool through which the Danish employment agency provides online job search assistance. The online tool - a dashboard containing different information cards - is embedded on the landing page reached by job seekers after they log in to the public portal of the Danish employment agency (jobnet.dk). In our experiment, we exogenously vary the content of the information tool across four groups of job seekers: a control group receives generic information on the functionalities of
the job portal. A second group receives additional information about the number of vacancies available in the occupations stored by job seekers in their personal search profile. The third treatment group receives referrals to occupations that are related to the ones specified in their personal search profile. A fourth group of job
seekers receives both vacancy information and occupational referrals. We will analyze the effects of our treatments using administrative data
on individuals' job search behavior and subsequent labor market outcomes."
