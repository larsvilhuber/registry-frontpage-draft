abstract: "In this project, I run an online experiment to shed light on two potential drivers of self-stereotypical behavior: statistical and taste-based self-stereotyping. With the former I refer to individuals using stereotypes about a group to which they belong to draw conclusions about their own abilities. Taste-based self-stereotyping I define as describing individualsâ€™ intrinsic preferences to act in accordance with stereotypes. In my project, I am explicitly analysing preferences for self-stereotypical behavior and statistical self-stereotyping in the same setting. To do so, I conduct an online experiment."
