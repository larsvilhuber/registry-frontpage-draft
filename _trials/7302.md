abstract: "The Australian Financial Security Authority (AFSA) manages the personal bankruptcy application process in Australia. Declaring bankruptcy is a significant and at times stressful decision for most people. BETA and AFSA are working together to ensure people understand the consequences of applying for bankruptcy, and should they decide to proceed, the process is as straightforward as possible."
