abstract: "Baul singersâ€™ alienation from digital music production methods means that it is difficult for them to turn out the same quality of songs as, and collaborate with, modern musicians. We are investigating what precisely Baul singers lose in the digital recording process; what challenges does a folk singer face in adapting to different current technologies, specifically, ensemble vs. click-track; is an ability to improvise the creative backbone of Baul music, or is it the synergy value of an ensemble performance, or both; does a change in environment (comfort) change performance quality via increased/decreased confidence, and if so, for whom? Also, how is the music produced itself affected as a result of these new digital technologies?"
