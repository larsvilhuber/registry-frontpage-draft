abstract: "We conduct a large-scale online survey experiment to study which remedies facilitate the distinction between false and correct information on social media. In particular, we examine the short-term, long-term, and spillover effects of fact check vs. media literacy interventions on participants’ factual knowledge, behavioral intentions, and the perceived credibility of information retrieved from social media. To this end, we expose participants to false and correct statements that we retrieve from Facebook. Then, we compare participants who obtain a brief media literacy training in terms of Facebook’s “Tips how to spot false news" before being exposed to the Facebook posts with participants who receive fact checks that debunk the false statements. As far as we know, we are the first who pursue a clean and sophisticated comparison of fact check and media literacy interventions as a means to debunk “fake news.”"
