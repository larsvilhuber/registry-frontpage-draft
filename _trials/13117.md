abstract: "I study the impact of a non-resident tuition lottery that randomized nonresident supplemental tuition fees among 1,333 students from 45 countries who were admitted to a leading American research university that was a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU). I will estimate the impact of nonresident tuition on enrollment rates, tuition recovery, degree attainment, immigration patterns, and innovation using pre-specified methods and outcome measures that will be collected and linked to the dataset in the coming months. I will then estimate the long-run external costs and benefits of nonresident tuition using pre-specified calculations."
