abstract: "This study intends to investigate the role of social comparison in investment decisions. We will follow Apesteguia et al (2020) in designing the study with one major change: adding treatments on social comparison.  Our control condition is similar to the control condition of Apesteguia et al (2020).  However, in treatment conditions, we inform subjects about their ranking relative to the selected baseline group.  In the downward (upward) social comparison treatment, we will compare the results of subjects to a lower (higher) distribution.  We expect that the number of risky assets choices will be higher in the upward comparison treatment compared to the downward comparison condition.
