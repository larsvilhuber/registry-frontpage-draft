abstract: "Driven by technological innovations, political campaigning has increasingly shifted online. Vast amounts of available data enable microtargeting of campaign messages to small groups of potential voters. This development was met with public suspicion and calls for stricter government control. In this study, we investigate one potential driver of public opposition to online political campaigning. We propose an experiment that links peoples' beliefs about the effects that targeted political advertising has on voters of the opposing party to their demand for stricter government regulation of it. We plan to show that people believe that the opposing party gains more from the use of targeted political advertising than their own party. We furthermore attempt to establish a causal link between peoples' beliefs about the effect of targeted political advertisement and their support for government regulation. "
