abstract: "Even in developed countries, there are large differences in gender norms regarding the labor market participation of mothers and fathers. In this project, we investigate how norms on primary caregiving depend on pre-birth labor market incomes of mothers and fathers. To that end, we implement an online-survey experiment among a representative sample of adults aged 18 to 69 years in Germany. All respondents are presented with a vignette describing the situation of a couple expecting their first child, in which they learn that after the childâ€™s birth one parent will stay at home to take care of the child whereas the other parent will work for pay full-time. One group of respondents receives no further information. Three experimental groups receive additional information about pre-birth labor market incomes of both parents. In a fifth group, we additionally ask respondents to assume that for the first 8 weeks after birth both the father and the mother will stay at home. All respondents are then asked whether the young mother or the young father should stay at home to take care about the child while the other parent works full-time."
