abstract: "Participants in various social programs in Australia have the opportunity to apply for a Change of Assessment (CoA) when they experience a change in circumstances. This is done by lodging an application with the Australian Government's Department of Human Services (DHS).  This study will examine the effects of SMS messages informing applicants that their application has been received and that they will be contacted when it has been progressed. This project will increase process transparency in order to alleviate client concerns and anxiety about the progress of their application. The intended impact of the messages is to save client time as they do not need to call to check on the status of their application. If effective in reducing call volumes, the messages may also create efficiency gains for DHS Service Officers.
