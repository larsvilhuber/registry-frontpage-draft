abstract: "People’s preference for making their own decisions rather than being dominated by others is at the heart of liberal democracies. This aversion to dominance might be reduced by threats to their physical safety, economic status, or gender and racial identity. We study the extent to which individuals prefer not to be dominated using three measures: (1) Directly measuring willingness to pay to avoid being “dominated,” or yielding control over some aspect of their lives to another party, via an experiment called the “Boss Game,” (2) Eliciting willingness to donate to anti-authoritarian causes, and (3) Survey data on preferences for authoritarianism and political engagement. We examine whether people’s aversion to being dominated is weakened when their physical and economic safety, and identity are threatened."
