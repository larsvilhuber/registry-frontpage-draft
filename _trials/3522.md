abstract: "The setting in which willingness to compete is commonly studied in the lab differs from real- life competitive settings along two important dimensions (Niederle and Vesterlund, 2007),(Buser, Niederle, and Oosterbeek, 2014), (Almås, Cappelen, Salvanes, Sørensen, and Tungodden, 2016). 1. Competing in real life creates losers 2. Competing in real life either means competing against a selective group of people who also want to compete (selection) or forcing others into competition (forcing). We want to investigate whether these dimensions matter to people when deciding whether to compete and whether these dimensions have an impact on the gender difference in tournament
entry that is robustly found in the classical setting. This leads to the following research questions: 1. Are people more reluctant to compete if winning the competition creates a loser? 2. Do people take into account the selective nature of competition? That is, are they less likely to compete when competition is against others who have self-selected into competition? 3. Do men and women react differently to these factors? Furthermore, the competitiveness literature so far largely ignores issues of fairness. The same person might be willing to compete when competition is fair and refuse to compete when it is seems unfair. On the other hand, some people might be happy to compete when they receive an unfair advantage. Finally, in some settings, such as the workplace, starting to act competitively with others might force these others to compete themselves. The present study also provides an initial investigation of these issues."
