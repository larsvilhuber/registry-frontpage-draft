abstract: "We examine the impact of systematic phonics instruction on low-SES seventh grade early readersâ€™ English reading ability in rural China using a teacher-level randomized experiment. English teachers in the treatment group received systematic phonics training, while teachers in the control group used the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). We aim to examine whether the new English teaching method has more significant effect on children's reading achievement."
