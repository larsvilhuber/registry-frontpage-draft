abstract: "Family Promise of West Michigan, Family Promise of Spokane, and the Lordâ€™s Place (located in West Palm Beach) are three nonprofit organizations dedicated to fighting homelessness in their local communities. As part of this mission, these organizations participate in diversion conversations with clients who are experiencing housing crises, searching for solutions that could keep them out of homeless shelters. These organizations and LEO want to examine the impact of supplementing these conversations with additional support and resources. In a randomized controlled trial, eligible clients will be randomly assigned to receive either a diversion conversation alone, a diversion conversation with flexible financial assistance available, or a diversion conversation, flexible financial assistance, and proactive follow-up case management. Researchers will track the outcomes of those in each treatment group who receive additional support and those in the control group who receive only the standard diversion conversation in order to make conclusions about the effectiveness of these new support services.
