abstract: "The BYCBI was developed by the Boston Mayor’s Office of Financial Empowerment (OFE) and implemented by Working Credit NFP over the course of one year from March/April of 2016 through March/April of 2017. OFE recruited participants for the study during the two months prior to the start of the program, targeting low-income young adults, age 18-29, who were currently working or in a workforce development program. The goal of the program was to help individuals build strong credit scores by increasing their knowledge of credit building, supplying them with credit building and saving products, and providing individualized advice through coaching over the course of one year. The treatment included a financial workshop, one-on-one coaching, and the opportunity to enroll in the CW-3™ credit building product, a secured loan and savings product if they met certain criteria. Since the number of individuals applying for the program exceeded the number ultimately selected for participation (N=300), we were able to randomly assign participation in the program with half assigned to the treatment group and half applied to the control group. In addition, we stratified our random assignment by age (18-24 versus 25-29), race (African-American versus non-African-American), and gender (male versus female) to test for heterogeneity in treatment effects, which have been shown to be important in prior studies. The treatment group received the financial workshop and the one-on-one coaching. They were also offered the CW-3TM product if it was deemed appropriate given their current financial situation and credit history (a total of 19 participants were ultimately enrolled in the CW-3TM product). The control group received no intervention at all. To evaluate outcomes, we employed a mixed-methods approach using both quantitative information from administrative data and surveys, as well as more narrative qualitative information gathered from focus groups."
