Photos of models are the biggest source of information available to online shoppers. We study if showing representative fashion models on retail platforms has any effect on users. Do customers care that the platforms are trying to be inclusive? We partnered with an apparel rental company to run a field experiment. The onboarding process for this subscription service requires new users to fill out a “style quiz” where they indicate their style preferences and then input their sizes.  Our treatment will happen immediately after this step. On the next page, we will show them photos of a model on an image carousel. We will have four treatments: a) where the model is the closest to their size b) just the small-sized model c) only plus-sized models d)status-quo. We will measure subscription and user engagement on the platform as outcomes.
