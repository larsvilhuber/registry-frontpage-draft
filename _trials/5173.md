abstract: "We study the effect of increasing community monitoring on the evolution of public investment projects. Specifically, we study the impact of the launching of the website MapaInversiones in Costa Rica on the percentage of budget used and on the physical progress of public investment projects. Mapainversiones is an online platform where government agencies are required to upload information about the public investment projects they are conducting. After the release of the website, all the information about the public investment projects was available to the public. This decreased the cost of monitoring for the citizens, making it easier to check the status of the public investment projects. "
