abstract: "The main aim of this experiment is to measure the effectiveness of a senior peer tutoring intervention in higher education at improving students' educational performance. Student organizations in law and engineering organize peer-assisted learning sessions (PAL) to first year students taught by senior peers for the most difficult courses. Because these tutoring sessions are oversubscribed, we randomly allocate students to treatment and control groups after initial enrolment. We vary the treatment by group size, and, potentially, in the second semester, by ability grouping or a different variable. The primary outcome variables is students' performance on that course using administrative data. We also consider some heterogeneity in treatment effect and secondary outcome variables, though this will depend on the obtained sample size and the level of over subscription. The final pre-analysis plan will be uploaded after students have registered for the tutoring intervention, but before outcome variables are collected. In this way, no p-hacking is possible, while still allowing me to demonstrate my initial intentions."
