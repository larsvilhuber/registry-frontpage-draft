abstract: "Reach Up and Learn (RUL) is a home-visiting program that was introduced in Jamaica in 1975. The program was later adapted to serve Syrian refugees in the Syrian Response region and implemented by the International Rescue Committee. Originally, the intervention was delivered in-person by a number of Community Health Volunteers (CHVs). However, recently it has been adapted to be delivered over the phone due to the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The activities were adapted to be delivered on the phone to caregivers to provide caregivers with stimulation activities they can do with their children using basic household items (plastic bottles, bottlecaps, plastic containers…etc.) Specifically, CHVs will recruit caregivers from their social networks and enlist them in the program. They will then call them three times a month to (1) check in on their well-being; (2) deliver health messages and (3) tell them about the stimulation activities. The calls are scripted to ensure consistency of messages being relayed to caregivers. The program aims to serve children from 6-36 months of age among Syrian and Jordanian households in Mafraq, Amman, Irbid & Ramtha governorates in Jordan. Our research focuses on Irbid and Ramtha only. Each age group is composed of two-month intervals (6-8 months, 9-11 months…etc.) resulting in 10 age groups with each age group having 8 scripts for a total of 80 scripts across all age groups. "
