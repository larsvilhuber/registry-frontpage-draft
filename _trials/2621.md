abstract: "In this study, we test theoretical predictions in the contract theory and personnel economics literature that subjective performance evaluations could suffer from two major issues: (1) delegation to an evaluating leader could induce favoritism and influence activities, which could be solved by creating ex ante uncertainty in the identity of the evaluating leader; and (2) principal and agent could have misaligned beliefs about the agent's performance, which could be solved by creating timely feedback between them.
We partner with provincial governments in Henan Province and Guangdong Province in China, and conduct a field experiment by randomly imposing different evaluation schemes to 4000 College Graduates Village Officials (CGVOs) in these two provinces.  Having informed each CGVO at the beginning of the evaluation year about what his evaluation scheme would be, we observe whether his performance would change accordingly over the evaluation year, as predicted by theory. We use non-incentivized dimensions of performance as benchmark measures for welfare."
