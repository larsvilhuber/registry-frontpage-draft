abstract: "In queuing situations with prioritization based on self-reported need, the literature often turns to priority pricing as a method for aligning incentives properly. The approach for determining the optimal priority prices typically assumes that individuals will always lie if it will maximize their payoff. However, a recent meta-analysis of experiments on truth-telling reveals that people have an innate preference for being honest and for being seen as honest and, hence, tend to lie substantially less than expected. In light of the above, in this experiment I aim to test the behavioral responses to priority pricing and its effects on populations with differing underlying propensities for truth-telling."
