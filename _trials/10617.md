abstract: "Racial disparities exist at every stage of the U.S. criminal justice system and are particularly prominent in the setting of bail. In settings like Harris County, TX, black defendants are more than 34 percent more likely to be detained compared to whites. In this project, we are testing the effectiveness of detailed private feedback and personalized tips to judges in New York State; Dallas County, TX; and Bexar County, TX. The private feedback will consist of the judgesâ€™ own outcomes over time, giving them the motivation, information, and tools necessary to reduce racial disparities in their pretrial decisions. We will estimate the causal effect of this intervention on pretrial release and misconduct rates using a randomized control trial.
