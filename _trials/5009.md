abstract: "We aim to test whether giving parents access to information on their children’s learning progress through an education app, as well as personalized, specific, and informative notifications and actionable recommendations improves pupils’ effort in working through problems and misconceptions, ultimately improving their achievement in maths. This project will allow us to test the effect of parents’ having access to the parent app, independently from the children's access to the Eedi homework platform (which is currently being evaluated in an Education Endowment Foundation project). This evaluation will be achieved through a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial: classes are randomized into treatment or control, and parents of pupils in treatment classes receive access to Eedi's parent app. We will test math achievement as measured through Eedi's quiz results as our main outcome, and will also assess student effort measures as secondary outcomes. And implementation process evaluation will be conducted to assess fidelity and compliance as well as to better understand participants’ lived experiences of the app notifications and subsequent interactions between pupils and their parents."
