abstract: "Although different forms of Value Added Taxes have been implemented in several countries, effective implementation is constrained by state capacity. One form of deviation from effective implementation is large-scale non-compliance of filing requirements by the eligible tax payers. According to the official Indian government data, the cumulative (on time + delayed) filing of various tax forms in Delhi--the context of this study--is around 75% in February 2021. The on-time filing rate is around 55 percent. 

This study nudges the taxpayers to file their pending returns and file their future returns on-time in a developing country context. The nudges take the form of electronic calls. During the intervention, we randomize the content of the messages to determine their relative effectiveness. Relatedly, we also analyse the effect of the non-compliance of a firm's business partners on its own compliance behaviour. The project has policy relevance since frequent communications from the tax department are costly in terms in monetary costs and impose a cognitive burden on the taxpayers. By measuring the persistence of the treatment effects, we can potentially comment on the optimal frequency of sending nudges to the taxpayers."
