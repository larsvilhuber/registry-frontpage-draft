abstract: "This study offers a rigorous evaluation of two types of training programs offered to women entrepreneurs in Ethiopia who are part of the World Bankâ€™s Women Entrepreneurship Development Project (WEDP). The impact evaluation will examine the effectiveness of a psychology-focused training (Personal Initiative (PI)) as well as a more standard business training (Business Skills and Entrepreneurship Development (BSED)), to provide evidence on the impact of varied approaches to entrepreneurship training.
