abstract: "According to the World Bank, the lack of socio-emotional skills among adults in Peru hinders their ability to become and stay employed. Moreover, this research suggests that socio-emotional skills are essential for improving the quality of life of all Peruvians, as people with higher socio-emotional skills have increased long-term income potential, improved health, are more engaged in their community, and ultimately, are happier. Researchers partnered with the Ministry of Education to measure the effectiveness of Escuela Amiga, a large-scale government program designed to develop the socio-emotional skills of students in at-risk schools in Peru."
