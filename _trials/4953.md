abstract: "We test if performance scorecards can increase municipal government performance. In a field experiment in Burkina Faso, local decision makers are provided with a scorecard that provides information on national performance standards and on the municipality's actual performance along 16 indicators of service delivery and institutional capacity. Municipal officials are asked to internally assign responsibilities for each performance indicator and are made aware that their performance is being monitored. "
