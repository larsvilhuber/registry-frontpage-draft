abstract: "Under the Right to Education Act passed in 2009, which came into effect in April 2010, every child from the age of six to fourteen is guaranteed free and compulsory education, and no child can be held back, expelled or required to pass a board examination until the completion of elementary education. The Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation scheme was formulated under the Act to replace test-based evaluations in government schools, with a view to introduce a more uniform and comprehensive pattern of assessment in education for children, as well as to decrease the accumulated stress of board exams and year-end assessments. The impact of CCE, however, has never been evaluated. The first arm of this study, undertaken in collaboration between J-PAL and the government of Haryana, examines whether training teachers to implement CCE and distributing the right material leads to (1) adoption of continuous evaluation (2) changes in pedagogy and (3) any change in learning. The second arm of this study evaluates the impact of another intervention conducted in the same set of schools, in collaboration between Pratham and the government of Haryana. One hour per day, students are organized not by formal grade but by level of competencies, and teachers are taught to focus on remedial learning adapted to students in each group. The study will examine whether training the teachers in this method, and supporting them with regular visits leads to (1) adoption of the "teaching at the right level method" and (2) changes in learning.
