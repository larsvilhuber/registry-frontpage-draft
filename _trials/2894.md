abstract: "Americans are increasingly exposed to news and information that confirms instead of challenges their pre-existing viewpoints. Why do we tend to demand ideologically aligned news? Theory and laboratory evidence suggest two broad groups of mechanisms that may play a key role. The first is psychological mechanisms leading to a â€œtaste for consistency," which entails that partisans will be seek ideologically aligned sources even if this means choosing sources which they know to be less accurate. The second mechanism is rational updating that leads partisans to infer that sources which agree with their prior beliefs are likely to be more accurate. Distinguishing the relative importance of these two mechanisms is crucial for understanding how media consumption will evolve and what changes in policy or platforms will be most likely to lead to more accurate beliefs. We aim to use a field experiment to precisely identify the importance of trust vs. taste for consistency in generating selective exposure."
