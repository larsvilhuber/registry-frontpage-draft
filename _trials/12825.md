abstract: "Although 80 percent of entering and community college studies aspire to earn a bachelor's degree, most do not earn an associate degree or early transfer to a four-year college. The college application process, which can be complex, time-consuming, and uncertain, may contribute to the low transfer rates. Prior research suggests that reducing uncertainty using clear and guaranteed payoffs can encourage individuals to undertake high-effort and challenging behavior.

This study explores the impact of reducing uncertainty in college admissions, particularly for students who have less access to advising and support during the college application process. What is the impact of guaranteed admissions on community college studentsâ€™ four-year transfer choices? Does the type of admissions guarantee matter? To answer these questions, I evaluate the impact of the Common Transfer Guarantee (CTG), an initiative in which four-year colleges admit community college transfer students based on college academic performance or the college they attended. The CTG, which was hosted by the Common App during the 2021-2022 application cycle, informed community college students who registered on their application portal about four-year colleges where they likely qualify for guaranteed admissions."
