abstract: "Blight and crime are detrimental to the physical, mental, and social health of individuals and communities. Blight (e.g. physical disorder, vacant structures) gives the impression of low levels of social cohesion and provides concealed spaces in which criminal activity has been shown to occur. There is growing evidence that place-based interventions may successful and sustainable in improving wellbeing by changing the structures of places that enable crime and blight to remain persistently high. This place-based intervention brings together public servants and community partners for intensive and rapid beautification and restoration, outreach and education, and codes and law enforcement focused on blocks in distressed neighborhoods. The program runs May-October, targeting clusters of 200 properties each week. The goal is to eliminate blight and foster block-level community connections in order to improve residents’ wellbeing. However, there has been no prior research on the causal impact of the initiative. In this study, we will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of blight remediation and community outreach, as delivered through the intervention, on residents’ wellbeing. Wellbeing measured through a panel survey. This study will produce evidence regarding the impact of city-led, place-based initiatives to tackle blight, reduce crime, and improve wellbeing.
