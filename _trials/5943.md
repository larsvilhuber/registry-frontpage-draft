abstract: "A key argument for policy competition between sub-national entities is that direct comparison of policy outcomes yields efficient public service provision. However, the necessary condition to reap these efficiency gains – that voters can observe policy outcomes – is often not fulfilled. A case in point is the education system of Germany, where the legislative and executive power over public education is vested in the federal states, but regular cross-state comparative student assessment data is largely lacking. To study the underlying political-economy reasons for lacking comparability across states, we conduct parallel surveys among German state parliamentarians and German citizens.
We elicit citizens’ preferences for comparability in a representative online survey with 10,000 respondents who are randomly assigned to one of five experimental groups. Respondents in group 1 state their (i) satisfaction with their state’s education policy, and (ii) support for comparability-enhancing policies without receiving any information. Respondents in groups 2 and 3 answer the same questions after being informed about their state’s educational performance relative to the other German states. Respondents in groups 4 and 5 have the option to retrieve educational performance information through clicking on a link before answering the outcome questions. The experimental results will shed light on the determinants of public support for enhanced comparative testing of education outcomes, which is a necessary condition to foster education-policy competition.
