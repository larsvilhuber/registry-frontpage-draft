abstract: "The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment is a randomized evaluation of the effect of expanding access to Medicaid. In 2008, the state of Oregon drew names by lottery for its Medicaid program for low-income, uninsured adults. This ongoing study represents a collaborative effort between researchers and the state of Oregon to use this opportunity to learn about the impact of Medicaid on a variety of outcomes including health care use, health outcomes, financial strain, and well-being of low income adults."
