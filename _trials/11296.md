abstract: "The growing reliance on social media as the primary source of news has raised concerns about the quality, credibility, and diversity of news content consumed by users. While prior research has focused on the impact of algorithms, political polarization, and misinformation, there is limited evidence regarding the effectiveness of nudges in promoting engagement with original news agencies on social media platforms. In this study, participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: one receiving an email encouraging them to follow original news agencies on social media, and the other receiving the same email with hyperlinks to the news agencies' social media pages. We will test whether these nudges enhance individuals' engagement with original news agencies on social media platforms and if this leads to a more informed audience. This study can provide valuable evidence for policymakers and social media platforms interested in promoting informed news consumption and combating misinformation and filter bubbles."
