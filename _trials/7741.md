abstract: "I present a theory on non-linear Public Goods. The Game has a continuum of Nash equilibria in the interior of strategy space which depend on the degree of curvature and what players belief others will contribute. I will use laboratory experiments to test the theory: average contributions in non-linear Games are higher than in quasi-linear Games."
