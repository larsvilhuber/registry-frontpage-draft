abstract: "We study the effect of health awareness campaigns on cognitive load  and behavioral preferences implementing a ﬁeld experiment with a representative sample of adult individuals residing in Cairo, Egypt. Participants in a door-to-door survey were assigned to watch videos about a commonly spread and highly contagious disease aﬀecting children or a placebo video. Consistent with dual process theories, we ﬁnd that the health awareness video impaired cognition of the targeted population in terms of lower scores on cognitive ability and ﬂuid intelligence tests compared with the control group. The results show that participants who experienced ﬁnancial and health stress in their daily life were mostly aﬀected by the treatment. The ﬁndings emphasize the need to account for cognitive taxation when designing interventions and determining target beneﬁciaries."
