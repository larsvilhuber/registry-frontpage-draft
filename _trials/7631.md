abstract: "Notwithstanding the recommendations of the Italian Ministry of Labour and Social Policies, the development of fully ﬂedged programmes for integration of asylum seekers in Italy has not mirrored the overwhelming number of arrivals in reception centres. Pilot studies are needed to inform policy at the national level and to improve the opportunities of social and labour market integration for asylum seekers. The present project deploys a new model of integration which we pilot in Piedmont, a large region of Northern Italy characterized by an integration model for asylum seekers based on widespread territorial reception in small centres.

The intervention oﬀers to asylum seekers the assistance of a mentor for the creation of an individualized integration plan consisting in an initial skills assessment, in the offer of Italian short language and vocational training courses and, finally, in professional assistance for job search.

The effectiveness of this intervention package on labour market and social integration outcomes will be evaluated via a clustered randomized controlled trial with blocking. All eligible managing host structures will be included in the experimental sample. Given the peculiarity of the Piedmont system outlined above, randomization will be performed at the asylum seekers’ managing entity level. Expected outcomes will be measured by integrating quantitative data from administrative sources and ad-hoc surveys.
