abstract: "The role of social information in shaping decisions and behaviors is well-documented across many domains. This influence extends to workplace environments, where studies have extensively documented how relative performance feedback affects workers' effort and performance. Notwithstanding, an important question that remains largely underexplored is whether workers actually value such social information and the purposes for which it is used. This study explores the broader welfare implications of social information in workplace settings, focusing particularly on whether workers value this information for its instrumental value, how it affects morale by fostering competition, or how it gives rise to fairness concerns."
