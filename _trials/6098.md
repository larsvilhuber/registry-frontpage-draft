abstract: "This research project aims to understand to what extent edutainment targeted at men, at women, or at both jointly, changes attitudes, beliefs, norms, and behavior about child marriage and education for girls.  We conduct a cluster randomized control trial in 177 rural villages in Pakistan where villages are randomly assigned to either receive no edutainment intervention, edutainment targeted at men and boys, edutainment targeted at women and girls, or edutainment targeted at both genders. The intervention is delivered by Oxfam Pakistan in collaboration with its local implementing partners. In each village, we collect baseline and endline data, as well as longitudinal village-level administrative data on marriages and education. Per village we survey 10 randomly selected households with adolescent children, and per household we survey male and female caregivers, as well as one female or male adolescent child. Each household member also takes part in lab-in-the-field experiments through which we elicit individual beliefs, as well as their preferences for investments in the adolescent child. "
