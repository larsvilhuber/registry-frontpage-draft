abstract: "We study the willingness of individuals to participate in clinical trials under various circumstances. We ask individuals to imagine a medical circumstance, a set of available treatments with a given evidence base, including a clinical drug trial that is testing a specific medication. We then ask respondents how they would choose to address the medical circumstance. We seek to understand which traits of the individual, their circumstance, and trial best predict willingness to enroll in a trial.
