abstract: "We run a stated choice experiment to estimate preferences for network members among university freshmen. In the experiment, newly enrolled students at a large German university state for a number of ficticious profiles of fellow students whether or not they consider subjects with the respective profiles as potential network partners. Using this data, we plan to estimate to what extent homophily shapes network preferences."
