abstract: "We conducted two matching grant fundraising experiments with an international development charity. Using a sample of non-prior donors, the primary experiment finds that a matching grant offered by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation raises more funds than a matching grant offer from an anonymous donor. The effect is strongest for donors who previously gave to other poverty-oriented charities. This is consistent with a quality signal mechanism, although alternative mechanisms are not ruled out. The results help clarify why people give to charity, what models help to describe those motivations, and how practitioners can leverage large donors to increase their fundraising potential."
