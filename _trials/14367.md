abstract: "An extensive literature highlights the use of willful ignorance as moral wiggle room to protect one's self-image when choosing to behave selfishly. Although the literature is highly suggestive that people care about their own, internalized self-image, people frequently compare themselves with others when evaluating their own conduct. In the context of willful ignorance, an ignorant person could claim "I am not a bad person for not knowing because there are many others who also did not know." Accordingly, the use of ignorance to mitigate guilt or shame implies different social norms, contingent upon individuals' beliefs about how others may choose to acquire undesirable information. Given the richness of our social environments and our tendency for “social learning,” it is likely the case that the degree to which we exploit moral wiggle room is a function of how we perceive others to behave, with the caveat that such beliefs may be inherently self-serving. Studying the role of beliefs about social norms offers both a broader understanding of the moral wiggle room phenomena and potential mechanisms for addressing willful ignorance. The main goal of this study is an exploration of the interaction between beliefs about social norms and the tendency to exploit ignorance for selfish gains. We present an experiment that studies norming behavior within the moral wiggle room paradigm, using a design that exogenously manipulates subjects’ prior beliefs about social norms."
