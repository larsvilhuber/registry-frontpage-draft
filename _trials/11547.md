abstract: "We will examine how 11-15 years old students from the lower tracks of secondary school in Germany (plan to) choose their post-secondary career tracks and fields of occupation. Combining survey, experimental, and econometric methods, we will study the origins of students’ plans in one unified framework, examining the relative importance of i) preferences for different career aspects, ii) beliefs about these career aspects across different tracks and fields, and iii) perceived external pressure from parents and peers. We actively involve both parents and peers to analyze to what extent they shape students’ preferences and beliefs and influence choices directly through perceived pressure. Focusing on young students of ages 11 to 15 is crucial to identify at what ages students start forming preferences and beliefs relevant to their choices and at what age external pressures are active and internalized. This is also the age at which most professional orientation programs take place in schools. "
