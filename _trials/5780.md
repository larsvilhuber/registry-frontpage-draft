abstract: "Preventive behaviors such as hand washing, social distancing and respiratory hygiene are key to containing the spread of COVID-19, particularly in densely populated areas of developing countries with crowded living quarters and public spaces. We use phone-based messages to encourage these healthful behaviors at-scale in Bihar, India. Using the "exploration sampling" approach, we will identify the most effective combinations of content and timing/frequency in increasing the adoption of preventative measures."
