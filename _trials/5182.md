abstract: "Handwashing could prevent over a million children from dying each year. At the same time, tooth decay is
the most common preventable chronic illness. It affects an estimated 60â€“90% of schoolchildren and nearly
100% of adults worldwide, according to the WHO Global Oral Health Database. Standard health
interventions provide supplies and information, but usually lead to only modest behavior change.
Hygiene Heroes, a partnership of UC Berkeley and IIT Madras, has been developing a health education
program for Tamil Nadu schools since 2014 (http://hygieneheroes.berkeley.edu/). Our curriculum has vivid
activities, engaging stories and simple routines to teach, change norms and increase safe behaviors.
We will run a randomized controlled trial in 200 schools in Taml Nadu. We will implement the curriculum for
handwashing with soap in half the schools and the curriculum for brushing teeth with fluoride toothpaste in
the other half of schools. Our intervention targets students and teachers. It teaches new behaviors and
routines, changes attitudes. We also provide a low-cost soapy bottle that cost only 20% as much as bars
of soap (about $0.04 / student per year)."
