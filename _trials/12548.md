abstract: "Despite the penetration of mobile money across many emerging economies, cash continues to dominate retail payments. Following from a canonical literature on two-sided markets, customers and merchants face coordination problems in adopting a two-sided platform, such as digital retail payments. In partnership with a leading mobile network operator in Tanzania, we test the efficacy of locally-targeted adoption and referral incentives to catalyze adoption of digital retail payments. This experiment will be one of the first to quantify the causal effects of merchant-customer coordination on digital payments adoption."
