abstract: "To what extent can providing information and supportive services encourage high school graduates to attend a more selective postsecondary institution? The College Board administered a large randomized control trial, using approximately 785,000 low- and middle-income students in the top 50% of the PSAT and SAT distributions. The goal was to reduce or eliminate informational or behavioral barriers in the college application process by providing easily digestible information on a set of academically strong colleges to minimize the costs to students of aggregating data, encourage a broader college application portfolio, and provide an impetus to start the college search process. Some randomly assigned students received additional supports including offers for text message reminders, virtual advising, or financial incentives such as college application fee waivers. "
