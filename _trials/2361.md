abstract: "Mathematics intervention 2017 investigates the impact of TMTM. TMTM is a mathematics intervention programme for marginal groups in Danish Elementary Schools. The programme seeks to improve the mathematical skills/competences and motivation of students in the 2. and 8 grade through a dialogue-based approach to mathematics teaching. 
These are the key elements in TMTM:
-	A four day TMTM teacher course that aims to give the teachers knowledge and practical experiences with the TMTM intervention model.
-	A pre-test of the students to identity the 20 % lowest achieving students and 20 % highest achieving students.
-	A 12 weeks intervention period in which the teachers teach the identified students 4 times a week. 
-	A post-test of the students. 
In some of the treatment arms the intervention also involves: 
-	A three day Supervision course for matematikvejledere (math teachers who guide and supervise the other math teachers at the school). 
-	Supervision of the teachers by the matematikvejleder during the intervention period.
