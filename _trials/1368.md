abstract: "Workplace wellness programs have become a $6 billion industry and are widely touted as a way to improve employee well-being, reduce health care costs by promoting prevention, and increase workplace productivity. Yet, there is little rigorous evidence available to support these claims, partly because the voluntary nature of these programs means that participants may differ from nonparticipants for reasons unrelated to the causal effects of the wellness program. We will implement a randomized control trial to identify the effects of incentives on wellness program participation, produce causal estimates of the effect of wellness programs on health outcomes, determine what kinds of employees benefit from wellness programs the most, and test for the presence of peer effects in wellness participation."
