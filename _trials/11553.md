abstract: "Do relational mobility affect people's degree of altruism in prisoner's dilemma? In this study, subjects are matched in pairs to play repeated prisoner's dilemma, and some subjects are allowed to change partners (i.e. they are relationally mobile). The study aims to investigate whether mobile players more altruistic or less, and how much of people's altruism can be attributed to mobility as opposed to other factors.

In terms of data collection, I will send out surveys to ask for people's game strategies, and subjects will be informed whether they have relational mobility or not prior to specifying their strategies. I will then collect their strategies, pay the subjects by the amount of money their strategies generate, and look at how different game conditions change the strategies submitted by the subjects."
