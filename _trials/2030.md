abstract: "Does providing recognition to well-performing teachers make them better teachers? We study this issue using a randomized controlled trial. Following midterm assessment of teachers by students, we give private recognition to a random subset of teachers who score well (above an ex-ante decided threshold). Recognition is given during a personal phone call between the teacher and a representative of the employer. In addition to the average treatment effect, we also examine some of the mechanisms that can drive the treatment effect. For that purpose, we use questionnaires and incentivized games to collect data on teachers' reciprocity (several types), conditional altruism towards the employer, and reputation concerns. "
