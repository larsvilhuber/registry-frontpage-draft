abstract: "Norway is known for its supportive welfare state. A well-functioning support system for people in need is part of the Norwegian identity. To maintain this status, it is important that everyone is treated equally and fairly. In this research project, we ask Norwegian social workers and prospective social workers to categorize typical welfare applications. We randomize the requests and include fictitious names that are either typically Norwegian or foreign sounding. The results show whether discrimination exists. In contrast to many other settings, like labor or housing market, it should be relatively easy to reduce discrimination if it exists."
