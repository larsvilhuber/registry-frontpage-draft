abstract: "Fatherhood TIES is testing several interventions within federally funded fatherhood programs with the goal of improving fathers’ economic stability, parenting, co-parenting, and relationship quality.  The interventions include: (1) one-on-one coaching focused on improving parenting, (2) individualized, concierge-level supports for navigating various systems that affect fathers’ ability to spend time with their children, such as family court, child welfare, and child support; and (3) financial supports and financial coaching. In general, the interventions are intended to affect parenting behavior, father-child relationships, co-parenting relationships, economic stability, and father well-being. For the first two interventions, fathers are being randomly assigned to the intervention or business-as-usual. The third test is based on a factorial design, in which cohorts of fathers enrolled at the same time are being assigned to receive a financial payment or not, and within each group individual fathers are being randomly assigned to receive financial coaching or not. The study will include 2,060 fathers, of which 480 will be enrolled in the parenting coaching study, 600 will be enrolled in the systems navigation study, and 980 will be enrolled in the financial supports study.
