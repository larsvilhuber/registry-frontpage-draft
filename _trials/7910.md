abstract: "The traditional TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training) sector in Pakistan has a variety of different training programs. However, many graduates do not find long-term employment. One major reason for this seems to be an imbalance between the jobs and skills in demand on the labor market and the programs offered by the training institutions. Within this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of a demand-led TVET program in Badin and Kashmore in adapting learnersâ€™ employment expectations and increasing the likelihood of long-term employment. The program was designed based on a market needs assessment and as such answers the need of more market-oriented training programs. This makes it a promising alternative to traditional programs, which is likely to generate better employment outcomes at a similar cost."
