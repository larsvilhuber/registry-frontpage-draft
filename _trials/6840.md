abstract: "We examine the impact of financial difficulty to decision making quality via a large survey to a representative sample of Dutch population. We use the COVID-19 crisis as a natural intervention, since it creates financial difficulty to many households. Decision making quality is measured by violations of Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preferences (GARP), and we assess households’ decision-making quality two times: during and after the COVID-19 crisis. Following cognitive depletion literature, we additionally elicit participants’ cognitive performance. To further examine the source of violations of GARP, we investigate the existence of a well-defined utility function. We discuss policy implications of our results both in the short term and in the long term."
