abstract: "In an influential paper, Agranov and Ortoleva (JPE, 2017), like others, find that "a large majority of [experimental] subjects exhibit stochastic choice" when facing an identical (lottery) choice multiple times. Their paper aims to discriminate between competing accounts of stochastic choice. We seek to develop this agenda by replicating their original findings in an online experiment while investigating primarily the role of preference imprecision in explaining stochastic choices."
