abstract: "In Ghanaâ€™s Northern Region, smallholder farmers cultivate rainfed crops, face significant risk of weather shocks, chronically underinvest in input technologies, achieve just a fraction of potential yields, maintain limited liquid savings and may be food insecure. Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), the Savannah Agricultural Research Institute (SARI), and the Ghana Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA) will examine the barriers to smallholder farmer adoption of intensified cultivation practices and risk management tools. IPA will further measure the impact of three innovative, potentially scalable programs on farm production and profitability, consumption and food security, intra-household labor allocation, asset holdings and rural household resilience. The Disseminating Innovative Resources and Technologies to Smallholders (DIRTS) project will use the randomized controlled trial methodology to measure the impact of providing assured rural access to (1) improved information flows through Android-based extension applications with community extension agents, (2) increased access to improved-yield agro-input packages, and (3) commercial drought index insurance. The baseline survey for DIRTS will be completed in May 2014 covering 3,240 households in 162 communities. Communities, and households within communities, will be randomized into one of four treatment groups: insurance and extension; insurance and agricultural inputs; insurance, extension, and agricultural inputs, and insurance only. Two main evaluation tools will be used to study DIRTS households: comprehensive annual surveys to collect household and plot level data (from year 1), and weekly tracking of household labor surveys during the agricultural season (from year 2)."
