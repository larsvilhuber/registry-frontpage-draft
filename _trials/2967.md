abstract: "In Chicago, many homicides stem from altercations that spiral out of control. How can we help youth avoid the kinds of automatic behavior that can be dangerous or deadly in high-crime urban neighborhoods? In this study, we worked to test whether text messages encouraging youth to slow down and think can help them and make safer decisions, particularly in high-stakes moments."
