abstract: "Buying consumer goods on deferred payment, or on store credit, is one of the most common credit instruments in large parts of the developing world. While store credit could increase businesses’ market access by expanding reach to liquidity-constrained customers, its availability might be limited due to the costs of learning customer type and risk. In this paper, we investigate the tradeoffs of such informal buy now pay later credit within a network of informal groceries in a low-income Indian settlement. To do so, we will randomize customers to receive store credit, a price discount, or a business-as-usual control. We aim to test the assignment’s implications on customer repayment, future purchases, loyalty, and overall business operations and profits. In a smaller experiment, we will test whether the offer of credit or discounts drives customers to increase their search radius and deviate from existing relationships with store owners. Finally, we will also test whether store-owners expand the number and type of customers they lend to following experimentation through insured lending from the intervention.
