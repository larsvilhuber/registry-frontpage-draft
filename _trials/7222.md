abstract: "The transfer pathway from community colleges to four-year institutions is critical to increasing bachelor’s degree completion rates and reducing graduation disparities by race and income.  However, many students who intend to transfer from a community college to a four-year institution do not successfully follow through on these intentions: while 80 percent of community colleges students indicate they intend to transfer, fewer than 25 do so (Horn & Skomsvold, 2011; Shapiro et al., 2015).  A major challenge to successful transfer is the difficulty of choosing community college courses that fulfill the complex set of requirements that students face on their path to a bachelor’s degree.  To increase the transfer and degree attainment rates among community college students, we will test a pilot program to provide students with personalized course recommendations through an intrusive advising intervention.  Specifically, we have developed a course recommendation algorithm that uses a student’s prior academic history to generate course recommendations that will (1) maximize the students academic future academic performance; (2) maximize the number of credits that will transfer to the student’s intended four-year institution; and (3) will minimize the time to bachelor’s degree, by giving preference to courses that satisfy requirements at both the community college and the student’s intended four-year institution.  These recommendations will be delivered during one-on-one advising meetings that will take place shortly before the course registration period for the upcoming term; students will also receive supplemental outreach via text and email to emphasize the key points discussed during these meetings.  We will implement and evaluate this pilot program through a randomized controlled trial, with randomization and data collection occurring at the student-level.  We will launch this pilot program at one of Virginia’s community colleges during the Spring 2021 and Fall 2021 terms."
