abstract: "Pakistan continues to face low participation by women in the labour market despite active involvement by the government to introduce policies encouraging women to work. This study looks specifically at male workers who have at least three years experience working in the production process in garment factories in different parts of Punjab (Pakistan) to determine workers willingness to comply with the social norm of strict physical separation of the sexes. This paper contributes to the literature on the willingness of workers to comply with existing social norms and its impact on participation in the labour market. Understanding the extent to which gender norms can be overcome by economic incentives can help policymakers in developing more nuanced policies in attracting workers to participate in the labour market.
