abstract: "This study investigates the effect of factual information on public support and beliefs regarding the EU's Fit-for-55 climate policy, leveraging representative samples from France and Italy. Prior to information administration, subjects' pre-existing attitudes and beliefs about the climate policy, both incorporating and excluding the carbon dividend, will be assessed. The intervention phase then presents scientific evidence on the expected effects of the Fit-for-55 package to two distinct groups. One group is informed about the policy outcomes excluding the carbon dividend, while the second group considers the policy, including the carbon dividend's implications. The research aims to analyze shifts in support for the climate policy and modifications in beliefs regarding its impact on emissions, the macro economy, and household finances, both before and after exposure to the evidence. By employing representative samples from France and Italy, the study provides insights into the role of informed knowledge in shaping public perceptions and support for complex environmental policies."
