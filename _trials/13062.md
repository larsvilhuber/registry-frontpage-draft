abstract: "Pay and work hours fluctuate from month to month in many jobs. A particular case -- growing in popularity over time -- is gig jobs on online platforms. Variation in job outcomes is not a problem as long as workers can, on average, understand and predict them accurately. As a result of limited attention or cognitive capacity, or a desire for self-deception, workers may persistently hold inaccurate beliefs that lead to inefficient labor supply decisions. I will conduct an experimental randomized information treatment to try to make these errors less of a concern. I will measure effects over time on both beliefs and labor market decisions."
