abstract: "This study examines the effects of parental training on early childhood stimulation on parent-child interactions, maternal depression and child’s nutritional and cognitive outcomes in Guatemala. This study assesses the cost effectiveness of using home-visits or group-sessions.  More than 40 percent of Guatemala’s population is indigenous, making the country an ideal setting for new comparative research of an at-risk population that has not been studied comprehensively. Additionally, the literature on cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis of early childhood stimulation programs is limited. While more common in the developed world, this type of analysis is most needed in the developing world given the limited resources and the need to assess programs’ feasibility,sustainability, and scalability. To our knowledge, this study is the first that used a clustered randomized controlled trial to assign communities (n=111) to three treatment arms: home visitations, group sessions, and no intervention in an indigenous setting. As such, it will advance the literature by providing evidence as to whether one early childhood stimulation modality produces better outcomes than the other does and, if so, by how much and at what cost. About 2,000 children between 6 and 18 months of age were assessed at baseline. The interventions were also complemented with training, supervision, and mentoring of mother educators. "
