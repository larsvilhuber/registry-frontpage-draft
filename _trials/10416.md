abstract: "We are studying how the structure of information presented to human decision-makers affects their performance and bias in a prediction task.

Specifically, study subjects predict the performance on math tasks of multiple test-takers from a previous experiment. For each test-taker, the study subjects see (i) test-taker characteristics (age, gender, education) as well as (ii) assistance in the form of an average of the performance of other test-takers with similar characteristics.

The main intervention is variation in the information by which the performance of previous test-takers is averaged. In the treatment conditions, averages are formed separately by gender. In the control conditions, averages are taken jointly across genders.

The main outcome of interest is the average difference in assessments of women relative to men. We hypothesize that supplying averages that vary by gender increase the predictions of women’s performance relative to predictions of men’s performance.

Study subjects are US adults recruited through Prolific. We will report summary statistics of age, gender, and education characteristics with our data analysis.

Conditions are assigned randomly at the subject level. There are three treatment conditions and three corresponding control conditions. The total target sample size is 1250."
