abstract: "Climate change will in coming decades lead to increased frequency and severity of floods, drought and extreme weather events. As the more exposed areas of the world become increasingly inhospitable, this will lead to substantial climate induced displacement of people in developing countries. We conduct an experiment in Bangladesh which analyses key factors that may shape attitudes towards the environmentally displaced. The aim is to understand how attitudes towards migrants form and evolve, and how they can be influenced to ease resettlement processes and avert tension."
