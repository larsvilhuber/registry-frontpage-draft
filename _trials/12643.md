abstract: "To balance peak and off-peak passenger flows and enhance travelers' riding experience, this experiment plan aims to innovate demand management methods, starting from the demand side, using price incentive policies to induce travelers to use the subway during off-peak hours. Achieving success in changing daily habitual behaviour often requires persistent effort. Incekara-Hafalir et al (2023) highlight the importance of self-selection in incentivising persistent effort. Further, this study will examine the mechanism of self-selection. We mainly plan to study the effectiveness of 2 kinds of mechanisms, one-time self-selection between all-or-nothing and piece-rate, and multiple-time self-selection, to incentivize change of repeated daily travel behaviours over time."
