abstract: "Everywhere in the world, teenagers are asked to make educational choices which will have long-term consequences on their career trajectories and opportunities. Across OECD countries, students between 10 and 14 years old are asked to choose what school track to follow. While this choice is influenced by a number of people, tools which empower students to make a more informed choice are uncommon. 
This study aims to understand how experimentation affects job search and career choices. We hypothesize that encouraging teenagers’ experimentation of different occupations will affect their job search and ultimately help them make better choices for their career. To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first study to examine how (forced) experimentation in a real-life work environment can affect students’ job search and, perhaps, their long-term career choices.
We design a randomized controlled trial (RCT) targeted to grade 8 students in Switzerland, of whom most will start an apprenticeship after compulsory education (i.e., after 9th grade). The intervention consists in enabling students to experience the real work environment in occupations they have not considered before. We collaborate with schools and firms. The intervention is part of a one-day school event where students visit 4-5 local firms to hear and learn about apprenticeships they have signed up for. For the project, we will introduce experimental variation in the type of occupations that a student experiences during these visits at the local firms."
