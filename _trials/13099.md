abstract: "Governments and utilities are searching for innovative ways of promoting water conservation. In this paper, we present the results from a natural field experiment (n = 17,498) that tests whether encouraging consumers to commit to conservation goals reduces their water consumption. Some consumers were asked to set their own goals, while others were either asked to commit to a reduction of 5%, 10%, 15%, or 20%. Further, some consumers were told that their commitment, and their performance, would be made public to other participants. "
