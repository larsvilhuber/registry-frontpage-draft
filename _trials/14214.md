abstract: "We will run a large-scale RCT that randomizes discounts to households' water bills in a large US city.  The goal consists of learning about factors affecting propensity to pay. We will then design a personalized pricing algorithm to jointly address the problem of reducing payment delinquency rates for disadvantaged households while improving municipal revenues collected on water bills."
