abstract: "In recent years, economists have been increasingly interested in identifying how religion mediates economic development. Individualsâ€™ religious beliefs shape their worldview and thereby interplays with many economic outcomes, from basic consumption to entrepreneurship to how people respond to policies. Thus, understanding whether or how different beliefs shape economic behavior is instrumental for policy makers and researchers to foster economic development. This question is particularly pertinent for economic development in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the growth of Pentecostal and Charismatic churches mark a major shift in the religious landscape. Pentecostalism is thought to instill greater aspirations, hope, and trust in individuals, all factors that economists have identified as key contributors to development.  However, the direction of causality is not clear:  Are those with greater aspirations and trust more likely to join a Pentecostal church? Or does belonging to a Pentecostal church and hearing its messages preached make one more aspirational? 

In this project, we plan to test whether exposure to different religious messaging influences economic decision making. To do so, we will use a randomized control trial to measure the effects on behavior from an intervention that randomizes exposure to different religious messages. 1400 individuals living in informal settlements in Kisumu, Kenya will be randomly divided into a control group and two treatment arms. Those in each treatment will be invited to participate in two-day long workshops, in which one treatment is managed by Pentecostal preachers, and the other by a mainline Christian group (i.e., Anglican/Catholic). Following the workshop, a survey and experimental game in which participants allocate funds given to them from project staff will measure differences in behavior related to entrepreneurship, trust, and generosity resulting from the intervention. Our hypothesis is that those assigned to the Pentecostal workshop will exhibit more entrepreneurial and charitable behavior than those in the control group, consistent with a higher level of aspirations and trust.
