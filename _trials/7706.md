abstract: "We replicate Experiment 2 in Dertwinkel-Kalt and Köster, "Salience and Skewness Preferences", Journal of the European Economic Association 18(5), 2020, 2057-2107, using a different subject pool. We implement an additional treatment from Loewenfeld and Zheng (2021) that allows us to control for so-called event-splitting effects."
