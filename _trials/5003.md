abstract: "In a laboratory experiment, we examine how introducing a gain and loss contract affects the productivity of high and low performing agents. In the experiment, participants first perform a real-effort task under a fixed wage. The stage is used to measure participantsâ€™ baseline performance. In a second stage, participants work on the same real-effort task, but the payment scheme varies across treatments. They now either work under a positively framed gain contract or a negatively framed loss contract. The incentive contracts are payoff equivalent and only differ in terms of framing. "
