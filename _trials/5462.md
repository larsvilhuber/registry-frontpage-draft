abstract: "We examine the role of third-order beliefs in shaping potentially stigmatized public behavior. We hypothesize that information, in addition to its persuasive effects, potentially also affects behavior by providing an "excuse" for engaging in xenophobic actions, leading to changes in equilibrium expression even among people who do not necessarily believe the information. The central implication of our theoretical framework is that people make different inferences about agents who engage in xenophobic actions when they know those agents have an "excuse" for doing so, relative to when they believe those agents do not have an "excuse". In particular, our framework predicts that when making inferences about agents with an excuse, respondents will believe these agents to be less biased than agents without an excuse. We test this prediction with an incentivized experiment eliciting respondents' beliefs about the characteristics of agents who chose to donate to an anti-immigrant organization with or without an excuse."
