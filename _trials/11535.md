abstract: "Although economic agents are assumed to behave in a rational way, one classic criticism is that they generally lack computational skills to achieve the optimal outcome. We propose an experiment in which subjects are endowed with a budget and have to decide the amount of goods (there are two goods) that they would like to buy taking into account their prices and the available budget (prices and the budget change from one round to another). In that setting, we also propose tools (one nudge and two boosts) to help subjects better achieve the optimal outcome. While the effects of nudges are now well recognized in the economic literature, one criticism is that they generally rely on the exploitation of agents’ cognitive biases, leading to manipulation. As a solution, boosts have been proposed as a ‘remedy’, in the sense that they rely on the learning of a new competence. However, few studies have sought to investigate the potential of boosts as a substitute to nudges. The experiment includes a control group and three treatment groups: one nudge, the default option, and two different boosts, one based on the provision of computational tools and the other based on providing insight into the problem (see details later in this trial information). We first aim to assess the extent to which the nudge and the boosts are effective in improving subjects’ decisions. Second, we compare the durability of the effects of these instruments. We do this by observing subjects’ decisions once these tools are no longer implemented. 

Our main expectations are: i) subjects’ payoffs increase when they are treated with the nudge or the boosts; and ii) the durability of the effects of boosts are larger than those of the nudge we consider, if there is some, since boosts rely on the learning of a competence."
