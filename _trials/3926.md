abstract: "We conducted a randomized controlled trial among 1,660 women from 80 villages in northeastern Nigeria. Respondents were randomly assigned to view one of the two flipcharts: 2) control flipcharts, which contained written explanation about the severity of the disease, or 1) `scared-straight' flipcharts that contain the salient information about the disease severity in addition to the written explanation about the severity of the disease. Additionally, respondents were provided randomly assigned amounts of cash incentives: 5 naira (3.3 US. cents), 300 naira (2 US. dollars), or 800 naira (5.3 US. dollars)."
