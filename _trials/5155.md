abstract: "We will conduct a large-scale randomized field experiment at the University of Szeged that takes the form of a message of encouragement. All students at the university will receive before their exam. We will randomize when students receive the message. A randomly selected half of all students will receive the message of encouragement before their first exam, and will not receive it before their second exam. The other random half of the sample will be treated before their second exam, and will not be treated before their first exam. By comparing students who receive the message of encouragement with those who do not, we will investigate how the message of encouragement influences students’ grades on the exam. We will explore treatment heterogeneity and test for the particular mechanism through which the potential effect might operate. Our research has particular policy relevance in terms of its search for low-cost, easily scalable interventions that can prevent students from dropping out."
