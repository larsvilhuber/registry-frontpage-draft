abstract: "We study the recent rapid expansion of Bihar's social audits initiative as a measure to improve access and delivery of social protection under India's national workfare scheme. We undertake a causal evaluation utilizing administrative data from a randomized controlled trial across the state. Initial analysis using the administrative data finds that audits lead to a significant, sustained reduction in work as reported in administrative data, a result that could reflect some combination of reduced corruption --- a goal of audits, or declines in actual work --- an unintended consequence. Looking ahead, we will collect additional survey data needed to differentiate between these possibilities and provide further direction for program improvement."
