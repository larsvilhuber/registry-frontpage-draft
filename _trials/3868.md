abstract: "Reducing the consumption of animal products is an increasingly recognized public policy objective. With its health, environmental and ethical stakes, the transition to plant-based diets is now emerging as a major challenge for the public authorities. The means implemented to promote this transition have in recent years been mainly the work of associations towards consumers and producers, which is sometimes referred to as private politics. The work of raising awareness on these issues has mainly been led by two types of associations: associations adopting a reformist / welfarist discourse, ie, which aims to improve farming conditions and reduce meat consumption, and associations adopting an abolitionist discourse, ie, aimed at stopping the exploitation of animals and, thus, at the end of meat consumption. The effectiveness of these two types of speech is central to understanding how to achieve a significant decrease in meat consumption. Thus, we propose to measure experimentally the impact of welfarist and abolitionist discourses in the laboratory."
