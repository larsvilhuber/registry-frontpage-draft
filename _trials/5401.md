abstract: "In recent years, Mongolia has experienced significant growth in the total fertility rate. The demand for childcare facilities has increased dramatically in Ulaanbaatar. Because of the excess demand for public childcare services, a public lottery has been used as an effective and fair means of allocating available slots since 2016. In this study, we evaluate the impact of the universally free public childcare program using a natural experiment framework. We will conduct a baseline survey and two follow up surveys to examine short and medium-term impacts. We focus on three outcomes of interest for employment: employment, earnings, and job quality. We also want to investigate the effects of the program on children's health and development."
