abstract: "Small businesses that seek and obtain strategic business advice are more likely to thrive
and grow. Taking business advice can increase productivity, drive sales and improve the
chance of survival in tough economic times.

Yet as many as three in every ten small businesses in the UK may have an unmet need
for business advice. To date, available evidence is associative, and does not establish a
causal link between small businesses taking business advice and their subsequent higher
growth. No one definitely knows whether it is the advice conferred that enables businesses
to be more likely to prosper, or whether advice and growth are two separate and unrelated
consequences of some other unobserved characteristic or behaviour. This is what Growth
Vouchers will test.

The Growth Vouchers programme is a pioneering government research project that aims
to make it easier for small businesses to access expert advice to help them grow and test
which types of business advice are most effective.

The Growth Vouchers programme will run until March 2015 to attract around 20,000 small
businesses that do not normally use advice. Vouchers worth up to £2,000 each will be
given to a majority of the small businesses who take part to help them pay for advice.
This programme will operate as a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT), which will enable
the government to obtain a robust assessment of the impact of different types of advice on
participating businesses to be obtained. RCTs are widely regarded as the ‘gold standard’
for empirical research and are used extensively in medicine and international
development. This is the first time that an RCT has been run on such scale anywhere in
the world to explore what business advice works best.

The Growth Vouchers programme will produce real and comprehensive evidence, while
providing benefits for the businesses who take part. This evidence will be used to inform
future policy.

This document sets out how the Growth Vouchers programme will operate, how its design
satisfies the principles of running an RCT and the key questions that we aim to answer. It
then explains what data and analysis will be done to arrive at an answer and the technical
constraints on how robust our answers may be.
