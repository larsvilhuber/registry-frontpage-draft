abstract: "In decision theory, people may behave differently when faced with unknown risks compared to known risks. We call unknown risks "ambiguity". One possibility is that a person may be averse to ambiguity and, therefore, prefer to face a known risk, all else equal. A famous experiment proposed by Ellsberg in 1961 provides a concrete experiment in which many people indeed choose a known risk over an unknown risk. In fact, this behavior is not consistent with traditional models of decision making and has motivated a literature that captures such "ambiguity averse" behavior. Our experiments are designed to test (i) to what extent this behavior can be interpreted as aversion to ambiguity in experiments closely related to Ellsberg's experiments, and (ii) to what extent people might behave differently when we describe how and why to avoid the unknown risk through a "hedging" process that involves basing their choice on the outcome of a coin flip.
