abstract: "While a persistent enrollment gap in German early child care by socioeconomic status (SES) is well-documented, the reasons for lower enrollment rates among lower SES children are poorly understood. Focusing on the supply-side of child care markets, we plan to investigate whether admission decisions by child care center managers differ by parental SES. To this end, we will send out a standardized email to child care center managers, drafted to mimic real parental requests. The email includes implicit signals about parents’ SES that we randomly vary across emails. By analyzing differences in response rates, response time, and quality of replies by parental SES signal, we examine to what extent child care center managers discriminate when responding to email inquiries.
