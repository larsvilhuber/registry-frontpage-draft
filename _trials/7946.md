abstract: "The aim of this project is to merge data collected by a survey designed by the research team with administrative data. The survey measures perceptions and knowledge of the citizens of l’Ametlla del Vallès, a medium-sized town in Catalonia, in terms of local tax burden, social position and local public expenditures. The administrative records contain their tax contribution to the municipality, which allows us to compare the perceived and actual tax burden.

People generally do not know their tax burden on the local level. As a first step, this project will document the misperception of citizens regarding their own tax payments. We also ask participants about their contribution relative to the other tax payers in the town. We document study the deviation between the perceived position in the local tax contribution scale by the citizens with their real contribution to the local finances.

We than provide treated participants an information treatment about the mean tax payments and costs of different public goods. We study the possible changes on the views towards the municipal services and the willingness to increase or decrease their local contribution when citizens are shown the average tax burden to fund them and their total cost.

Several other socio-economic variables will be measured during the survey or taken from administrative records. Perceived social position, feeling of belonging to the municipality and basic information such as education, employment or household characteristics will be considered. 

As a third outcome, we will also analyze the differences in views towards redistribution and empathy of the citizens depending on the proximity of the target group to be benefited.
