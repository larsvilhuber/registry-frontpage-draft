abstract: "The primary objective is to determine whether strengthening a farmer's perceptions of the security of land tenure makes her more likely to make short-term and long-term investments in her land. The overarching policy question of interest is: “How do changes in property rights that strengthen a farmer’s perception of long term security over farmland affect a farmer’s decision to make investments---in particular, a long-term investment like agroforestry---on their own farms?” The evaluation breaks this into two key research questions for hypothesis testing. First, does the intervention strengthen farmer's perception of tenure security? And assuming it does, does it make the farmer more willing to make investments?
