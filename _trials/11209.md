abstract: "Background: The worldwide burden of Hypertension (HTN) is increasing due to an aging population predicted to affect one-third of the world's population by 2025. In Indonesia, the highest percentage of HTN was among the 65-74 age group (63.2%). Furthermore, uncontrolled HTN led to a primary risk factor for stroke, heart disease, and kidney failure. Among older people, the additional increased risk was vascular dementia and Alzheimer's Disease . Our recent scoping review found that there was variability among people in self-care management, indicating that each hypertensive subject had a specific and personalized challenge in practicing HTN self-care. Health coaching may be a method to solve this gap. 
Aim: To determine the efficacy and sustainable impact of an Indonesian adaptation of an 8-week nurse health coaching intervention on self-care management and self-efficacy in older people with HTN.
Methods: This is a randomized 2X3 repeated measure experimental design. We plan to recruit 140 older people with HTN living in Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia, aged 60 years old and above, having been diagnosed with hypertension by a medical doctor, taking antihypertensive medication, and medically stable. Data measurement will be taken thrice: baseline, 1 week after health coaching intervention and 3 months follow-up after no intervention. During 8th week coaching intervention, researcher and participants will identify the priority goals and small-step plans, discuss barriers and facilitators for achieving the action steps, improve self-care skills and provide supportive coaching to achieving participants goals.

Discussion: Managing HTN self-care in Indonesia and other South East Asian countries might differ from the Western area due to different cultures, lifestyles, and geographical backgrounds. This study will be the first study to include motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral approach and to test the sustainability of the health coaching program's impact after three months of no intervention with Indonesian backgrounds.
