abstract: "We implement a field experiment to measure discrimination against LGTBI, women, and migrants in the real state market in urban Ecuador. We hired real estate agents to evaluate online ten pairs of observationally equivalent fictitious candidates for home rentals. The candidates only differ in that one of them comes from one of those minority groups. To measure discrimination we count on three outcomes based on differences in how the real state agents treat the minority vs. the non-minority applicants in the experiment, namely: 1) the rate at which they prefer a minority applicant from a nonminority one; 2) their rating of the "fit" of each applicant for the property, and; 3)  what the agents suggest candidates should pay for their rentals. We study heterogeneity in the estimates of discrimination across characteristics of the recruiters (age, gender, experience, education, cognitive and noncognitive skills) and the applicants (family composition, age, gender). We decompose the estimates of discrimination to disentangle statistical from taste-based discrimination. We endowed the experiment with a behavioral intervention that showed the real state agents a "vignette' in the form of a pop-up message. The message told the recruiters that minorities have to overcome disadvantages to perform similarly to non-minorities. We study the effects of that behavioral intervention on the three outcomes across the three minority conditions mentioned above.    "
