abstract: "Many overindebted individuals are subject to debt enforcement without any possibility of ever repaying their debts. Debt relief, which in Sweden is a five-year program, is realistically their only chance out of overindebtedness. However, many do not apply for debt relief. This study aims to investigate both how overindebted individuals may be motivated to apply for debt relief and what the individual consequences of debt relief are. For the former question we relate to the literature on how targeted information may affect take-up for various means-tested social benefits. For the latter question, previous research has mainly studied correlations in observational data and, e.g., found that while overindebtness correlates with bad outcomes (e.g., physical and mental illness), it is not clear that the Swedish debt relief program solves any of these problems. We contribute with causal evidence by taking advantage of a randomized intervention at the Swedish Enforcement Agency. This intervention targets information about debt relief towards overindebted individuals. We employ register data to investigate take-up of debt relief for the treated individuals compared to the non-treated individuals in the control group. We also examine the impact on labor market and health outcomes.  These results are intended to inform policy discussions about the design of the debt relief program in the Swedish context and across other similar welfare regimes and regulatory environments.
