abstract: "In different strategic environments, senders might want to use distinct communication strategies to persuade multiple interacting receivers. I test whether the optimal communication strategy involves private (public) signals when the strategic environment of the receivers features strategic substitutes (complements). This prediction arises in information design (Bergemann & Morris, 2019), and can guide i.e. governmental information release. I propose to measure responses to different exogenous structures, focusing on receiversâ€™ interaction."
