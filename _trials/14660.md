abstract: "Trust and trustworthiness are integral components of cooperation: a behaviour which drives economic growth and prosperity. However, the levels of such vary dramatically across the world. Drivers of trust heterogeneity include institutions, socioeconomics and cultural norms. In this experiment, I investigate intra- and inter-cultural trust levels across the so-called North-South divide in England using a risk-adjusted trust game. The setting is of high policy relevance due to the national governmentâ€™s increasing focus and investment in spreading economic opportunity across the country. In reproducing results from the World Value Survey, I aim to decompose the trust differential into socioeconomic factors and belief asymmetries across the divide. I then study how specific trust differs across individuals above and below the divide. Following this I test the efficacy of a collaborative intervention in bridging the gap in trust."
