abstract: "In early 2018, Chile enacted a new regulation on the labor inclusion of people with disabilities, in the form of law 21,015. This law dictates that all public firms and institutions with more than 100 employees must reserve 1% of its positions for people with disabilities. Taking this into account, the Chilean scenario presents a far more promising context for firm compliance than other countries in the region where quotas are set at 4% or 5%. This paper examines whether firm compliance to the newly established quota can be nudged through messages embodied with behavioral insights. The experiment includes designing the letters, randomizing the firms, sending the letters and monitoring the implementation."
