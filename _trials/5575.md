abstract: "We will perform a survey experiment to measure how government declarations and actions affect mental states and social preferences.  To manipulate the (true) information that participants receive, we will randomize exposure to news about government declarations and actions. We will then analyze how the nature of this information affects mental states, social preferences, and behavior. "
