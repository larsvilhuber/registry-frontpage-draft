abstract: "Ensuring universal access to electricity is essential for global development. In the health sector, lack of reliable light and electricity is a major challenge for health workers when conducting deliveries at night. However, there is very little evidence of the impact of improving access to reliable electrification at maternity facilities on the quality of maternity care they provide. This stepped wedge cluster-randomized trial will evaluate the impact of a reliable light and electricity source - the "Solar Suitcase" - on outcomes of availability and brightness of light, the quality of maternal care provided, and health worker satisfaction. The study will take place in rural health facilities conducting deliveries in Uganda that lack access to reliable light and electricity. Data collection will include direct observation of deliveries during daytime and nighttime hours, as well as interviews with facility staff. "
