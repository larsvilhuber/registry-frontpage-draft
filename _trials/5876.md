abstract: "The effectiveness of Covid19 mitigation measures such as handwashing and social distancing depends critically on compliance by young adults. The reason is that young adults are far less likely than older adults to suffer severe complications from infection but are far more likely to be infected, i.e., to be carriers. In Latin America, this incentive problem is magnified by the fact that young adults comprise a larger share of the population than in industrialized countries. This randomized controlled trial examines young adult compliance in Bogotá, Colombia. We test whether providing information on Covid19, and the framing of that information, affects young adults’ compliance with and attitudes towards mitigation recommendations and mandates. As for framing, we test the effects of messages that emphasize the public benefits of compliance (protect the community), the private benefits (protect yourself), and both types of benefits."
