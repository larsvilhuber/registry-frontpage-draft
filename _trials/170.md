abstract: "The vast majority of new HIV infections occur in sub-Saharan Africa, where nearly 2 million people become infected with HIV/AIDS every year. Forty-five percent of these new HIV infections occur among people under 25 years old, and nearly all of them are due to unprotected sex. Ensuring the adoption of safer sexual behavior among youth is critical to keeping the new generations free of HIV.

This research study aims to examine, through a large randomized controlled trial, the impact of two HIV prevention strategies among a youth population in Kenya: Voluntary Counseling and Testing for HIV (VCT), and condom distribution.
