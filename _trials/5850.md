abstract: "Using an online survey, we study how householdsâ€™ exposure to health risks and economic risks associated with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic affects the type of news articles they choose to read (optimistic or pessimistic), and the extent to which the content of the news articles affects their beliefs about the consequences of the pandemic and about the appropriate policy response."
