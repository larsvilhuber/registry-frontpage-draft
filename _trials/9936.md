abstract: "Sequential consumption of experiential products gives rise to inter-temporal associations that influence the utility derived from the focal product. Developing recommendation algorithms that design experiences tailored to the users' dynamic preferences can be effective in enhancing user engagement. Using music streaming as the paradigmatic context of such interactions, where the user consumes multiple products in multiple sessions, in our paper, we construct a utility-based theoretical framework that takes into account the past consumption of users leading to references. The heterogenous responses of the users, rooted in the well-established constructs of habit formation and variety seeking, help us understand their dynamic preferences in sequential consumption, which are further influenced by the memory decay effects. This novel way of tracking the preferences of listeners allows us to develop a new class of recommendation algorithms that seeks to learn the variability in successively consumed music preferable to every listener in addition to the kind of music she likes (i.e., the genre or artist), which is different than the status quo of recommendation algorithms in the music streaming industry that focuses only on the latter (collaborative filtering-based). The counterfactual analyses that we carry out in the paper suggests that the recommendation algorithm that we propose is far better at retaining the listeners on the platform by increasing their engagement and the average duration per song that they listen to. The goal of this experiment is to test this effect in a controlled environment through randomly assigned interventions that correspond to the kind of recommendation provided to the participant. The experiment study is divided in two sessions where the first one allows us to learn the music listening preferences of the participants by recording their real-time reaction to the music. They are then randomly classified into one of the two treatment groups or a control group for the second session where Treatment Group 1 is provided recommendations based on the algorithm that we propose in our paper, Treatment Group 2 is provided recommendations based on the collaborative filtering-based algorithm, and Control group participants are provided with a randomly selected playlist of songs, The response of the participants in both the sessions is tracked through their skipping activity and the self-reported satisfaction metric. Empirical analyses are then to be carried out on this data to statistically measure the effect of recommendations based on our proposed method on the listener engagement and satisfaction in comparison to the other intervention and control group."
