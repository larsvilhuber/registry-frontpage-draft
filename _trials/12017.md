abstract: "Our first-order interest lies in understanding the current attitudes of economists toward their own field’s standards and practices concerning the disclosure of conflicts of interest. To that end, we intend to conduct a survey of economists about these standards and present them with hypothetical scenarios of potentially inadequate disclosure. Additionally, we intend to compare these norms against norms and beliefs about adequate disclosure practices held by journalists and the general population.
We intend to use the responses of the survey described below to answer a number of questions about economists’ perceived practices and norms. Such questions include, but are not limited to, the following:

• Do economists believe that they, personally, adequately disclose their potential conflicts of interest?
• Do economists believe that their colleagues (i.e. the field as a whole) adequately disclose potential conflicts of interest?
• Do economists believe that certain kinds of relationships present greater potential for a conflict of interest than others?
• How do these beliefs (systematically) vary with individuals’ personal characteristics (past consulting affiliations, tenure-status, gender, nationality)?
• Do economists believe that existing policies impose a net cost or provide a benefit to the profession?
• Do economists’ beliefs on these issues diverge from those held by other groups?"
