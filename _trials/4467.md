abstract: "Using text messages to motivate, inform, and remind individuals at key moments has shown to be a promising research area. BIT’s previous research in the area of education has demonstrated how a nudge to someone in a students’ support network can help improve educational outcomes for the student. In one study, 1,500 students in the UK were asked to nominate a “study supporter” - somebody whom they knew and who cared about their learning, such as a parent, grandparent, sibling or other family member, or friend. 

These ‘Study Supporters’ were then texted weekly prompts to encourage the student who nominated them. The texts contained planning tips, upcoming deadlines, course content, academic resources and exam dates. These messages were designed to leverage existing social support networks that the students had but which were not, at the time, being put to good use. At the end of the school year, students who received the “study supporter” intervention were 27% more likely to pass their exams and 11% more likely to attend class. 

This current trial is being conducted by the Behavioural Insights Team (BIT) as part of the Department of Social Service’s (DSS) Try Test Learn (TTL) Fund. DSS established the TTL fund in 2016. The purpose of the fund is to identify and help Australians who are at risk of long term welfare dependency, under the Australian Priority Investment Approach to Welfare. One of the groups identified were young students from disadvantaged backgrounds who are at risk of dropping out of their post-secondary studies. 

This study aims to test whether personalised text messages to students and their nominated study supporters improves academic engagement and outcomes among Western Sydney University students, especially students from disadvantaged backgrounds."
