abstract: "The REDLAB project is aimed at combating the digital gaps that affect people receiving the Minimum Living Income (IMV) and the Canary Islands Insertion Benefit (PCI) between 45 and 65 years of age with a low level of education, which hinder their employability and their daily lives, making it impossible or limiting their access to rights. We will measure the impact of providing a tablet with an internet connection and digital skills training on labor market outcomes, social inclusion, and wellbeing. The randomized control trial will allocate 3000 individuals who are currently enrolled with the IMV or the PCI into three groups: one receiving the tablet with internet connection (treatment group 1), one receiving the tablet with internet connection and digital training (treatment group 2), and a pure control group that wonâ€™t receive anything. We expect the treatment will help participants overcome barriers they face to apply for welfare programs, jobs, increasing their labor force participation and job retention, and improving their quality of life and social inclusion."
