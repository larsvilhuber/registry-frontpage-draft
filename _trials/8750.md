abstract: "This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of hybrid and online teaching through a large-scale randomized controlled experiment. A total of 725 students were randomly assigned to either the hybrid or online teaching mode where students assigned to the hybrid mode received face-to-face lectures and tutorials and those to the online mode received exactly the same live-streamed lessons on Zoom. Since all students had access to the recorded teaching videos, the face-to-face element was the only difference between the hybrid and online teaching modes. This experiment can help to identify the add-on value of face-to-face teaching in a hybrid mode over a purely online teaching mode. Results showed that the difference in learning outcomes between the two modes were statistically insignificant. Class size was found to be an effect modifier that students assigned to the hybrid mode had significantly higher final weighted and final exam scores if they had face-to-face lessons with 25 students or less. The Pass/Fail grading option was found to have significantly negative effect on course performance. Continuous assessment should be emphasized and contribute more toward the final grade so that students are encouraged to work hard throughout the entire semester."
