abstract: "I investigate whether informing the American public of not only the Supreme Court’s mere endorsement of a policy stance but also its reasoning changes the former’s political opinion. The significance of the project is to extend existing literature regarding the legitimacy-conferring function of the Court, namely, that the Court could potentially sway the public opinion in its way by adopting a certain policy position. Existing literature focuses on the effect the Court has on public opinion by simply ruling a certain way, but I focus on the effect of providing the American public also with information about why the Court ruled in this way according to its own majority opinion. I will employ an online survey experiment on Qualtrics.
