abstract: "Developed over 15 years ago, the Evidence-Based Literacy Instruction (EBLI) program aims to provide teachers with instructional strategies to improve reading accuracy, fluency and comprehension. Teachers receive a three-day in-person training prior to the start of the school year, and then periodic support throughout the year.  In summer 2014, 63 teachers in grades 2-5 in seven Michigan charter schools were randomly assigned within school-grade blocks to receive EBLI training or a business as usual control condition. Students were tracked during the 2014-15 school year, and student outcomes were measured using a standardized reading assessment called the Measures of Academic Progress (MAP), developed by the Northwest Evaluation Association (NWEA)."
