abstract: "Through our project, we will make a basic phone-based defined contribution account available to approximately 1,000 employees at a large Afghan firm. Building on insights from recent focus groups conducted in Kabul and an ongoing field experiment studying the impact of mobile salary payments, we will use a randomized control trial to determine how such a product can best be designed to encourage contributions, paying particular attention to the role of the “default option” in subsequent decisions. Through face-to-face and phone-based interviews, as well as administrative data collected from the company, we will measure the extent to which salary-linked defined contribution accounts can have a lasting impact on the financial decisions of participants. In Afghanistan, where only 3% of the population are banked but over 60% own a mobile phone, such products are badly needed. If successful in Afghanistan, this product could provide a scalable mechanism for banks and mobile phone operators to improve the financial capabilities of millions of potential clients in some of the world’s poorest and most fragile countries. Likewise, firms in these countries may benefit from reduced turnover and increased employee motivation, contributing to overall productivity improvements.
