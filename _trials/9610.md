abstract: "Research shows that evidence-based algorithms perform better than humans in predicting the future. Yet people give less weight to AI advice than they should. By exogenously variating personal experience with AI predictions, we explore how personal experience impacts weight on algorithm advice and how the level of expertise moderates this relationship. Our results will help design algorithms that are better adopted by human decision-makers, and mitigate the biases that experts hold on algorithms."
