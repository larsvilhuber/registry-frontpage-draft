abstract: "College students rely on a diverse set of information when making educational decisions. A highly uncharted area in the education literature is what information college students use to make course enrollment and field of study decisions. Our study aims to fill this gap by providing students course grade outcomes of previous courses taught at Texas A&M University in an easy to read graphical interface that allows comparison across classes. To study if students use previous course outcome information we implement a Randomized Control Trial (RCT). To measure the usage of our webpage, we introduce a brief survey asking for a student's Texas A&M email and major and measure the total visits to our webtool page. To examine the effects on academic outcomes we will also look at course tool and major selection in spring 2019 as outcomes. "
