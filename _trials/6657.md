abstract: "People’s preference to make their own decisions rather than being dominated by others is at the heart of liberal democracies. This aversion to dominance might be impeded by threats to their physical safety, which political actors may seek to exploit. We study this issue in the context of the 2020 United States presidential election, where fear of riots and urban crime has featured as a prominent election issue. We measure the extent to which individuals prefer not to be dominated using willingness to pay to avoid being “dominated,” or yielding control over some aspect of their lives to another party, via an experiment called the “Boss Game”. We examine whether people’s aversion to being dominated is weakened when they are exposed to political advertising that evokes fear. "
