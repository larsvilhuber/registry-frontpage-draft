abstract: "This study uses a survey experiment to determine the most effective messaging to persuade people to take up a future vaccine for COVID-19. Ending the pandemic necessitates enough vaccination to achieve herd immunity, but survey evidence suggest up to 50% of people are hesitant to vaccinate. The survey divides respondents into one control and four treatment groups. Each treatment group is exposed to a message emphasizing either the benefits of vaccination or the risks of avoiding vaccination, to the respondent personally or to society in general. The survey is administered by USC's Understanding America Survey to a nationally representative panel. The outcome measure of interest is differences in self-reported intention to vaccinate for the four treatment arms relative to control, using a means-comparison test with inference adjusted for the testing of four hypotheses."
