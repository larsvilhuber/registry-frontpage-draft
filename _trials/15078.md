abstract: "Climate variability poses significant economic risks to smallholder dairy farmers in low- and middle-income countries. Rainwater harvesting tanks can help farmers adapt, while biodigesters, which convert cattle dung into clean-burning biofuel, offer a solution to reduce methane emissionsâ€”a major contributor to climate change.

Previous research in Western Kenya shows strong demand for asset-collateralized loans (ACLs) to purchase water tanks, boosting household economic output (Jack et al., 2023). This study evaluates the impact of SMS marketing campaigns promoting ACLs for water tanks and biodigesters. Using administrative data from the Savings and Credit Cooperative Organization (SACCO) we partner with, we will assess loan uptake and examine dairy production impacts through cooperative records."
