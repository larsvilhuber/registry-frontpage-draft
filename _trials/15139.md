abstract: "The rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) is gradually changing the way human learn and work. Nowadays, with more developed AI Agent, many tedious workflows can be largely simplified into simple human language instruction. With strong AI Agents that both master domain specific knowledge and provide automatic implementation, users can directly deliver a complete outcome for a given task without having to spend time and effort in mastering relevant knowledge.

While automation could directly boost productivity towards time-consuming work, its performance towards creative work stays not that satisfactory. AI researchers have been dreaming of creating robots to complete all work such that human could have time to think, to write, to compose and to create; but till now, the indirect influence of AI Agent application towards human capital knowledge level and creativity level has not receive sufficient attention or discussion:

1. With the help of AI Agent, users are no longer forced to immediately master relevant knowledge to complete time-consuming tasks on hand. Will users’ long-term knowledge level therefore be negatively affected? Will there be any heterogeneity within the effect (such as users’ background relevance and study ability)?
2. With the help of AI Agent, users can greatly save time from the time-consuming tasks. How will users’ performance towards creative work be affected? How will AI Agent’s effect on users’ knowledge level intervene in the procedure? Is the application of AI Agent eventually a good thing for human capital creativity?

We generate the following hypotheses:

Hypothesis 1: After applying AI Agent, users tend to have long-term underperformance on relevant domain knowledge, with the results stronger for more specialized/professional AI Agent design;
Hypothesis 2: After applying AI Agent, users will perform better on creative work, ceteris paribus;
Hypothesis 3: Knowledge level will endogenously affect creativity level: after applying AI Agent, users’ increase in creative work performance will be partially offset by the decrease of domain knowledge level, with the results stronger for more specialized AI Agent design;
Hypothesis 4: All of above effects will be heterogeneous based on users’ knowledge background and learning capability."
