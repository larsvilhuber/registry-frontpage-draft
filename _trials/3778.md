abstract: "Smoky cookfires contribute to global climate change and kill approximately four million people annually. Manufactured fuel-efficient cookstoves have the potential to reduce these burdens. While many studies have examined the effects of fuel-efficient cookstoves, this study is the first to do so while selling stoves at market prices. Fuelwood usage and household air particulates decline by 0-2% after introducing a fuel-efficient stove. These reductions are smaller than predicted in laboratory and well short of World Health Organization pollution targets. Even when introducing a second fuel-efficient stove, most households continued to use their traditional smoky stoves for a majority of cooking time."
