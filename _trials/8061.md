abstract: "We designed, together with Finland's Ministry of Education and Culture, a randomized experiment to test the effect of preschool curriculum on the school preparedness of five year old children born in 2016-2017. Our intervention advances the starting age of mandatory preschool by one year from age 6 to age 5. In Finland, compulsory schooling starts at age 6 in preschools which are often attached to day care centers. At age 7 elementary school begins.  A special bill was passed by the parliament to mandate preschool for the 5 year old children in the treatment group. The treatment group attends preschool for two years instead of one. In the absence of treatment, most of the treatment group would attend day care and some would stay home at age 5. The treatment group follows a curriculum made by educational specialists specifically for the two-year preschool. 

Our main outcomes are arithmetic and reading skills, psychosocial skills and self esteem. They are measured during the first grade of elementary school, two years after the intervention started.
