abstract: "We collect experimental evidence to examine the descriptive validity of Anscombe & Aumann's (1963) definition of subjective probability. We document the proportion of subjects in our sample who give responses consistent with the definition and explore the responses of those who violate it. We also report at how violations co-vary with measures including competency in dealing with probabilities and demographic information."
