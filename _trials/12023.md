abstract: "Investments in early childhood development (ECD) have lifelong effects on the growth of an individual, the educational attainment of the next generation, and the economic growth of a country. Poor ECD trends persist in populations around the world, especially those in lower and middle-income countries.

Research shows that many children from less-resourced settings might not be experiencing high quality language and parent-child interaction environments necessary for healthy child development. Evidence from non-Western, as well as low-income settings in developed countries, suggests that the home language and parent-child interaction environment have a strong influence on child development outcomes. Rural China is one example of a low-income setting where the home language environment may be a significant factor of ECD. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a group training based parent-child Interaction parenting program on home language and parent-child interaction environment and ECD outcomes of children aged 12-30 months living in low-income communities.
