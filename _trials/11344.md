abstract: "This project aims to understand how people form beliefs about future events, particularly unfamiliar or novel events. We propose that memories of past experiences, both relevant and potentially irrelevant, shape these beliefs. Suppose an individual is estimating the likelihood of a significant cyberattack in the future. We argue that the individual will rely, in part, on past experiences that have some similarity to the event they are trying to imagine (a significant cyberattack). Our theory proposes that individuals who have personal experience with very similar things – for instance, identity theft – will have an easier time imagining a future cyberattack, boosting their estimates of the likelihood of it occurring. We will run a controlled experiment that investigates these memory mechanisms, exploring how exogenously varying which past (similar but objectively irrelevant) experiences “come to mind” impacts beliefs about the likelihood of future events.
