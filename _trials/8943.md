abstract: "Are revealed preferences the “true” preferences for privacy when consumers’ privacy valuations are influenced by the default frame? Should policymakers ask companies to seek consumers’ informed consent for data processing under an opt-in, opt-out, or forced-choice frame? We seek to answer these questions using a large-scale online experiment that solicit revealed preferences for consumers’ social media data under different decision frames."
