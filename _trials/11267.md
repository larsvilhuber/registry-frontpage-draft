abstract: "This study evaluates the impact of a governance intervention that aims to improve the sustainability of communal water points in Tanzania. Responsibility for the maintenance of communal infrastructure in low and middle income countries is often ambiguous, leading to inefficiency and dysfunction in public and private investments. Roughly half of the communal water points in Tanzania do not produce water. To overcome inefficiencies in the maintenance of communal infrastructure, we study an intervention that aims to strengthen coproduction between the district governments and village water community organisations, which are jointly responsible for maintaining communal water points. The intervention consists of repeated `action-learning' consultations led by an independent facilitator that encourages information sharing and the resolution of ambiguities around responsibilities for maintenance between the two parties. We evaluate its impact through a cluster-randomized controlled trial and measure impacts on the functionality of communal water points, maintenance practices, and measures of coordination between the parties."
