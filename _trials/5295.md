abstract: "Recently microfinance institutions (MFI) have started to experiment with financial products other than credit, such as savings products, to make them attractive for majority of the rural households. However, a major obstacle in these efforts is that often the uptake and use of the savings accounts is much lower than expected. Consequently, researchers started to study the causes behind the low uptake and utilization of formal savings instruments, and how the adoption and use of micro-savings accounts can be incentivized. Yet, none of the existing studies focus on Islamic MFIs. As the instruments Islamic MFIs possess to incentivize savings behavior differ from those used by conventional MFI, as Islamic microfinance institutions do not offer interest on savings accounts, it is of great importance to extend the study of questions regarding uptake and usage (as well as the impact) of micro-savings accounts to an Islamic setting. For this purpose, the study aims to examine i) take-up and usage of Islamic savings as well as ii) their impact on welfare and business activities among poor Muslim borrowers. We will further investigate what effect subsidization of motivating potential borrowers with appropriately chosen Islamic texts have/has on the aforementioned outcome variables."
