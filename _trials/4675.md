abstract: "Raskin is a national program by the Government of Indonesia (GoI) that provides subsidized rice to the poor. It is the largest social assistance program in Indonesia and the first designated to transition from in-kind delivery to electronic distribution. The study aims to test two aspects of this transition: (1) whether the transition to electronic distribution improves program effectiveness and (2) how many electronic distribution agents are needed to provide effective program delivery to beneficiaries. The project is being conducted at the district level and comprises two components, involving a total of 278 districts. The first component is a randomized impact evaluation of the transition to electronic distribution among 105 districts deemed ready for transition in 2018. The second is a randomized control trial in 216 post-transition districts, testing two different sets of criteria for establishing the minimum level of electronic distribution agent coverage available to beneficiaries."
