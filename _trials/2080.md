abstract: "Low-income individuals rarely use formal savings products and seem to show little response to traditional incentives as a result of constraints and behavioral barriers. The treatments in this evaluation, which can be implemented in any standard tablet and are easily scalable by traditional banks, propose the use of an app to give simple information to poor individuals and help them move forward with a savings plan, reinforced with the use of SMS reminders. Starting in April 2017, a pilot will be rolled out testing the effectiveness of a tablet on savings and the use of precautionary methods. A follow-up survey was conducted in the last months of 2017.  We are now analyzing the results of the follow-up."
