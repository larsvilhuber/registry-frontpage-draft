abstract: "Enhancing student awareness of their own thinking and learning could lead to improvements in academic success and persistence in their courses of study.  This project assesses whether (1) faculty/peer-tutors respond to metacognitive training and (2) there is an impact of metacognitive teaching methods in the classroom on a sample of female students of African descent at Spelman College by means of two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) over the course of three years.  The first RCT assesses whether (1) faculty respond to metacognitive training and (2) there is an impact of metacognitive teaching methods in the classroom during academic years (AY) 2016-17 and 2017-18.  The second RCT continues the former intervention while overlaying metacognitive strategies via peer-tutoring during AY 2018-19. In other words, RCT 2 implements a (2x2) design that enables us to test whether metacognitive strategies communicated in the classroom are complementary to those disseminated through peer-tutoring.

This registry/submission (October 2019) comprises the following main outcomes: (1) GPA excluding the course where the intervention is taking place; (2) a metacognitive outcome based on (a) the generalized version of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ), (b) the components of the Metacognition Awareness Index (MAI) that assess metacognitive knowledge, and (c) the components of the MAI that assess regulation; and (3) persistence/retention.  It is being submitted in order to analyze one set of research questions (as outlined in the funded proposal) in time for the Spelman FitW dissemination conference, which will take place on November 2, 2019.  See https://www.spelman.edu/fitw.  

A future update/edit to this registry/submission will comprise a separate set of research questions to be analyzed after the conference.  "
