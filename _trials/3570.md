abstract: "This study seeks to examine the psychosocial mechanisms of women’s economic engagement in Niger, particularly in the context of the Adaptive Safety Net Program (ASP). ASP includes several components (described in detail here: https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/2544), and we focus on villages where beneficiaries are offered psychosocial interventions. With a subsample of female participants, we conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment in which we vary, at the individual level, the salience of certain characteristics of the role models portrayed during a community-wide film viewing and tie those characteristics to the participant’s personal goals through a guided reflection exercise. In these additional, brief lab-in-the-field interventions, we compare the effects of two randomized psychosocial approaches to women’s economic agency: “personal initiative,” grounded in an independent self-construal and motivational style, and “interpersonal initiative,” grounded in interdependent self-construal and motivational style. We examine the influences of the experimental manipulation, and other sociocultural and economic contextual factors, on intermediate psychological, social, and economic measures as well as participation in business and life skills trainings.
