abstract: "Kahneman and Tverskyâ€™s (1992) Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) implies an assumption that agents exhibit rank dependence. Through experimentation on 153 subjects, Sprenger and Bernheim (2019) find evidence that agents do not exhibit rank-dependent probability weighting. These findings inspire our proposed research to delve deeper into investigating the implications of CPT. Specifically, this project aims to study three things: 1) reproduce and extend the analysis of Bernheim and Sprenger (2019) for rank dependence; 2) investigate sign dependence in weighting; 3) investigate sign dependence in utility. The project makes use of the equalizing reduction technique that elicits a marginal rate of substitution between two outcomes Y and Z for a given ranking and signing of outcomes. This allows us to make non-parametric statements about each of our three study objects by simply altering outcome ranks or the location of the reference point (in this study assumed to be the monetary amount provided in an envelope at the beginning of the study)."
