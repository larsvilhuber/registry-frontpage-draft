abstract: "Despite its empirical relevance, increasing returns to scale are understudied in experimental Bertrand markets. In our setting, returns to scale increase because of avoidable fixed costs. The equilibrium in this game depends on the market's sharing rule (which describes what happens in the case of equal prices). We use Bertrand duopolies to experimentally compare the symmetric sharing rule (where both of the two players serve half of the market demand) with the winner-takes-all sharing rule (where a fair randomization device decides who serves the entire market). We expect that market prices under the winner-takes-all sharing rule are higher because it provides a collusion mechanism that does the symmetric sharing rule does not. This preregistration describes the experimental design, the possible collusion mechanism, the hypotheses, the number of planned observations, and a pipeline of exploratory analyses."
