abstract: "With a randomized field trial involving 112 Kindergarten to grade 5 elementary schools (N = 9,844 third-graders), we test the effectiveness of the MORE (Model of Reading Engagement) science and social studies intervention. We examine the hypothesis that building domain and topic knowledge schemas, through thematic content literacy instruction and a personalized literacy app, could improve third-graders’ ability to comprehend science and social studies passages. The literacy app is designed to improve students’ knowledge of words related to the themes in the teacher-directed lessons and to build students’ meta-linguistic skills.  The study is implemented at scale in a southeastern US urban school district. Schools are first grouped into randomization blocks based on prior experience with the intervention, school size, and terciles of baseline reading scores and then randomly assigned to a control group which implemented science lessons and a literacy app with science content only or a treatment group which implemented science lessons and literacy app with science and social studies content and vocabulary. Students will be administered transfer measures of domain specific (science and social studies) reading comprehension, background knowledge, and reading motivation. Digital data from the literacy app will generate information on measures of behavioral engagement (total unique logins, total time on task, total activities completed) and cognitive engagement (average accuracy across all digital activities). We will conduct both confirmatory and exploratory analyses to estimate intent-to-treat impacts, meditational effects, and moderator effects. Our first confirmatory aim is to fit multi-level models nesting students within classrooms, and classrooms within schools, to generate intent-to-treat estimates of impact on transfer measures of domain specific reading comprehension. In addition, to estimate intent-to-treat estimates of impact on growth in reading, we will fit piecewise growth models across three time points to assess fall to spring growth on a vertically scaled, computer adaptive, domain general reading comprehension measure. Second, we will conduct mediational analyses to examine whether effects on reading comprehension outcomes are mediated via improvements in the vocabulary, background knowledge, reading motivation, and cognitive and behavioral engagement with a literacy application. Finally, we will examine whether treatment effects on transfer measures of reading comprehension are moderated by prior reading level (both baseline beginning of grade 3 reading), and school attendance from grade 1 to grade 3."
