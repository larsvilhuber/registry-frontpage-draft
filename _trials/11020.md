abstract: "To investigate the impact of product reviews and product orders on consumer behavior in online retail, we will recruit 5,000 participants for the experimental websites designed to simulate an online retail store. We will assign several treatments to investigate the effect of information on consumer behavior, including two types of user reviews, three types of product orders, three types of review orders, two-sided information provisions, and a warning message against the existence of incorrect or misleading reviews.

The first type of review is based on reviews that have been deleted from an online retail website, while the other type of review is based on reviews that have not been deleted. We will sort the order of products by user rating for products, by the number of user ratings for products, and by random. We will sort the order of reviews by user rating for reviews, by newest, and by random.

To determine the willingness to pay for a product, we will use an incentive-compatible questionnaire.

Additionally, we will collect information from participants regarding their experience with online retailing, their level of trust in online retailing, risk attitudes, information-seeking attitudes, participating environments, impressions of our experimental websites, and socio-demographic characteristics. We will also record click log data from our experimental websites. Using this information, we will estimate the treatment effect of information structure on consumer behavior, the effect of the information on the consumer surplus, search cost, information processing costs, and the prior for the goods to better understand the treatment effect."
