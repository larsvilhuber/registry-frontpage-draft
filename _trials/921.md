abstract: "South Africa has moved from a situation of water stress to one of water scarcity as a result of pressures from population growth, climate change, over-consumption and urbanization. We study the effectiveness of non-price instruments at promoting water conservation in the residential sector in Cape Town, South Africa's second largest city. Using inserts in monthly customer bills, we test nine behavioral messages (treatments) in a randomized control trial on 412,489 households. The treatments are classified into four groups: public-good framing (voluntary contributions to a common goal/good), financial framing (focusing on the financial losses/gains associated with inefficient/efficient water usage), social-comparison framing (where household consumption is compared to that of other households) and social-recognition framing (recognizing water conservation).
