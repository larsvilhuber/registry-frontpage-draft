abstract: "It is generally agreed upon that the most vital step towards integrating into a new culture is learning the spoken language. The language barrier issue could delay social integration and productivity outcomes. The use of mobile-assisted language learning applications along with integration course attendance may improve, through several channels, the language-learning and social integration outcomes among immigrants in Germany. We will conduct an RCT among migrants and refugees, in order to estimate the effect of encouraging the use of the German language-learning and similar applications on the study populationÂ´s German skills and social integration outcomes. We tend to focus on the application "Ankommen" since it includes several social integration topics as well as the fact that it has been developed by the German federal office for migration and refugees. We hypothesis that using the help of mobile learning to get to know important cultural aspects would increase social integration efforts and improve language level outcomes.
