abstract: "The Hake fish (or merluza), a popular source of protein for low and middle-income Chileans, is now critically threatened by over-fishing. The government has passed regulations to protect hake, such as a ban on fishing and consumption during September, when the hake reproduces, but have faced challenges in enforcing regulations effectively. This project seeks to experimentally evaluate the impact of two complementary interventions that aim to reduce the over capture of hake fish during its ban period: (1) Informing vendors about the ban and penalizing those that sell illegal fish during September and (2) a consumer information campaign designed to sensitize them about this environmental problem and discourage the consumption of hake during the ban."
