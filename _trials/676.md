abstract: "Despite global trends highlighting improvements in reproductive and maternal and child health, estimates from the Demographic and Health Surveys indicate that contraceptive prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa among women of reproductive age (aged 15-49) is just 22 percent, which is less than half that of South Asia (51 percent) and less than a third that of East Asia (78 percent). In Kenya, 25% of currently married women are not using a contraceptive method, despite having no current intention to become pregnant, signifying a high unmet need for contraception (KDHS 2008).  Contraceptive discontinuation has been identified as a major factor influencing high levels of unmet need, with more than one in three contraceptive users in Kenya discontinuing use within 12 months of method uptake (KDHS 2008). In recent literature, contraceptive discontinuation is associated with low-quality family planning counseling, including lack of information about common side effects and strategies for dealing with side effects and danger signs. A mobile phone-based platform to deliver enhanced contraceptive method-specific information and to improve ease, quality, and quantity of counseling for new family planning users will explore a unique mechanism to support contraceptive continuation among low-income women in Nairobi. The intervention is comprised of a set of SMS counseling and informational messages aimed specifically at the method type chosen by new family planning users, with interactivity that will allow for nurses to call clients regarding specific counseling needs. Through a randomized controlled design, the study will evaluate the impact of the enhanced SMS-based counseling program on adherence to routine follow-up, contraceptive continuation, satisfaction, and knowledge about side effects and common myths and misconceptions surrounding contraceptive use.
