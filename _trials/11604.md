abstract: "Being admitted to top-quality education is highly consequential for long-term outcomes. Admissions to top schools are determined by performing well in high-stakes exams in many countries around the world. Yet, a growing body of evidence shows that men outperform women in these important exams. To date, there is scarce evidence as to how and why gender differences in performance arise in high pressure, high-stakes situations. We design an experiment to explore female exam underperformance when the pressure goes up in a controlled environment. In the experiment, we give Prolific workers a series of two Raven's-type short tests containing easy, middle-difficulty and hard questions. After completing the baseline test (Test 1), we introduce treatments in Test 2 varying the level of pressure faced by participants in two ways: (1) We introduce a cutoff that determines whether participants receive a bonus payment, and (2) We increase the monetary payment per correct answer by a factor of fifteen. We measure whether the treatments induce underperformance relative to a control group, and whether there are gender differences in underperformance. We will collect the data for this experiment in June 2023."
