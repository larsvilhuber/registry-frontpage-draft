abstract: "We will use a Randomised Control Trial (RCT) to evaluate the impact on women’s empowerment of repaying microfinance loans using mobile money instead of the traditional method of repaying using cash. Our sample consists of 750 female microfinance borrowers with existing small enterprises in rural and peri-urban areas of Tanzania. We will randomly assign women to either 1) a control group maintaining repayment of the loan with cash at weekly group meetings, 2) a treatment arm repaying the loan weekly using mobile money alongside weekly group meetings or 3) a treatment arm repaying the loan weekly using mobile money but shifting to fortnightly group meetings. We will examine the take-up of mobile money repayment, using characteristics of the women at baseline and random price subsidies. We will examine the impact of the treatments on women’s empowerment at endline using a combination of survey questions and incentivized games to measure different dimensions of women’s agency and well-being. We will also understand the mechanisms through which any impacts on women’s empowerment are channeled by examining changes in female business outcomes, changes in use of mobile money services for both person and business transactions, and changes in microfinance group social cohesion.
