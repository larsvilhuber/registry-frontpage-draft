abstract: "Obtaining accurate information on behaviors and attitudes considered sensitive has posed a challenge for social science researchers. Directly asking sensitive questions can lead to misreporting or nonresponses as respondents may misrepresent their true responses for fear of repercussions, to conform to social norms, or to avoid shame. These inaccurate responses introduce systematic measurement error and bias to the estimates of sensitive behaviours and subsequent inferences. To mitigate this bias, indirect response (IR) techniques, such as the List Experiment (LE), have been used in surveys to better identify estimates of sensitive behavior. We will apply the List Experiment to measure and characterize inconsistencies in reporting of Intimate Partner Violence in a Kenyan sample. We will further test the validity of the technique applying novel methods in the context of the Global South though generalizable to other contexts."
