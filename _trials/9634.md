abstract: "We will recruit a sample of 300 chicken and cattle-owning households in Busia county, western Kenya to participate in a randomized controlled trial. Prior to randomization, we will administer a baseline survey (visit 1). Households will then be assigned treatment or control group status. The treatment group will receive a bookkeeping intervention. They will keep these records for three months. After the three-month period ends, we will elicit willingness-to-pay (WTP) for ND vaccine in control and treatment groups using an incentivized measure (i.e., a measure with real stakes) and administer an end-line survey (visit 3). In addition, we will study take-up of acaricides at market prices."
