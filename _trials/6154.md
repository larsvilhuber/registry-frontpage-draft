abstract: "When social networks generate redistributive pressures, labor supply decisions are undertaken in a social context. Individuals who optimize labor supply do so with the understanding that some of their earnings may be subject to taxation within the network; if they are capable of avoiding this tax by not working, then labor supply will be distorted downwards. If the unemployed exert greater redistributive pressure, then this insight leads to the theoretical possibility of multiple equilibria in networks: networks may be characterized by equilibria where few work and where the incentives to work are poor, or alternatively by equilibria where many work and the incentives to work are high (Hoff and Sen 2011). While experimental evidence indicates that important redistributive pressure exists for windfall gains (e.g. Jakiela and Ozier 2015) we know much less about whether these pressures generate unemployment in practice.

In this project, we test for the presence of externalities in labor supply and multiple employment equilibria, using a hiring experiment implemented in Côte d’Ivoire with a large agri-processing company."
