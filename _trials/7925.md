abstract: "This project aims to improve the outreach and education efforts to return preparers and taxpayers implemented by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as part of the agency’s broader strategy to reduce errors in claiming benefits by intervening early and ensuring compliance with the law. Specifically, this project aims to build evidence on the effectiveness of the pre-filing season educational letters that the IRS sends to clients of return preparers and the effectiveness of program changes to this strategy. The Letter 6138 informs clients that their return may contain errors in claiming benefits, provides tips to selecting a return preparer, and advises the taxpayer to review the return for errors in claiming certain benefits. 

The General Service Administration’s (GSA’s) Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES), and the IRS’s Research, Applied Analytics and Statistics (RAAS) and Wage and Investment (W&I) divisions collaborated on this project to measure the effects of sending the Letter 6138 to clients of return preparers on a number of outcomes, including returns filed with errors claiming certain benefits and clients’ tax filing method. Additionally, this project will examine the effects of the Letter 6138 on clients who used the same return preparer, but were not themselves sent a Letter 6138 (i.e., the indirect or network effect of the Letter 6138) and explore whether the Letter 6138 affected the returns prepared by return preparers during filing season 2021. Finally, the project will examine whether sending a modified behavioral insights (BI) Letter 6138 affects the outcomes of clients differently from sending clients the treatment-as-usual (TAU) Letter 6138.
