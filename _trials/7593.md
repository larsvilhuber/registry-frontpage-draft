abstract: "Wage transparency regulation is a promising tool to decrease the gender pay gap (Recalde and Vesterlund, 2020). Several European countries adopted such regulation in recent years, among them Germany. We study the effectiveness of the German policy using large scale representative survey data, exploiting an exogenous cutoff in firm size that determines whether companies are subject to this regulation. Furthermore, we want to investigate the conditions that facilitate a successful transparency policy in a laboratory experiment. In this, we focus on how wage transparency has an impact on gender differences in negotiation outcomes. The experiment varies along two dimensions. First, we manipulate the type of information provided, specifically whether only wage information or also information on relative performance is available. Adding information on relative performance removes uncertainty about justifications for wage inequality in negotiations. Second, we vary how this information is provided, endogenously or exogenously. Here, we address that low take-up can render wage transparency policies ineffective. "
