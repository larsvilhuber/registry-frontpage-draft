abstract: "We study the impact of after-school programs (ASP) for teenagers in 21 public schools in the most violent neighborhoods of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. Schools were randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions: activities such as sports, art, and dancing; a curriculum that aims to strengthen participants’ character; or a mindfulness-based and relaxation response program. We will evaluate the impact of these interventions on measures of well-being, academic performance, and social and emotional competence as well as cognitive and non-cognitive development. We also selected a group of eight schools as pure controls with a propensity score approach, which will allow us to study the mechanism of the ASP effect—that is, intervention or protection. Participants meet once per week during one academic year (between 7-8 months) after-school time, with an approximate duration of 1-1.5 hours. This research will permit us to test the effect of different strategies aimed at decreasing violence for young people in a highly violent context and to test their mechanisms.
