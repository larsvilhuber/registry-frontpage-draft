abstract: "We seek to investigate the determinants of mobile money underadoption in Jordan on both sides of the market using a field experiment. Specifically, we elicit consumers' and merchants' willingness to pay for mobile money through an incentive-compatible mechanism and quantify the role of various behavioral factors that we suspect hinder adoption. Our treatments cover a wide set of behavioral factors that are commonly identified as significant barriers to adoption in previous research, such as attention, digital financial literacy, and trust, as well as rational explanations that deem underadoption in two-sided markets as a coordination failure.
