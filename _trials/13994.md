abstract: "Political apathy and skepticism toward traditional authorities are increasingly common, but social media creators (SMCs) capture the public's attention. Despite their prominence, whether these seemingly-frivolous yet engaging actors shape political attitudes and behaviors remains largely unknown. Our field experiment estimates the impact of encouraging Americans aged 18-45 to follow five progressive policy-minded SMCs on Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube for five months. Participants are randomly assigned to follow SMCs producing predominantly-apolitical and non-partisan or predominantly-political content; we cross-randomize recommendation-only or additional financial incentives to follow assigned SMCs. We then measure participants' political engagement, policy attitudes and priorities, progressive worldviews, voting behavior, non-electoral participation, and institutional and interpersonal trust. The comparison between treatment conditions, and against a pure control and several placebo groups, will evaluate the persuasive potential of sustained exposure to previously-unfollowed SMCs. Our findings will illuminate the role of SMCs as modern-day opinion leaders defining political communication in American democracy."
