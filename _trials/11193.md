abstract: "This study compares the effects of in-person vs. mobile business training on the performance of women entrepreneurs in Ethiopia. A group of 2,000 women entrepreneurs based in Addis Ababa and who are interested in business training are randomized to receive access to either a business app adapted to the Ethiopian context (1000 women), an in-person business training covering the same material than the app (500 women), or a control group (500 women). To simulate the interaction offered by in-person training, half of women offered the app (500 women) are encouraged to participate in virtual chat rooms to discuss their progress as they use the app. All women are invited to information sessions where they are provided help in downloading the app if selected. In a second experiment we test whether sharing the app virtually without the need of a first in-person interaction can achieve similar effects."
