abstract: "Recent research shows that complementarities between inputs in the education production function might be harnessed by implementing two policies simultaneously. However, budget constraints may make fully funding both policies infeasible, forcing school districts to choose between fully funding one policy or partially funding several. To address this issue, we conduct a field experiment where $90 of financial incentives are provided to either one input (students, parents, or tutors) or spread equally among multiple inputs to improve on a standardized test and meet other standards. The results suggest a limited amount of financial incentives has a greater impact on student achievement when directed at just one input. "
