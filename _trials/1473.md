abstract: "Clustered RCT to investigate an intervention delivered to year 3 pupils,  designed to try to help pupils who are behind

the class average in numeracy. It is expected that a substantial proportion of these children might

have lower performance in working memory. The intervention combines two aspects of working

memory training: strategies and practice. The strategies (rehearsal, association, using fingers) are

taught by Teaching Assistants (TAs) in structured sessions, with support from computer games.

Practice is encouraged by use of the computer games. The tuition and computer game time take place additionally

to maths teaching.

The primary research question this evaluation is designed to answer is:

 What is the effect of WM and WM+ on children’s number skills at the end of year 3?

The evaluation will also estimate the impact of WM and WM+ on the following secondary outcomes:

 Working memory at the end of year 3

 Attention and behaviour in class at the end of year 3.

Impact will also be estimated separately for pupils receiving free schools meals."
