abstract: "In this paper, we explore the role of supply chain networks in shaping macroeconomic expectations. We address this question using a theoretical model that integrates firm networks and the transmission of macroeconomic shocks, combined with a randomized control trial of 1074 firm-firm pairs in New Zealand. By introducing exogenous variation in expectation through an information treatment that provides the 2025 GDP forecast (mean or variance) to treated firms, we analyze both the direct effects on firms receiving this information and the network effect on connected firms that did not directly receive information. One of the key contributions of this project is to explore how communication and other transmission channels such as observing price changes along the supply chain -- which may differ between upstream and downstream firm connections -- influence firms' expectation formation. In macroeconomics, expectation formation is a critical issue, and supply chains present a potentially underexplored mechanism. The insights from our findings will have important implications for how central banks communicate information to firms."
