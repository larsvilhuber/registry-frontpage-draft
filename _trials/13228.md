abstract: "In the current nudging literature, several have called for more research on the combination of behavioral interventions as a promising avenue to see larger effects (Nisa et al., 2019), and it has also been claimed that combinations of nudges and monetary interventions may be particularly effective in promoting pro-environmental behavior (see e.g. Alt et al., 2024). Most of the research on policy mixes has been done in the energy domain (Allcott et al., 2014; Drews et al., 2020; Fanghella et al., 2021) and there is a lack of research on policy mixes in the food domain. Furthermore, the existing research on policy mixing in the food domain mainly focuses on promoting healthy food products (Ahn & Lusk, 2021; Papoutsi et al., 2015; Vo et al., 2022). The purpose of this study is, first, to investigate the effect of combining a climate label on food with a climate rebate, and second, to examine how effects of each incentive individually and in combination interact with personal norms for climate friendly behavior. We contribute to the literature on incentives to promote climate friendly food consumption by combining a positive incentive with a positive label. Both the label and the price reduction presentation are developed in cooperating with an online food retailer to increase the realism of the choice tasks. The motivation for focusing on strategies that can be implemented by an online supermarket is to increase the relevance and realism of the choice experiment, since national level policies to reduce emissions from food production through reducing demand for meat are not currently politically feasible in Norway (see e.g. Larsson and Vik, 2023). However, the design is still relevant for understanding the potential effects of government policies, such as mandatory climate labels, or subsidies for less emission intensive foods. An important contribution will be to investigate synergies between financial incentives and food labeling.
