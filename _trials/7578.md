abstract: "In many cases people receive information about products after their choice, which in turn affects future buying/selling decisions (e.g. financial assets, switching markets). This project studies how choice itself - beyond the effect of ownership - changes how people use information to update their beliefs about products. In the lab, using a between-subject design, participants learn about the fundamental quality
of financial investments by observing price changes. We examine how they update beliefs after positive (e.g. price increase) and negative (i.e. price decrease) signals. The goal is to compare people who choose the investments themselves to people who receive the same investments exogenously. This comparison allows us to isolate the effect of choice from the effect of ownership."
