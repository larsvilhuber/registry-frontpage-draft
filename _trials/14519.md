abstract: "Female representation in the Economics profession remains disproportionately low, with women making up only 35% of academic staff in South African university departments. This underrepresentation is often attributed to the "leaky pipeline," where women exit the field at higher rates from undergraduate studies through to professorship. While most research on this issue has focused on Global North contexts, less is known about the dynamics in the Global South. This study examines two hypotheses: (1) that students lack awareness of the diverse career opportunities available in Economics, and (2) that exposure to female economists as role models could increase female students' interest in the field. To investigate, we conducted focus groups to explore female students' career interests and then implemented a randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving approximately 1,000 students across five South African universities. Students were randomly assigned to either a treatment group, which viewed video interviews with female economists discussing their careers, or a control group, which watched interviews with health experts providing wellness advice. The study assesses the impact of the intervention on students’ aspirations in Economics by analyzing two outcome variables: a revealed outcome—the number of students applying for postgraduate studies in Economics—and stated outcomes based on students' agreement with various statements regarding their interest in Economics, collected at baseline and endline surveys. The study could improve our understanding why female students disproportionately exit Economics from undergraduate to postgraduate levels in South Africa. "
