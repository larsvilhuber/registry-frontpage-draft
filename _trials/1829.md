abstract: "This project studies the effects of part-time work (compared to full-time) on selection and productivity in the context of data entry jobs in Ethiopia. We will examine these issues in a close collaboration with Africa Future Foundation (AFF), an international non-governmental organization (NGO) that will hire part- and full-time data entry clerks in Ethiopia. This study will make two sets of contributions. First, it will contribute to the literature on how job attributes (i.e., compensation schemes and labor contracts) affect worker selection and labor productivity by examining how part-time employment affects productivity. Second, this study will explore what types of applicants will be self-selected into part-time jobs, which are preferred by women especially those who have young children. Findings from our study will have important implications for labor markets in which women could benefit from part-time work. "
