abstract: "Empirical social sciences increasingly rely on data derived from sefl-administered web (SAW) surveys, but such survey modes suffer from low response rates. Understanding survey respondent behavior is critical to finding successful ways to increase response rates and improve data quality. There is a gap in the research literature in particular on the role of procrastination and commitment devices in respodnents' decisions to complete surveys in a timely fashion.

This study is a survey protocol experiment designed to test whether self-administered web surveys can achieve higher response rates by asking respondents to commit to a specific narrow window of time instead of the full data collection period. For example, would respondents be more likely to compete a survey if they were given a particular day and a three-hour time slot within which to complete (and an option to reschedule) instead of a one--week window? 

Study subjects, 331 participants in an RCT on job training for survey enumerators, are randomly assigned to either be given a long window or a narrow window with a specific appointment time (3-hour period on a given day) to complete the survey by web. For the narrow window group, the link is only active for the specified period. For subjects in the other treatment arm, they are only given an end date and may access the survey at any time. The study's outcome is survey completion."
