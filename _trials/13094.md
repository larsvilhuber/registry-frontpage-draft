abstract: "Facebook Marketplace was created in 2016 to compete with Craigslist in the market for in-person sales of used goods. Within two years, Facebook Marketplace had over 800 million active users worldwide. One of the main advantages of Marketplace over Craigslist is that buyers can attempt to infer product quality and safety of in-person meetings from sellers' Facebook profiles. Pictures, gender, age, race, marriage status, among others can be seen or inferred from the profile of sellers. This information can be used when deciding to buy and negotiate for a product. This research examines the extent, and potential causes, of discrimination on Marketplace via a field experiment. We build fictitious Facebook profiles that are identical except for race, gender, or age. We then make offers for a set of commonly sold products through these profiles and compare the effect of both sellers' and buyers' demographic characteristics on the number and size of offers. "
