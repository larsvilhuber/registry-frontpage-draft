abstract: "Skills trainings are often a central component of contemporary development assistance strategies, but much of the evidence base for their efficacy comes from high-income countries. RCTs in developing countries are still far less numerous. We contribute to this literature with a rigorous impact evaluation of a program for the empowerment and education of young women in Ghana, called Network for Enterprise Development Learning through Sewing for Girls (N4G). The program will deliver fashion-industry related training and empowerment programs to up to 1,000 underprivileged Ghanaian young women from both urban and rural areas. Beneficiaries are randomly selected from approximately 2,000 baseline respondents. We use a randomized controlled trial to estimate effects of the N4G program on four groups of outcomes: (i) employment, measured for example in terms of employment status, job acquisition, and lengths of employment spells, (ii) job quality, including earnings, having a contract or an oral agreement, job satisfaction, and workplace conditions among others, (iii) quality of life, covering indicators of the current living situation, household assets, and financial dependency, and (iv) mobility, e.g. migration intentions and behaviors."
