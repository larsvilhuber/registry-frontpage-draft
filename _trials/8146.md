abstract: "The study investigates the impact of charismatic leadership communication tools on worker performance in the gig economy. Previous studies have demonstrated that the usage of charisma can increase followerâ€™s performance in face to face settings (Antonakis et al 2021, Ernst et al. 2021). But we know relatively little about the impact of charismatic communication in virtual settings. Recently Ernst et al. 2021 have shown that charismatic communication does not have a significant impact on follower performance in a virtual setting when subjects watch a video and participate in an online experiment whereas Meslec et al. 2020 report a positive impact of charisma on performance if subjects watch a video but then work on-side. Fest et al. 2021 have shown that charismatic communication can have a positive impact when given as a written text in the gig economy. Thus, the evidence is sparse and calls for further studies. This project studies the impact of charismatic communication and communication channels in the gig economy in a controlled RCT."
