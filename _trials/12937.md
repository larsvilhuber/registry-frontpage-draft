abstract: "The goal of this research project is to test whether parents’ perceptions of occupational fit affect students’ occupational aspirations and their beliefs about fit in certain occupations. Particularly, we will test whether increasing the salience of parents’ perceptions of occupational fit increases the occupational segregation by gender. To test this hypothesis, we designed a field experiment where we for treated students i) provide information about what other parents think would be a good occupational fit for their child, and ii) increase the salience of their own parents. We compare the treated group to a control group that does not receive information about other parents nor answer questions about their parents.

The randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be implemented among students from the German-speaking parts of Switzerland who plan to do an apprenticeship. In this setting, around two-thirds of a birth cohort will do an apprenticeship after compulsory education (typically starting after 9th grade). Although there are various possibilities for further training and education after the completion of an apprenticeship, the initial choice of the occupation of the apprenticeship is deterministic of eventual occupational choice.
