abstract: "This study will undertake an analysis of the relationship between perceived and estimated air pollution exposure, risk perception and behaviour. The overarching aim of the study is to explore dimensions of vulnerability and how they link to awareness, perceptions and behaviour. We aim to describe the overlapping dimensions of vulnerability (susceptibility, exposure and adaptation); quantify where there are gaps in awareness, perceptions, and behaviours in relation to air pollution exposure and avoidance; and whether these vary by vulnerability status. We will also examine the extent to which perception differs from actual exposure and the heterogeneity of this outcome by domain (within the home, local area and commute) and the vulnerability status of the respondent (age, health morbidities and status)."
