abstract: "The COVID-19 pandemic has increased demand for virtual early learning programs in low- and middle-income countries. However, little is known about these programs’ effectiveness or how they may address post-pandemic opportunity gaps for marginalized populations at scale. This study will examine the sustained impacts of Afini, a technology-based, interactive chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to recommend customized, culturally-sensitive activities that parents complete with young children (0- to 3-year-olds) to promote early learning and development. To do so, we will follow families participating in the national parenting program that aims to provide child stimulation for children living in poverty in the State of Ceará, Brazil. Using a multifactorial randomized controlled trial, we will (1) estimate the sustained impacts of Afini on parental behavior, mental health, and child development outcomes, (2) explore whether these impacts vary across different dimensions (e.g., child gender, maternal education, child development at baseline), (3) identify the components of Afini (e.g., delivery platform) that maximize cost-effectiveness. We will also conduct a qualitative assessment to gather participants’ feedback, regarding program benefits and drawbacks. This research will inform policymakers on whether and how to implement digital learning programs for low-income families in a scalable setting. In doing so, we aim to promote more positive and equitable trajectories of life-long learning at scale for children in low- and middle-income countries."
