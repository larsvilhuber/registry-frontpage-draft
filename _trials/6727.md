abstract: "We conduct incentive-compatible choice experiments to measure the economic value of digital data. We focus on the value that users place on their personal data related to the biggest social media platform: Facebook. We will use BDM methods to elicit their valuation for their Facebook data. For the baseline valuations, we simply ask them their WTA to part with all of their Facebook data.  After eliciting their baseline valuation, we will randomize information to individuals about Facebook settlements after data breaches and as well as the amount of revenue per user generated by Facebook. We will then evaluate how individuals update (or not) their valuations based on the information. Finally, we will randomly draw from a distribution and invite selected individuals to upload their data and receive their stated valuation."
