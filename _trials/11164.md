abstract: "Energy conservation plays a crucial role in mitigating climate change. While past studies have primarily focused on adults when exploring energy conservation initiatives, there is a growing interest in educational programs aimed at children and teenagers. Can these younger generations act as catalysts for energy conservation within their families? This study seeks to address this question through a randomized controlled trial.

Our intervention is a school-based education program that aims to reduce household electricity consumption by educating children and teenagers. We plan to recruit around 2,400 students in grades 4-8 (approximately aged 9-15) from about 20 participating schools across five Chinese cities: Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Luzhou, and Wuhan. Each school will have an average of four participating classes, with around 30 students per class. We will also recruit one guardian for each student, resulting in a total sample size of approximately 4,800 participants. Half of the classes will be randomly assigned to the treatment group, which will receive a five-week program focusing on education and activities related to electricity conservation, while the other half will be randomized into the control group and will not receive the intervention.

A baseline survey will be conducted before the start of the intervention, followed by an endline survey two months after the intervention concludes. The surveys will include a student questionnaire and a guardian questionnaire to measure pre- and post-intervention characteristics and outcomes, including knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to electricity conservation, and objective data on weekly household electricity consumption. This randomized experimental design, combined with micro-level data, will allow us to investigate the following questions: 1) Is the program effective at promoting energy-saving attitudes and behaviors among children and teenagers? 2) Could changes in attitudes and behaviors be transmitted to parents and other family members through interactions within the family? 3) Could these changes subsequently lead to reductions in family energy consumption?"
