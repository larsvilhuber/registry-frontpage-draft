abstract: "According to survey findings, active job seekers significantly overestimate young
firms’ exit rates—64 percent (belief) vs. 20 percent (actual). Do young firms pay
for workers’ incorrect beliefs? Analyzing the resume data, young firms are matched
with a weaker pool of candidates, yet wages at young firms are higher for the
observationally equivalent workers. This hiring pattern is largely driven by the labor supply
as evidence from job ads does not show any difference between old and young firms’ labor
demands. In this paper, I will run a series of experiments to show 1. Job candidates
have incorrect beliefs about exit rate and performance of young firms 2. Job candidates
demand a higher premium from this incorrect belief 3. Simple information provision
about small young firms’ performance can help improve hiring in young firms."
