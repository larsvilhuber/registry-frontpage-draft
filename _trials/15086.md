abstract: "Entrepreneurial success relies on achieving early-stage sales success, which is essential for generating revenue, validating business models, and building initial product-market fit. Without reaching (and then surpassing) the break-even sales level, new ventures can quickly run out of runway as customers and cash flow disappear. Despite the critical role played by the 'selling' function, effective methods for accelerating sales growth in new ventures remain underexplored and lack empirical evidence
This study evaluates a two-phase program through a randomized controlled field experiment. The first phase, Market Readiness, helps entrepreneurs develop and validate a minimum viable product (MVP) using structured decision-making tools. The second phase, Sales Growth, leverages a digital platform with gamified exercises, interactive modules, and personalized coaching to optimize sales processes.
The findings aim to bridge gaps in evidence-based entrepreneurial research, offering scalable solutions for driving sales growth and fostering business success."
