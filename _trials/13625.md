abstract: "This study proposes a theory-based perspective on path dependency, emphasizing the impact of both internal and external initial conditions on economic decision-making processes. Building on the framework established by David (2007), we argue that internal factors, particularly actors’ initial beliefs and priors, play a crucial role in shaping decision trajectories and influencing the likelihood of sub-optimal lock-ins. We identify four pathways through which decision makers form their priors: 1) Ignoring path dependency, thereby risking commitment to inferior paths with a single theory and an outside option; 2) Acknowledging path dependency but failing to consider unforeseen contingencies, which may lead to sub-optimal lock-ins; 3) Anticipating new information, events, and shocks, thereby adjusting their theory’s value to account for unforeseen developments; 4) Evaluating multiple theories of value, which can help avoid sub-optimal lock-ins. We hypothesize that economic actors who anticipate path dependency and unknown events and develop multiple theories of value are less likely to experience sub-optimal lock-ins. The QWERTY keyboard case is reinterpreted through these four lenses to underscore the importance of initial internal condition setting."
