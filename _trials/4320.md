abstract: "We evaluate the impact of an intervention aimed at informing high school guidance counselors of the advantages of the Economics degree. Our outcomes of interest are student take-up of the economics major and subsequent labor market outcomes. We focus on Texas high schools that tend to send a high number of students to Texas A&M University. We randomly select high schools to receive an invitation to participate in a workshop at Texas A&M in early September 2019. The workshop, targeted at guidance counselors, provided information on the advantages to majoring in economics. In Fall 2020, counselors at other randomly selected high schools received an invitation to participate in an online informational workshop. A third set of schools acts as a control group. "
