abstract: "We collaborate with a retail company and we investigate changes in the decision-making authority of salesworkers to grant discounts to customers. In the current system, the salesworkers are relatively free in their ability to give discounts, but the company wishes to restrict the salesworkers' autonomy. In an RCT, we investigate one new system under which workers are less free to give discounts and we compare this system to the original system. We study how the different discount systems affect the granted discounts, conversion rates (i.e., the rate at which customers being served by salesworkers buy the firm's products), revenues per customer and total revenue.
