abstract: "This trial will evaluate the impact of a weekly tele-mentoring program in rural South-West Bangladesh. The program is delivered by university student volunteers to elementary school-aged children and their parents for a 12-week period over the phone. Due to prolonged school closure during the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of children is missing out on a range of educational input, especially if they lack access to the necessary educational technology or their parents do not have the ability, confidence, motivation, or skills to engage in their education. In this context, we examine whether the tele-mentoring program (i) improves children’s cognitive skills, (ii) increases parental engagement in children’s educational and other activities, (iii) changes children’s social preferences, and (iv) affects parents’ perception about their parenting ability and style."
