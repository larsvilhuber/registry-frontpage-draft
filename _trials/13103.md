abstract: "This study focuses on testing approaches of debunking misconceptions about air quality among residents of Birmingham. Prior research conducted by Birmingham City Council suggests that many Birmingham residents hold false beliefs about air quality. The aims of this trial are to: 1) evaluate individuals' baseline knowledge of air quality and awareness of behaviors that can impact air quality and 2) assess the impact of debunking misconceptions about air quality using myth-first debunking and refutational text debunking techniques."
