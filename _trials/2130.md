abstract: "The goal of this project is to understand whether it is possible and desirable to charge a positive price for business-training programs. We elicit willingness to pay for a course for entrepreneurs in Jamaica. First, we estimate the demand schedule for the program. Second, we study whether willingness to pay can act as a screening device to select those entrepreneurs who would benefit the most from participation in training programs. Third, we test whether there is a sunk-cost effect by which those who pay a higher price for the program exercise more effort (attend the training more regularly) and achieve higher returns. This project is relevant to understand whether we can increase the effect of business-training programs by targeting, and whether providers can achieve financial sustainability by charging a positive price without screening out a large share of entrepreneurs who might participate only if the program is offered for free.
