abstract: "This study evaluates the impact of different components of the Skills for Jobs (S4J) training program, an intervention by the Nigerian government aimed at addressing skill gaps and unemployment among youth. The program provides three types of skills training: life skills, vocational/sector specific skills, and entrepreneurship skills, as well as a paid internship. Participants are randomized into three treatment groups that receive (i) vocational and entrepreneurship training only, (ii) Vocational, entrepreneurship and life skills training only, or (iii) the full S4J package. A control group receives no training. In addition, several months following the training components, all three treatment groups receive a cash grant from the government to support them in establishing new businesses. "
