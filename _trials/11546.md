abstract: "In this research paper, we aim to investigate the extent to which humans trust the output of LLMs to be factually accurate. While LLMs have showcased impressive capabilities in understanding and generating text, concerns have been raised regarding the potential for misinformation, biases, or inaccuracies in their responses. To explore this issue, we ask human subjects to rate the accuracy of statements written by humans and ChatGPT. We vary whether each statement was written by a human or by ChatGPT, and we also vary whether we inform participants about who/what wrote the statements. "
