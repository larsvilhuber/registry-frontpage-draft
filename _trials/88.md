abstract: "The Ghana Graduation from Ultra Poverty (GUP) project is a part of the CGAP/Ford Foundation global initiative, currently being implemented in eight countries, that combines safety net programs with entrepreneurial activities to develop a graduation model for the poorest households. GUP aims to help chronically poor households move from extreme poverty into self-sufficiency over a twenty-four month period by providing treatment households with consumption support, productive assets, financial education, and savings.  In addition, the project also seeks to disentangle the relationship of savings from the success of ultra-poverty programs through the Savings Out of Ultra Poverty (SOUP) treatment, which provides both matched and non-matched savings accounts to beneficiaries.

In 2010, 3850 households in 241 villages were identified as ultra-poor through a community participatory wealth ranking process.  Villages were randomly selected to either receive the GUP or the SOUP treatment or to be a part of the comparison group. Individual households within the treatment villages were then randomly selected to receive various sub-treatments. A baseline survey was completed in February 2011, with midline surveys every six months for the next 2 years. The endline survey was completed in September 2013.  An additional agriculture-focused endline survey will be conducted in January 2014, and a follow-up survey in July 2014.
