abstract: "Objectives. This study experimentally assessed whether alcohol television storylines impact youth drinking attitudes and intentions and whether corrective epilogues can moderate this impact. 

Methods. Participants aged 14-17 completed the online study. Television episodes were professionally produced showing heavy drinking leading to either positive or negative consequences. The episode was shown alone or with an epilogue where a main character discussed the deleterious impacts of excessive drinking. Attitudes toward drinkers and drinking intentions were measured subsequently, along with reactions to the episode and demographic data.

Results. Exposure to the pro-alcohol episode led to more positive attitudes toward drinkers and greater drinking intentions but a corrective video epilogue successfully reduced this detrimental effect. However, including an epilogue after an anti-alcohol episode backfired, resulting in a boomerang effect.

Conclusions. Viewing a single television episode with a pro-alcohol message can lead to more positive attitudes toward drinkers and promote youthsâ€™ intentions to consume alcohol. The finding that a brief epilogue reduced the impact of the pro-alcohol storyline suggests easily implemented preventive strategies to counter the adverse impact of substance use portrayals in entertainment programming.
