abstract: "The study investigates digital leadership and performance in the gig economy. Previous studies have demonstrated that the usage of different communication channels, as well as the chosen leadership style, can potentially affect followersâ€™ performance in gig labor markets. However, the evidence is mixed and we lack a clear understanding of the signaling value of the chosen communication channel and style. Whereas previous studies have manipulated the channel and style exogenously without informing the workers about the potential options, the current set-up will focus on the active choice by employers and its signaling value. 
In particular, this study focuses on the choice of individuals in the role of employers as well as the performance of workers being exposed to the chosen set of task instructions. The study addresses the following questions: Which communication channel do employers choose? Are there differences between the chosen channels depending on the leadership style? How does the employer's choice affect worker performance if the workers know the employer had different options?
