abstract: "Although evaluations of tutoring programs find large effects on student achievement, few programs have been successfully implemented at-scale. We examine the effectiveness of a district-wide high-dosage tutoring initiative in a large urban school district that will serve 7,000 students by the end of the 2021-22 school year. Students participating in the program during the Fall 2021 semester will be paired with a teacher, paraprofessional, college student, or community volunteer and attend tutoring sessions 3 times per week for 30-45 minutes per session and on a recurring basis for 10 weeks. To determine the effectiveness of this tutoring program, we randomize 68 schools to either begin participation in the tutoring program in Fall 2021 or Spring 2022. We estimate the impacts of participating in this program in Fall 2021 on Fall semester achievement, attendance, and behavior outcomes."
