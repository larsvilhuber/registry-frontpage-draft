abstract: "This project sets out to add to the understanding on how managers make their hiring and wage setting decisions in German establishments. We start from the question to what extent wages and hiring decisions depend on believes about the return to individual characteristics, in particular the returns to four different types of human capital (general human capital as well as firm-, occupation-, and task-specific experience). 
To address the lack of exogenous variation in human capital measures in observational data, we design a conjoint survey experiment that creates random variation in the characteristics of potential hires. We then let actual decision makers in German establishments evaluate these randomly generated candidate profiles. The conjoint survey experiment is anchored in the BIBB Cost-Benefit Survey 2022/23. We randomly vary the gender and expected performance of the potential hires as well as their general human capital, occupational experience, firm-specific experience, and task-specific experience. Based on random variation in these individual characteristics, we assess the perceived return to these different types of individual-level human capital. 
Furthermore, we assess a range of personality traits of the respondents and plan to analyze the interaction between the decision makersâ€™ personality and their choices. Finally, we aim to link the data from our questionnaire to administrative linked employer-employee data from the German Institute for Employment Research (IAB). This link will allow us to quantify the contribution of (heterogeneity in) believes about the importance of different types of HC to overall wage inequality.
