abstract: "This project will investigate the dynamics of micro-entrepreneurs' expectations and business decisions. Like many other Sub-Saharan countries, the Tanzanian job market is very constrained, with few salaried jobs available. This is not improving: the youth's transition into formal salaried employment remains stagnant, mirroring the employment patterns of previous generations. At the same time, education access has developed widely. The young generation today can see that they have more education than their parent’s generation, while their exposure and knowledge of the job market are limited. 

In this context, young workers forced into self-employment might both aspire and expect to transition to a stable paid job. Such expectations are likely to divert resources and efforts from business development toward job search. 
    
The first goal of this project is to identify and measure the potential over-optimism of micro-entrepreneurs about their likelihood of transitioning into a salaried position. Then, using a lab-in-the-field information treatment, I will causally estimate the effect of accurate information on beliefs updating, business investments and job search, business outcomes and job finding.
