abstract: "We are interested in understanding recruiters’ practices in online job vacancy posting. We will examine what factors influence recruiters’ decisions regarding whether and how to advertise compensation. Using randomized information treatments, we will study how knowledge of the prevalence and recruitment impacts of different wage posting and wage setting practices affects the probability that recruiters post compensation-related information and their wage setting strategies."
