abstract: "Yields in aquaculture farming (aquafarming) vary substantially across regions and remain comparatively low in many African countries. Why this is the case is not fully understood. The premise this project is that low yields can, at least to some extent, be attributed to poor water quality. That this is a reasonable idea is supported by a large body of empirical research in various disciplines. The main hypothesis of the project is that small investments in training and technology can result in lasting and non-negligible positive effects on water quality, and consequently higher yields. To test this hypothesis, we carry out a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The setting is aquafarming in Nigeria, and the RCT will enable us to estimate the causal effects of access to training and access to a toolkit for water quality monitoring on water quality and farming outcomes. The design of the RCT will be two-armed, where the control group and the treatment groups are randomly recruited from a pool of approximately 600 (aquafarmers) based in the area Ekpan, Warri Delta State, Nigeria. The treatment group will be offered 2-3 days of training on how to assess and improve water quality, focusing on acidity and oxygen levels in particular. The training is carried out by staff at the Institute of Aquaculture Development Nigeria. The treatment group will also receive information about the quality of the water in their ponds. This information will be provided by field workers who will use a water quality control kit to obtain measures of water quality with respect to pH and oxygen level on a regular basis. All subjects will be interviewed in a baseline survey and revisited twice with 6-7 months intervals (the average rotation period of fish in the ponds). The program is implemented in partnership with University of Nigeria and Environment for Development, University of Gothenburg."
