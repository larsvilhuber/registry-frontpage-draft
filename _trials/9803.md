abstract: "Teachers in developing countries are routinely faced with multiple external constraints at work. They teach classrooms in resource-poor settings where the majority of students are first-generation learners with cumulative learning deficits. The presence of many potentially binding external constraints might suggest to teachers that their effort matters little in influencing student learning, leading to a perception of low returns to effort. These beliefs may predispose teachers to lower levels of perceived control over education production, translating into low levels of classroom effort, especially for lower-performing students in the classroom. I conduct an experimental evaluation of a psychosocial intervention that targets teachers’ beliefs about perceived returns to effort and study the extent to which it shifts teacher beliefs, affects teacher effort and student learning. I devise a novel experimental task to elicit teachers’ perceived control beliefs about improving performance of students in the bottom tail of ability distribution"
