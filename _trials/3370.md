abstract: "This paper proposes an experimental approach to incentivize children to make healthier food choices at school. We align childrenâ€™s appraisal of food choices with their appraisal of schoolwork by introducing a system in which food items are graded based on their nutritional value. We also involve parents and classmates as change agents, providing them with information regarding the food choices of their children/friends. "
