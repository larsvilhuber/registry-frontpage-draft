abstract: "We plan to administer a survey that elicits students' willingness to pay to learn their performance rank on a midterm. We plan to do this in a large microeconomics course. We then plan to randomly assign students to two conditions; one will receive access to a practice final exam and; another will receive access to the same exam but will be informed they will receive a message indicating where they ranked on the practice final."
