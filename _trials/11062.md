abstract: "We conduct a large-scale representative online survey in Germany to analyze what survey participants know about the German wealth distribution and their position in it, how preferences for redistribution of wealth are affected by an information treatment and what role the characteristics of the potential taxpayer play for the preferences for redistribution. 
To answer these questions, we implement an information provision experiment and a vignette study. Participants are randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups, a control group or the vignette group. The first treatment group receives information about the actual shape of the German wealth distribution using histograms and the second treatment group gets informed about their individual position in the wealth distribution. Our outcomes capture wealth inequality aversion, preferences for redistribution of wealth, equality of opportunity and the introduction of a specific yearly wealth tax. Additionally, the vignette group states their support for a one-off wealth tax."
