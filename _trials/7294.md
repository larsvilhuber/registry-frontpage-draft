abstract: "We conduct a pilot run of a virtual job fair in Bangladesh. The fair is organized for recent graduates from a large public agricultural university and participated by agro-industry firms. During the fair, each participating firm holds a live video session in which the firm explains its business and job openings and answers questions from participating jobseekers. Job applications and interviews are made through the online platform of the fair. This RCT adopts an oversubscription design: we first ask graduates if they are interested in the fair and then randomly select a half of the interested graduates to invite to the fair. We collect baseline and follow-up survey data of the college graduates to estimate the impacts of the fair on their employment outcomes."
