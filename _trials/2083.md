abstract: "Cities in developing countries increasingly face severe and apparently intractable traffic congestion. Congestion charges that discourage driving at peak hours and in congested areas are theoretically appealing. However, we know very little about how they work in practice. This experiment tests the impact of time-based (peak-hour) and area-based congestion charges on travel behavior, for a sample of car and motorcycle drivers in Bangalore. GPS enabled smartphones are used to collect travel behavior data, to communicate with respondents, and to implement the congestion charges.
