abstract: "Inadequately disposed waste is ubiquitous in low- and middle income countries, and causes serious environmental and health-related problems. In El Salvador, where streets and public spaces are typically highly contaminated by waste, littering poses a serious public goods problem at the community level. While the standard solution for public goods problems calls for an intervention by an external actor such as the state, a recent strand of literature has studied community driven development (CDD) as a potential alternative. Several studies have experimentally evaluated CDD initiatives, but their effectiveness has never been compared with that of the traditional non-participatory approach. 
We will conduct a randomized controlled trial with 120 communities in El Salvador to address that question in the context of the littering problem. Communities will be assigned to either a control group or to one out of two treatments: (1) a top-down intervention where the streets will be cleaned by an external actor, or (2) a bottom-up intervention were a community facilitator is hired to raise awareness and to mobilize for collective clean-ups and a change in social norms regarding littering. 
In all communities, we will conduct two types of measurements: (1) photos along the streets that will be evaluated using deep learning, (2) a short survey with a sample of 20 community members We will estimate both the immediate impact and the sustainability of the two interventions."
