abstract: "This pre-analysis plan describes a global study investigating the externalities created by unfairness and inequality, and individuals' beliefs about these effects. The study employs a novel experimental design to isolate and identify the impacts of unfairness and inequality on decision-making and beliefs. We will study how these treatments affect 40,000 participants in 40 countries. "
