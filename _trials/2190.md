abstract: "Interventions that encourage healthy eating are becoming widespread across the world as a way to combat the obesity epidemic. An increasingly prevalent intervention is the use of nudges, which attempt to change behavior without restricting the individualâ€™s choice. However, even if the nudge is successful at encouraging healthy eating, it is unknown whether the nudge is welfare increasing or welfare reducing for the individual. To answer this question, we develop a structural model and conduct a door-to-door food delivery field experiment where we randomize whether 1) individuals receive a calorie-and- nutrition information nudge and 2) whether we offer the food immediately or with a delay. To parse out welfare effects, we allow some individuals to sort in or out of the nudge by providing a pre-announcement flyer. This design allows us to measure the welfare effects of the nudge, and whether these effects interact with present bias when delivery of the food is immediate versus when it is delayed."
