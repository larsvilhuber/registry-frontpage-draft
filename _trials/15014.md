abstract: "Building on a test of how individuals anticipate and account for selection of others into sharing information, we run a pilot to investigate the role of complexity. By changing the distribution of private signals, we make it "obvious" how individuals with strong signals should act and so want to compare the resulting general behavior in this "simple" setting in comparison to the previous more "complex" setting."
