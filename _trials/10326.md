abstract: "Skills signaling seems to remain one of the most important factors in order to breach the gap between prospective workers and employers. At the same time, expecting an evaluation can change the performance of employees at the workplace. In a setup with more than 2000 unemployed youngsters at risk, going through a vocational training in the Dominican Republic, we test how giving a random subset of them a notice that they will receive a recommendation letter at the end of their internship affects their effort and motivation at the workplace. We also analyze long term results (1 year after vocational training) in employment and other labor-related outcomes, and how having the reference letter from a previous employer can affect labor search prospectives in high informality environments.
