abstract: "Arsenic consumption can lead to fatal health and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Children are more susceptible to arsenic because of their lower immunity and relatively higher proportion of body water compared to adults. Moreover, evidence suggests that arsenic crosses the placenta and adversely impacts health in utero. We aim to understand the constraints households face in accessing arsenic free water; is it the lack of information on water quality and its adverse health implications or the transaction costs associated with accessing water from an arsenic-free alternative water scheme. The intervention will be administered in one of the most contaminated regions of India, in Jorhat district of Assam to households with women of childbearing age, pregnant women and/or with young children.
