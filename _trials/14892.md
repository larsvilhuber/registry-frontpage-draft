abstract: "This study investigates the role of citizenship in mitigating labor market discrimination against first- and second-generation immigrants in France. Using a large-scale correspondence experiment with 6400 fictitious job applications, we aim to understand the extent to which hiring discrimination is related to immigrant status and ethnic origin, and the role that citizenship acquisition plays in mitigating this discrimination. The findings will provide insights into employer discriminatory behavior, informing policies to reduce discrimination and promote ethnic minorities and immigrant integration in labor markets."
