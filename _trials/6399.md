abstract: "In this paper I use an information provision experiment conducted about a vote on Nevadaâ€™s Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) to understand how voter beliefs inform support for price versus performance-based policies. By modeling how voter's perception of policy attributes (cost, effectiveness, and equity) map to voting behavior, I will be able to decompose differences in policy support into mutable misperceptions of policy attributes versus differential aversion to certain policies (i.e., a general distaste for tax-based policy). These results have important implications for designing politically feasible corrective policies.
