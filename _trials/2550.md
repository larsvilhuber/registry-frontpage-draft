abstract: "According to recent studies, the mobile internet in Kenya is among the fastest globally. There is an assumption that high-speed Internet has an impact on people’s lives as new Internet users have access to a vast amount of resources and can improve their own skills, employability and access to jobs. However, there is no research that illustrates the impacts of mobile Internet access. The purpose of the study is to understand how access to the Internet affects people’s lives. This project will study how access to data-enabled phones provide access to high speed mobile internet for people and how this affects peoples’ social and economic lives, whether they are able to search for job opportunities, learn skills, etc. over the internet.
