abstract: "Biased responses in survey studies could seriously harm and mislead our economic decision-making. In this study, we test the efficacy of an alternative bias-mitigating strategy, named the C-BTS. We implement three proof-of-concept experiments; First, as direct evidence of the efficacy of the C-BTS, we replicate the context of a previous study, Barrage and Lee (2010). Second, we check the efficacy of the C-BTS in eliciting the willingness-to-accept (WTA) for not using each of two popular social media apps, Facebook and Instagram for one week, using binary choices. Third, we also check the efficacy of the C-BTS in eliciting the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for keep using each of six social media apps, using the best-worst scaling format. Finally, by applying the C-BTS, we try to measure the consumer value of 12 popular AI-powered services in daily life."
