abstract: "to find spatial intelligence in children by using activity of word search.The Multiple Intelligence (MI) Theory is highly applicable and appreciated in modern education due to its main claim that every individual has eight intelligences and they all work together in a unique way. It was proposed by Howard Gardner in his book "Frames of Mind", and subsequently developed by his team at Harvard University through Project Zero (Gardner, 1983). He offered a unique concept on intelligence and had a pluralistic view of mind which recognizes many different sides of cognition and cognitive styles, since people have different cognitive strengths (Gardner & Moran, 2006). The theory can alter our perception of learning, since everybody owns all intelligences, but they are not developed equally (Waterhouse, 2006). 
The definition of intelligence by Gardner is different in comparison with its more conventional usage, when it generally refers to an individual´s IQ (measurable on a Simon-Binet scale) or "g" meaning "general intelligence" as proposed by Charles Spearman in 1927. In MI Theory intelligences can be associated with an individual´s aptitude or potentials - the fact that an individual is either high or low in one specific area does not make him any more or less intelligent in the traditional sense.
