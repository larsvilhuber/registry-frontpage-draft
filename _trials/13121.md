abstract: "In the experiment, we study the impact of providing farmers with vouchers to access services from Land Rental Service Providers (LRSPs), who can facilitate land rentals by matching landlords and tenants, supporting price negotiations, formalizing contracts, and assisting in case of disputes. We randomize vouchers for LRSPs across 235 kebelles (the smallest administrative unit), targeting households that have expressed an interest for this service in the initial listing exercise. First, we examine the impact of the voucher on household participation in rental markets. We then examine treatment effects on household outcomes, including agricultural production, non-agricultural activities, food security, and wealth."
