abstract: "The unprecedented scale of the COVID-19 crisis has revived support to groundbreaking fiscal options, including monetary financing, via the metaphor of the “helicopter money”. While this option may appear as a lesser evil at a first glance, economists widely agree that money creation, especially if repeatedly used, entails potentially large economic and political risks. Where do citizens stand? Would a one-time use of money printing open up the Pandora’s box and develop unrealistic expectations among citizens? Or can targeted communication manage their expectations? This project aims to conduct experiments within a large-scale survey with two main goals. First, we aim to measure what lay people really know and understand about public finances via the construction of a fiscal literacy score. Second, we aim to study how the public learns from various presentations of governmental funding options.
