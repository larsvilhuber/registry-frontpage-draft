abstract: "We test whether charitable offers within bargaining situations crowd out voluntary donations to charity. Inspired by bundles of private
and public goods in the marketplace, we implement variants of ultimatum games that allow for voluntary donations after the initial offer has been accepted. We test whether the option of linking charitable donations to offers in the bargaining situation increase the final provision of the public good. A special focus of the analyses will lie on gender differences as men and women were found to respond differently to social information in previous research.
