abstract: "The economic and political tensions between US and China have been rising since the Trump administration. Against such a backdrop, the national security concern that was once put aside has returned to the center stage of the US' economic statecraft and made the US economy decouple from China a reasonable strategic solution to reducing the economic dependence on the Chinese economy and supply chain. However, the US-China decoupling may undermine not only the US' and China's economic growth, but also the economic development of other countries, such as Taiwan, which is highly dependent on the US and China in economic terms. To study the role of Taiwan and Taiwanese people's perceptions of decoupling, this project investigates the issues through the lens of motivated reasoning. Particularly, we would like to focus on the views of both the economic elites and ordinary people in Taiwan on the decoupling between the US and China. Moreover, we will investigate how the decoupling concern affects the Taiwanese economic elites' and ordinary people' attitudes toward the US and China.
