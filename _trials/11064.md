abstract: "This pre-registration describes two different but related experiments: Explicit Randomization and Implicit Randomization. They will be run as treatments of a larger experiment and analyzed both individually and in comparison to each other. The experiments study the link between regret-avoidance and explicit/implicit randomization behavior in decision making under risk. We describe the experimental design, the hypotheses, planned analyses, and the sample size."
