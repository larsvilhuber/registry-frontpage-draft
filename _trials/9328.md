abstract: "School closures and learning disruptions carry high social and economic costs. Evidence suggests that events, such as terrorist attacks and wars, natural disasters, and pandemics, can trigger or deepen the presence of stressors within homes and ultimately impact childrenâ€™s development, learning, and protection. In the current context of a security emergency in Ukraine in which children have been forced to displace, tech-enabled tutoring has enormous potential for facilitating learning recovery and supporting the educational re-engagement of millions of students in a fragile context. Thus, in this project we conduct an impact evaluation on the Teach for Ukraine (TFU) tutoring program. It consists of a 2-week intervention that provides learning and socio-emotional support to Ukrainian students of 5-11 grades who are deprived of access to local educational services due to the war. To guarantee scalability and since it will be a complementary program to the normal school schedule once schools reopen, the program is scheduled to offer 3 sessions (1.5 hours each) per week. The learning component includes subject-specific academic content in accordance with Ukrainian educational programs. The socio-emotional component includes activities oriented to support students' social and emotional well-being. The total scheduled time for psychosocial support activities is 30 mins per session. In this project, we will evaluate the impact of the TFU tutoring program on the learning and socioemotional outcomes of adolescents. "
