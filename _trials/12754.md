abstract: "Introducing a new curriculum or program often raises a lot of questions. Whether it is a new reading curriculum in New York City or tutoring programs throughout the country to accelerate student learning post-COVID, principals and teachers may resist uprooting old practices and procedures. Most individuals are skeptical of something new even if there is evidence supporting its effectiveness. Thus, there is a need to complement evidence-based solutions with rigorous and research-based policies and procedures to scale a solution within a district.      

The Model of Reading Engagement (MORE) equips teachers with standards-aligned and evidence-based tools – lessons, digital activities, and formative assessments of transfer – designed to boost students’ reading comprehension and literacy skills through science and social studies units. In addition, MORE supplies districts with a set of scaling tools to advance equitable access to MORE across the district. These tools focus on three levers of change involving (1) the Summer Leadership Institute (SLI) to train select district leaders and teachers, (2) a district-wide communication and implementation plan developed by district learning communities, and (3) MORE Teacher Innovators (TIs) to implement MORE principles outside of the lesson time, which collectively help build district capacity and buy-in at multiple levels of the system. During the school year the MORE team also provides professional learning and support to suggest adjustments to the communication plan, as needed, and provide feedback to TIs on adaptations.  

Our study will assess the implementation and impact of the district-wide communication element of the of the scaling strategy. We will randomize the timing of messages sent to teacher and analyze secondary aggregate classroom data to assess implementation and impact based upon the content of the messages. While these principles that support the tools were developed with the MORE program in mind, many of these strategies could be applied in other contexts."
