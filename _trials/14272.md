abstract: "Television is a powerful tool to scale ‘edutainment’ - information that is both educational and entertaining. One such form of information is agricultural information, but there is limited rigorous evidence on the effect of extension delivered via television on agricultural outcomes, such as investment or productivity. We will evaluate a new farm makeover show broadcast on national TV in Zambia called “Munda Make Over," modeled after the popular Kenyan show “Shamba Shape Up”. The show is similar to home makeover shows in developed countries, featuring visits by an expert who tours the farm, points out areas for improvement, and implements their advice, with segments dedicated to gender issues interspersed throughout the season.
