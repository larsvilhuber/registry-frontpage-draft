abstract: "There is increasing evidence that children's social and emotional health and associated skills and mindsets are
strongly related to better education and labor market outcomes in adulthood (Deming 2017, Jackson et al., 2020).
Given this evidence, supporting students' emotional regulation, self-efficacy, and social skills are priorities for
many education systems and an essential component of recovery activities after the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet,
how best to develop these skills through existing education systems is an open policy question. In partnership with
the Puerto Rico Department of Education, this project seeks to evaluate a teacher professional development
program focused on improving teachers' and students' social and emotional well-being and associated skills. The
project has two goals. First, employing a sample of 600 primary schools, it will experimentally evaluate the
effectiveness of this program on teachers' and students' socio-emotional outcomes and students' academic
performance. Second, it will generate evidence on the potential effectiveness and costs of non-financial incentives that could  
increase teacher completion rates of these programs. "
