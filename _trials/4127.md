Arm 1. Raw Data-- raw data (historical infestation, participation in insecticide application campaigns) will be presented to searchers.  
Arm 2. Risk Map (Vectorpoint) and incentives for spatial coverage and visit to higher risk households. 
Arm 3. Optimization -- households are identified, including alternatives, and assigned to searchers"
