abstract: "We study whether schools discriminate against nontraditional (i.e., married) parents using a matched-pair correspondence study in Colombia. We will send fictitious requests to visit schools as a first step towards registering a first grader, randomly varying the household structure of the child: whether the parents are married, divorced, or there is a single parent. We plan to analyze differences in response rates across parents, and the response time conditional on receiving a response."
