abstract: "Companies implement different business ethics programs like codes of conduct, training, hotlines, and others, to enhance the conduct of its stakeholders, mainly of its employees. But we donÂ´t know how effective those programs are. RCTs may be a useful tool to learn about the effectiveness of ethics programs in organizations. 
We will evaluate the impact of the communication of a Mexican company's values code among its employees. We will randomize the treatment using the company's different branches as the level of randomization."
