abstract: "This project studies the implementation of an on-demand tutoring program in secondary schools in a charter school district in California (N=6,999). All 6th-12th grade students had access to 24/7 tutoring support during Spring 2021. We conduct a randomized controlled trial testing a personalized messaging intervention to increase student usage (N=4,763). Students are randomly assigned to a messaging condition targeting: (1) Students Only, (2) Parents Only, (3) Students+Parents, or (4) a control group. The three treatment conditions encourage usage of the tutoring program via mailers, emails, and text messages. Our primary outcome is whether students take-up tutoring (i.e., log-on and request help from a tutor)."
