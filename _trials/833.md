abstract: "To ensure that businesses pay the correct amount of tax, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) may contact businesses if a transaction varies considerably from normal business activity. Businesses may receive a personalized letter from the ATO asking them to review the amounts on their business activity statement and to get back to the ATO if an error occurred. The aim of this trial is to test the effect of changes to letters on response rates of taxpayers, the timing of payments and the amount of payments of liabilities. The interventions are: (1) changing due dates, (2) addressing social norms, (3) using a different color and (4) informing taxpayers about tax deductible donations. The ATO sent out 3,000 letters on 12 November 2015. 600 letters were sent to each of the four randomly selected treatment groups; the remaining 600 letters were sent to the control group."
