abstract: "This trial evaluates a policy package that was applied to early childhood centers in Panama. The package that all treatment centers received included teacher training sessions, educational materials, a monthly money transfer for the center, and close monitoring and help from the central authority. The package also includes important improvements in infrastructure.

For evaluation purposes, we randomized the order in which 89 child care centers administered by the government will receive the intervention. This will allow us to identify the impacts of the intervention on the centers. We are interested in how the policy affected the quality of classroom interactions, especially given that the literature shows that it is not easy to make improvements in this important outcome. Other potential outcomes of interest are the levels of attendance to the center and measures of structural quality."
