abstract: "The beneficial impact of tree rejuvenation on yields is well established in the agronomic literature. Practitioners seem to recognize that the real challenge – particularly in the East African context – is to increase the adoption of rejuvenation practices, as those often entail significant upfront costs and foregone incomes, for rewards that kick in only in the future. This is a problem faced in many other contexts in which poor farmers are supposed to undertake costly investment to increase adaptation and resilience to climate change. In partnership with a leading coffee exporter, we design, implement, and evaluate the impact of incentive schemes and a digital information intervention on tree stumping behaviour by farmers in the Rwanda coffee chain. We embed financial incentive schemes within pre-existing sourcing relationships between our partner and coffee farmers in Rwanda."
