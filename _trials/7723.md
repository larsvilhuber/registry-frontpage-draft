abstract: "We designed a randomized field experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of feedback provision to promote recycling. We can observe individual real-time data on bio-waste recycling thanks to the introduction of a system of electronic bins in a Spanish densely populated city. We exploit these data to evaluate the impact of providing information about household recycling performance on the incentives to participate in recycling programs. The field intervention is implemented by a team of environmental educators who has direct interaction with citizens.

In the control group, the subjects receive only one piece of information: A reminder about the recycling program. In the treatment group, the subjects receive two pieces of information: the reminder about the recycling program (as in the control group)  and a report of the recycling performance of the household. In this way, one group receives information about its own recycling performance and the other does not. "
