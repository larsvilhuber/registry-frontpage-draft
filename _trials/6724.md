abstract: "Information campaigns are a widely used policy tool to overcome problems arising from imperfect information. This study evaluates an intervention that randomized information letters about the savings potentials of energy efficient investments and behaviors among 120,000 households of two utilities in Germany. Moreover, we test whether the framing of information in environmental or monetary terms matters."
