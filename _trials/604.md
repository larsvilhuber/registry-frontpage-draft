abstract: "The aim of this study is to explore different modes of offering hospitalization and disability insurance to rural community members. We will explore peer effects, moral hazard, adverse selection and other asymmetric information problems and how they can be mitigated. We aim at developing improved health and disability insurance solutions that can effectively reduce household risk, while at the same time being financially sustainable. "
