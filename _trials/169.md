abstract: "The intervention aims to promote early childhood development and maternal-child interactions in a very poor urban environment.
The importance of the first 5 years of life for long-term development is well-established. During this vital period the development of children living in poverty is hindered by malnutrition, illness and unstimulating home environments. Evidence shows that interventions in early childhood can be very important for pshychosocial development. We will implement and evaluate a cost effective intervention, delivered by local women through weekly home visits during 18 months and targeted at children 10 â€“ 20 months and their mothers/primary caregivers. Evaluation will be by cluster randomised controlled trial. We will assess child development and conduct household and slum surveys before and after the intervention on a sample of n=400 children in 54 slums in Cuttack, Odisha, India.
