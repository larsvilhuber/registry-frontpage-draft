abstract: "MDRC, in partnership with MEF Associates and Abt Associates, is conducting an evaluation of Addiction Recovery Care (ARC), as part of broader study called Building Evidence on Employment Strategies (BEES). BEES is funded by Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation within the Administration for Children and Families at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. ARC is an organization headquartered in Louisa, Kentucky that serves adults with a broad range of substance abuse disorders. The program model combines substance use disorder recovery services with workforce development. The evaluation is using a randomized controlled trial to understand how access to ARC services affects outcomes related to employment, earnings, recovery, and housing. Individuals eligible for and interested in receiving ARC services are assigned at random to a treatment group, who is offered employment services, treatment for substance use disorders, substance-free housing, and case management services, or to a control group, who are referred to outpatient treatment either at ARC or elsewhere and have access to other employment and education services in the community. The goal is to enroll 800 individuals in the study. Outcomes will be measured over an 18-month follow-up period. The main outcomes to be measured are total earnings during the follow-up period, number of quarters employed during the follow-up period, a composite score for alcohol and drug use, and stability of housing during the follow-up period.
