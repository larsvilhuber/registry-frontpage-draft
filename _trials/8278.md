abstract: "Why do firms in low-income countries grow slowly? My research will provide new evidence on demand-side constraints, that is the challenges that firms face in building a customer base. Specifically, I will study how asymmetric information on product quality limits the ability of high-quality firms to attract customers. Accessing new customers may be especially difficult in developing countries due to high search costs that limit quality observability ex-ante (search frictions) and the lack of institutions that can enforce quality standards ex-post (contracting frictions). In this study, I will explore the role of these two frictions in limiting firm access to demand. To do that, I will combine data from a matched firm-customer survey with lab-in-the-field experiments to measure quality dispersion and asymmetric information in a number of small manufacturing sectors in Kampala, Uganda. I will then use this data to estimate a structural model of search with unknown quality and perform counterfactual analysis to quantify the relative importance of search and contracting frictions on firm and employment growth, entry/exit dynamic, and the distribution of quality. The structural approach of this study allows examining the mechanisms through which policies aimed at reducing asymmetric information on product quality may affect market outcomes in a general equilibrium framework. This can be informative of the type of interventions that would be most effective at stimulating firm expansion and the generation of employment in low-income economies."
