abstract: "In the Netherlands the ineffectiveness of labor market reintegration policies within unemployment insurance and social welfare has led 6 Dutch municipalities (Tilburg, Wageningen, Groningen, Utrecht, Nijmegen and Deventer) to run RCT field experiments to test out new ways of implementing reintegration and income support policies. Among them is the city of Tilburg in which the local government in collaboration with societal organisations of social work and societal support have taken up the initiative already in 2015 to start the so-called Tilburg Trust Experiment.  The RCT experiment got the approval of the Dutch Government which is required under the terms of the Participation Law (article 83)  and eventually started in October 2017. The Tilburg experiment includes around 800 social assistance recipients. For the 2-year duration of the trial, the persons voluntarily participating in the experiment are randomly assigned to four treatment groups: 1: an exemption or self-management group  combined with an additional work bonus for people entering fulltime work (earnings release), 2: a coaching group in which the persons get intensive supervision oriented at reinsertion into work also combined with an additional work bonus, 3: an intensive mediation group without earnings release, and eventually 4: a standard group for which nothing changed (they get the regular treatment). For methodological reasons  a reference group is added as a fifth group to be able to compare the outcomes of the various treatments with the outcomes for people having any involvement in the experiment. The study is set up as a randomised controlled trial (RCT) with interventions running from half December 2017 to October, 1 in 2019. The primary outcome measure according to article 83 of the Participation Law is full-time reintegration into paid work. But the terms of law also mention secondary outcomes such as improvements in health and wellbeing, self-management capacities of people on social assistance, social participation and reduction of financial stress."
