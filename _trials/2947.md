abstract: "Research indicates that children need to develop math skills in preschool and the first years of their primary education to build a foundation for future mathematics learning. This project is a randomized control trial of mathematics in pre-school and the first years of primary education implemented in Cordillera, Paraguay. In a context of significant gaps in teacher preparation and pedagogy, the program uses interactive audio segments that cover the entire math curriculum for the respective grade. Since Paraguayan classrooms tend to be bilingual, the audio and written materials use a combination of Spanish and Guarani. Based on an experimental evaluation since the program's implementation, we document positive and significant improvements in children's mathematics scores. The program helped narrow learning gaps between low- and high-performing students, and between students with trained teachers and those whose teachers lack formal training in early childhood education. Moreover, the program improved learning equally among both Guarani and Spanish-speaking students. "
