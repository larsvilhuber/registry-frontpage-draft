abstract: "As the impact of standard business training is not large, an alternative is needed to boost the productivity of small and medium enterprises in developing countries. One of the alternative approaches is the bottom-up and participatory Kaizen. A recent review of business training by VoxDev (Training Entrepreneurs: Issue 3, published in 2023) hints at the effectiveness of the Kaizen approach. In this study, we conduct a 2x2 RCT to examine the relative impact of the two approaches and their complementarity. By collecting data from managers and workers, we will evaluate impacts on firms as well as on their workers since the participatory Kaizen approach is expected to have an impact on the working environment and workers' retention and satisfaction.
