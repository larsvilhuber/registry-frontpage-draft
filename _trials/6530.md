abstract: "We leverage a field experiment across three distinct school districts to identify key pieces of a structural model of adolescent human capital production.  Our focus is inspired by the contemporary psychology of education literature, which expresses learning as a function of the ratio of the time spent on learning to the time needed to learn.  By capturing two crucial student-level unobservables---which we denote as academic efficiency (turning inputs into outputs) and time preference (motivation)---our field experiment lends insights into the underpinnings of adolescent skill formation and provides a novel view of how to lessen racial and gender achievement gaps.
