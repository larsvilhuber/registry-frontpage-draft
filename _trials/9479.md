abstract: "We examine peer effects in the formation of macroeconomic expectations. We design a large-scale international survey among 1500 experts working in 130 countries, asking about their expectations about inflation rates for the years 2022 (short-term expectations), 2023 (mid-term expectations), and 2026 (long-term expectations).
