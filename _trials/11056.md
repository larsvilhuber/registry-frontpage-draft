abstract: "What is the relationship between employment and gender identity? We study this question in the context of the Rohingya refugee camps, the largest refugee camps in the world, and a setting in which pervasive unemployment and strong gender norms mark daily refugee experience. We involve 2520 individuals in a field experiment with four arms: a control arm, a weekly cash arm, and an employment
arm of equal value, and a volunteering arm. We explore how each of these interventions ultimately affects psycho-social wellbeing through their impacts on individuals' engagement of self (self worth, purpose), engagement with their partner (intra-household decision making, bargaining and intimate partner violence), and engagement with the outside world (sociability). By disentangling the key components of employment into receiving an income, performing a productive activity, and receiving an income for performing a productive activity, we are able to map the various dimensions of employment to distinct policy interventions, each with potentially distinct returns for males and females in our context.
