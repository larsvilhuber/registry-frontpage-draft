abstract: "There is evidence that women who own and operate small and medium enterprises receive relatively less bank financing in many emerging markets, including Vietnam. In this study we consider and test the impact of bonus incentives to a bank's existing clients to refer new women owned and operated small and medium enterprises (WSMEs) as clients, and crossing incentives to the referred WSMEs."
