abstract: "A national football federation sends an email to coaches of amateur football clubs, pointing to the important role football plays in promoting inclusivity and reducing racism in society. The email also describes findings from earlier studies showing that discrimination is present in amateur football. Each amateur football club in the country is randomly assigned to either receiving the email or not. At most one coach per club is contacted. In the next stage of the experiment, fictitious applications will be sent to coaches asking if it is possible to join a training session. The applications, which are send by email, will differ only in the contact name (foreign- or native-sounding names). We study whether coaches who were sent the email from the national football federation respond differently to the email requests to join a training session as compared to coaches who were not sent the email from the national football federation. Our main prediction is that the email from the federation leads to an increase in positive responses to email requests to join a training session signed with a foreign name, whereas we expect no effects for email requests to join a training session signed with a native name. A positive response is defined as either an invitation to come to a training or a conditional acceptance (e.g. yes, you're welcome, but only if you are a player of a particular type, e.g. defender).
