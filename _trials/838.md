abstract: "The objective of this trial is to improve internal procedures and client engagement strategies of the Business Area "Employer Obligations" (EO) within the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). Employers in Australia have tax, superannuation, and other government obligations that vary depending on whether workers are employees or contractors. For employees, employers may have obligations for pay-as-you-go (PAYG) withholding, superannuation, and fringe benefits tax. For contractors, employers may have superannuation obligations. In addition to these obligations, employers may have to meet other federal, state and territory obligations (such as occupational health and safety requirements). 

This trial consists of two parts. The first part of the trial aims to assess the effect of changing internal procedures (by adopting the procedures of a different ATO Business Area, "Indirect Tax" (ITX)) on the debt collection rate, the duration of case cycles, and the quality of the interactions between EO field auditors and their clients. The analysis is based on de-identified administrative data provided by the ATO and data obtained from a survey of field auditors at the beginning and the end of the trial. 

The second part of the trial intends to improve the interaction between EO desk auditors and their clients. The intervention focuses on studying the effect of changing the contents of letters that desk auditors send to their clients and the effect of changing the script that desk auditors use for phone conversations. The outcome measures are (1) the debt collection rate, (2) the propensity of clients to lodge their tax return, (3) the duration of case cycles, and (4) the quality of interaction between EO desk auditors and their clients (based on a survey of desk auditors at the beginning and the end of the trial).
