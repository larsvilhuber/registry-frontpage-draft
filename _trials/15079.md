abstract: "Pilot study on taxpayer education and property taxes conducted from August to November 2024 in an urban municipality in the Greater Accra Region, Ghana. The study encompasses two closely connected tax collection experiments. These two experiments build on a common intervention component: an in-depth education campaign on property taxation received by a subset of taxpayers and tax collectors, respectively. The educational program focuses on the institutional details of property taxes, the tax collection process, and rights and responsibilities of taxpayers. The first experiment creates exogenous pairings between tax collectors and taxpayers with differing combinations of education treatment status. The second experiment focuses on the tax collection process in equilibrium with experimental arms varying both the education status and the collector's salience of taxpayer education. We focus on three main outcomes: (i) immediate outcomes of the education program on knowledge, (ii) intermediate outcomes on collector-taxpayer interactions, (iii) and final outcomes on tax registration and payment. Different potential mechanisms will be considered."
