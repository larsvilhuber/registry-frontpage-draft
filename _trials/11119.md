abstract: "College students who perform poorly in the first half of a course are at a higher risk of continued poor performance for the remainder of the term. Therefore, a timely intervention by faculty may impact academic outcomes among low-performing students. This study examines the effectiveness of a mid-term meeting with faculty on academic outcomes and retention rates among low-performing students. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial among college students enrolled in introductory economics classes. Treated students will receive an email from their instructor encouraging them to meet and discuss their academic progress and ways to improve. We will estimate the intent-to-treat effect of the email intervention on academic outcomes and the average treatment effect of meeting on the treated using data on actual meetings. The results of this study could inform interventions to support the academic success and retention of low-performing college students."
