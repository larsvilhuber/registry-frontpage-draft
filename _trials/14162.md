abstract: "Air pollution is high but unevenly distributed within African cities. In principle, individuals could thus avoid severe health costs by working in the cleaner parts of the city. Yet, avoidance and in place adaptation depends on individuals' beliefs about the levels and spatial distribution of pollution. We conduct an information experiment to assess awareness of pollution and the scope for improved information to increase adaptation and avoidance.
