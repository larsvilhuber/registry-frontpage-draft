abstract: "In recent years, atheism has grown in popularity, partly inspired by the rise to prominence of a group of public intellectuals called the “New Atheists” who argue against religion in public fora. Does exposure to the concept of atheism affect religiosity? We test in a laboratory study in Kenya whether exposure to arguments of the style made by the “New Atheists” impact selfreported and implicit religiosity measures. The present documents outlines the analyses to be conducted to answer this question."
