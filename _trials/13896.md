abstract: "In a previous experimental study, we documented that social norms in discrimination games vary by social context. In particular, we show that participants rate in-group favouritism as more or less socially appropriate based on the social identity that is in play. Participants perceived it to be more socially inappropriate to discriminate on the basis of religious affiliation than on the basis of political identity. The study included also a behavioural task that showed an alignment between social norms and behaviours. Participants opted for decisions that favoured their in-groups more frequently in the social contexts where those decisions were regarded as more socially appropriate. This study was carried out in experimental laboratories in the UK and Spain between 2022 and 2023. 

Here, we present a vignette experiment to measure social norms on in-group favouritism and group behaviour across a wide range of social identities. Our hypothesis is that participants will rate in-group favouritism differently in different contexts of social identity. We will be able to rank identities based on the level of in-group favouritism considered appropriate in each context. That ranking will be influenced by the agency that individuals grant to other people over features of their identity.
