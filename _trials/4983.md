abstract: "Given the challenges of implementing a nationwide carbon tax policy or a cap-and-trade program in the United States, individuals, business entities, and non-profit organizations have explored other possibilities to lower their carbon emissions. For example, a new program called Restore California offers restaurants the opportunities to opt-in and add an optional percentage charge to every customer bill. The money gathered through the program will then go to farmers who practice sustainable farming that removes carbon from the atmosphere. The goal of this study is to assess the public’s willingness to pay to fund such programs to reduce food and agriculture carbon emissions. In particular, we explore how much people’s willingness to pay is to reduce carbon emission, measured as an optional surcharge of their restaurant check. "
