abstract: "Women's equality and empowerment is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), but also integral to all dimensions of inclusive and sustainable development. The social and structural hindrances faced by the women limit their economic participation, denying the communities from enjoying greater inclusive socio-economic growth. The lack of entrepreneurial skills has been identified as one of the main obstacles faced by potential women entrepreneurs, which is further exacerbated by limited access to trainings that enable the development of such skills in the rural areas. It has been reported that most training programs in rural areas are ineffective. Therefore, it is important to investigate whether we can design external mechanisms to incentivize them to apply the skills and knowledge from the trainings in their business. The main objective of this research is to encourage the adoption of knowledge and skills learned from the training programs through different incentive mechanisms. To pursue this objective, we compare participants' post-training adoption behavior in a baseline treatment with no incentive, to post-training adoption behavior in two different incentive treatments that are either gain-framed or loss-framed incentives.
