abstract: "Mobile financial services (MFS) have rapidly widespread in the developing world. They have reached many
previously unbanked people but also created opportunities for dishonest agents to overcharge vulnerable
population. This is hard to resolve both for MFS providers and regulators because it is too costly to monitor each
agent closely and because restricting agents’ behavior may drive away some unbanked clients or induce some
agents to switch to a different MFS provider. As a potentially cost-effective way to address this difficulty, we
explore a citizen science approach using high-frequency real-time crowdsourced data, gathered by youth
volunteers, to detect agents’ overcharging behaviour. An obvious concern about crowdsourced data is the data
quality because data could be added only by crowdsource app users and even faked. Hence, we plan to utilize
mystery shoppers to verify the reliability and accuracy of the crowdsourced data. We will also test the efficacy
of an incentive treatment, where treated volunteers will be provided with additional monetary incentives to recruit citizen scientists. This enables us to obtain evidence on whether providing incentives for signing up increases the total number of citizen scientists willing to contribute to the citizen science approach and if the citizen science approach can help detect overcharging and serve as a departure point for a future scale-up randomized study."
