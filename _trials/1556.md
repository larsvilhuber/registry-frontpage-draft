abstract: "Innovate UK started an Innovation Vouchers programme in 2012 to provide support SMEs for their innovation activities. The programme provides SMEs from all sectors financial support of up to £5000 (excluding VAT) for engaging the services of experts from academia, research and technology organisations or the private sector to pursue a certain innovative project within the firm. The programme was conducted in several rounds each year. The evaluation of the programme focuses on the three most recent rounds (Rounds 11-13).
 
The Innovation Vouchers programme operates as a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT), which is designed to evaluate causal evidence on the impact and effectiveness of the programme. 

In particular, the project team aims to answer the following key questions:
1) Do businesses that are given an Innovation Voucher have more collaboration with external partners than those not given one?
2) Do businesses that are given an Innovation Voucher have more innovation activities than those not given one?
3) Do businesses that are given an Innovation Voucher have a higher innovation output than those not given one?
4) Do businesses that are given an Innovation Voucher have better business performance indicators than those not given one?

Within the analysis, several outcome measures are taken into consideration in order to analyse the impact of the Innovation Vouchers programme.

Hyothesis 1: Innovation vouchers have a positive effect on a firm’s collaboration with external partners.
Primary indicator: Percent of innovation activities conducted with the help of external partners.

Hyothesis 2: Innovation vouchers have a positive effect on a firm’s innovation activities.
Primary indicator: Percent of firm's turnover spent on innovation.

Hyothesis 3: Innovation vouchers have a positive effect on a firm’s innovation output.
Primary indicator: Percent of turnover coming from new or improved products or services.

Hyothesis 4: Innovation vouchers have a positive effect on a firm’s business performance  indicators.
Primary indicator: Business turnover."
