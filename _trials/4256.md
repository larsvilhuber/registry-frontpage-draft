abstract: "We test the effect of providing publicly available information about the pecuniary and non-pecuniary returns to college students deciding their college major. More specifically, we send emails to over 10,000 UC Davis students with information about the ranking of college major categories by average earnings, relatedness of job to major and job satisfaction, randomly varying the information among participants. We plan to measure the effect of information on important education outcomes such as course-taking, grades, college major choice and graduation."
