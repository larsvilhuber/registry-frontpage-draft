abstract: "Despite its legacy of tracking, the modern German education system offers a multitude of transfer opportunities that allow students to switch school tracks before, during and after high school. However, these transfer opportunities are used seldomly, with initial tracking choices proving to be final for many students. In this project we test whether preferences for school track in Germany are affected by (incorrect) beliefs about upward mobility within the tracked system. To this end, we implement an online-survey experiment in a representative sample of adults. First, we elicit respondentsâ€™ beliefs about university graduation rates by school track in the German education system. Second, we provide a randomly selected treatment group with information on these graduation rates. This research design allows us to test whether respondents hold incorrect prior beliefs about the persistence of initial school track choice, and whether providing information challenging incorrect beliefs affects aspirations for academic track schools."
