abstract: "One popular policy approach to curbing deforestation is payments for ecosystem services (PES), where participants receive payments if they comply with a set of conditions that are protective of the environment, such as refraining from cutting down trees on their land. It is important to evaluate this and other types of emissions reduction interventions in order to determine the most cost-effective way of reducing carbon emissions. This project is based in the districts of Hoima and Kibaale, which are in the equatorial zone of western Uganda and have some of the highest deforestation rates in the country. The goal of this study is to estimate the effect of payments to landowners for forest conservation on landownersâ€™ social and economic welfare and the ecological integrity of the forest by randomly assigning 136 villages to either receive the PES program or act as the comparison group.
