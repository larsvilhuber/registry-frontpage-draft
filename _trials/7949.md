abstract: "The proposed project aims to understand whether language can causally affect people's attitudes towards private and public debt. We  investigate this question via an online survey experiment which will be fielded in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, as well as in three countries which have English as an official language (Australia, UK, US).
