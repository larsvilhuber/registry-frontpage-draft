abstract: "This trial studies the impact of four pre-departure interventions for migrant domestic workers from the Philippines. Interventions take place about two weeks before migrants depart for the destination country. The study is based on 2,000 female domestic workers bound for Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia.

First, the "gift and photo" intervention encourages migrants to introduce themselves to the employer with a small gift that we provide and to show a family picture. The intervention aims at improving the treatment of the domestic worker by her employer. 

Second, a short savings module and third, regular savings reminders aim at improving financial decision making and encourage migrants to save the targeted share of income. 

Fourth, an intervention where experienced domestic workers share their experiences, problems faced, and suggestions to overcome these problems aims at managing expectations, faster adjustment, and overall higher well-being."
