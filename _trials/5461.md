abstract: "We investigate if having a biased self-image affects how students take-up and process information that is in principle self-relevant. In particular, we aim to investigate if changing a studentâ€™s personal mindset (by allowing her to explore her own interests, and showing her that these interests can map into interesting careers), changes the way in which the student seeks and processes information about higher education (formal education and vocational training)."
