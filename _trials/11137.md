abstract: "In this research project, we investigate the role "selection by consistency" plays in unequal career outcomes in leadership positions, and how the selection process and outcomes are perceived in terms of fairness. To this end, we run both lab and survey experiments in an attempt to answer the questions: Who behaves consistently and why? How are the selection outcomes and the process perceived? In the lab experiment, we run a selection contest to examine whether competing leadership aspirants act consistently to signal their competency and whether selecting principals pick up on these signals by selecting the consistent candidates. In those treatments with a principal, agents can try to signal their ability by reporting consistent answers, while in the control treatments their best response is to be as accurate as possible. We collect multi-faceted information on individuals and their characteristics to identify the determinants of consistent behavior and to learn more about the outcomes of selection-by-consistency. To study the potential implications of the selection for the perceptions of inequality, we analyze fairness perceptions in an incentivized manner in a follow up experiment, which will be registered separately.
