abstract: "While public revenue is urgently needed in low-income countries, the welfare costs of taxation may be particularly high because of the variability of income, liquidity constraints and the lack of savings technologies. This project explores whether tax authorities in such settings can increase tax compliance while minimizing welfare losses by adapting tax administration to the existence of binding cash-on-hand constraints. In a randomized field experiment conducted in collaboration with the provincial tax authority of Kasa√Ø Central, we explore three interventions seeking to relax cash-on-hand constraints: (1) timing collector visits when households are unconstrained; (2) helping households plan and save up for tax payment; and (3) allowing households to pay in installments. Although the development literature has demonstrated the importance of liquidity constraints in economic decision-making, this project will be the first to bring this insight into the public finance of developing countries and experimentally assess policy tools capable of relaxing these constraints."
