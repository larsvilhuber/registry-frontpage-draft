abstract: "Recent research suggests that perspective-getting (i.e. listening to the personal narrative of another) when embedded in a bundled intervention improves feelings towards minoritized others and reduces exclusionary attitudes towards them in real world settings. These bundled interventions, however, contain other psychological components, such as creating an opportunity for introspection and sharing of one's own perspective or story or creating a non-judgmental environment for an exchange of perspectives, which could have an independent impact on feelings towards the other or on prejudicial attitudes. In the current study, we investigate the impact of three different stand-alone psychological interventions (perspective-getting; analogic perspective-taking, i.e. sharing one's own related experience or story to understand the perspective of the other; and, an exchange of reasons/perspectives in a non-judgmental environment) relative to a control group and to one another to understand the absolute and relative importance of narrative and of a non-judgmental exchange for prejudice reduction towards refugees. The setting for our study is Nairobi, Kenya. We examine the impact of these interventions on feelings and attitudes towards refugees as our primary outcomes of interest immediately after the intervention and 3 and 6 months from when the intervention is administered."
