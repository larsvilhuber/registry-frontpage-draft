abstract: "This study investigates the effects of providing idle youth in Ethiopia with psychological supports, more specifically self-affirmation and goal-setting, in terms of job search and employment outcomes. Out-of-work vulnerable youth between the age of 18 and 29 in Addis Ababa were invited to participate in the project and then randomly assigned to a control group or one of two treatment arms. For the first treatment,
they were invited to attend a behaviorally informed three-hour workshop focused on self-affirmation, while in the second treatment the workshop also included a goal-setting exercise. Fortnightly follow-up calls were made to all individuals for the subsequent three
months, collecting data on job search, employment and other outcomes. The present document outlines the outcomes and regression specifications to assess the short term effect of these workshops."
