abstract: "The Millennium Challenge Corporation sponsored the Rwanda Threshold Program (RTP) to help the Government of Rwanda improve its performance on governance indicators related to citizens’ political rights and civil liberties. Mathematica Policy Research conducted an evaluation of the RTP’s Strengthening Civic Participation (SCP) component, an initiative with two focus areas: (1) supporting the efforts of civil society organizations to advocate for local issues and (2) training local government officials to increase responsiveness to the concerns and priorities of citizens. The evaluation uses a stratified random assignment design, whereby districts within each of Rwanda’s five provinces were paired based on district population and economic characteristics and then randomly assigned to either a treatment or a control group. We designed a household survey to collect data for evaluating SCP impacts, and administered this survey at baseline before the program (in early 2011) and one year after the start of the program (2012). We drew nationally representative samples of approximately 10,000 households in each data collection round. The baseline and follow-up surveys collected data on respondents’ civic participation levels, including awareness and perceptions of local government performance, responsiveness, and accountability. Specifically, respondents were asked about their awareness of local government meetings, familiarity with local government officials, perceived citizen influence, and knowledge and access to information about local government affairs. Respondents were also asked about their overall satisfaction with government services related to water infrastructure, local road conditions, waste collection, public schools, and health clinics. We use this household survey data to analyze program impacts."
