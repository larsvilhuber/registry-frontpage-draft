abstract: "We plan to evaluate the causal impact of labor organizing on worker welfare and service quality in the health care sector. Existing observational evidence suggests that unionization leads to increased staff retention and productivity among health care workers leading, in turn, to both an increase in the quality of care and an improvement in cost-efficiency. In partnership with a union, we plan to randomize ongoing efforts to unionize facilities and implement mixed-methods data collection around these efforts to obtain randomization-based causal effects of labor organizing on labor market outcomes, such as wages, hours, and benefits, and outcomes related to care quality."
