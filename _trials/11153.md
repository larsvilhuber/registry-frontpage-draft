abstract: "Our study aims to investigate whether 'informational interventions' can help reduce anti-minority sentiments. Specifically, we will conduct an online survey in the Czech Republic. The Roma community in the Czech Republic continues to be one of the most marginalized and discriminated against groups worldwide.  Initially, we elicit people's attitudes towards the Roma community. Some participants are then shown a video portraying the fictional life story of a Roma girl, aimed at evoking compassion. Finally, we assess participants' willingness to support the Roma community using self-reported and behavioral measures."
