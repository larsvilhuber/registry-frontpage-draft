abstract: "Ample research documents the female founding gap, but we lack a thorough understanding of the reasons for this gap and of potential solutions to reduce it. We examine two main structural constraints that may prevent women from taking the first steps towards entrepreneurship: access to finance and access to a relevant network, and investigate to what extent these constraints play a role in the decision to enter entrepreneurship. We use a randomized recruitment campaign for an incubation program– a common first step towards entrepreneurship – to run a field experiment. Through the experiment, we test the impact of informational messaging treatments focused on getting access to finance vs. access to network on the decisions of women to apply for the program and complete it. In addition, we examine if this variation in messages results in different types of women applying for and completing the program. We expect findings from the experiment to uncover mechanisms that help explain the existence of a female founding gap at the entry stage and suggest remedies to it. A deeper understanding of the drivers behind the low rates of entry of female founders into entrepreneurship is not only important from a scholarly perspective, but it also has critical implications for policies and programs promoting entrepreneurship and the participation of historically underrepresented groups.
