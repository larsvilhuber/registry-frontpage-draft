abstract: "
Logical-mathematical intelligence is one of the traits of students that is crucial to learning mathematics. Because it can be incorporated into all mathematical disciplines, logical-mathematical intelligence is one of the most dominant elements of multiple intelligences in mathematics learning. The ability for children to understand words and numbers, to utilise logic and examine situations logically, to find formulae and conduct scientific studies is known as logical-mathematical intelligence. This study aims to describe the logical-mathematical skills of kids between the ages of 7-12. The goal of the study is to determine each indicator's unique logical-mathematical cognitive profile for students.
