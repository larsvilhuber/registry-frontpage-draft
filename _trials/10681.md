abstract: "We conducted four experiments on voter views within the 2022 Cooperative Election Study. All four experiments related to information provision, and respondents' views on police reform, support for various bills and reforms, partisan vote choice, views on parties' reform agendas, etc.

Note that the survey has already been conducted (via YouGov and the Cooperative Election Study team) at the time that we are submitting this pre-analysis plan, but we have not been provided any information, data, or results from the survey. "
