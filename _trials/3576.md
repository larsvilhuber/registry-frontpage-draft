abstract: "Conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs have spread worldwide. They are designed to provide additional income support to families, as well as to promote comprehensive human capital investments in children, starting from encouraging pre-natal and maternal care and early childhood health interventions and continuing through incentivizing school attendance. Yet, evaluating these claims over more than a few years is hard, as most CCT experiments extend the program to control locations after a short experimental period. This project experimentally estimates the impacts of Indonesiaâ€™s cash transfer program six years after the program launched, using data from about 14,000 households
in 360 sub-districts across Indonesia, taking advantage of the fact that treatment and control locations remained largely intact throughout the period."
