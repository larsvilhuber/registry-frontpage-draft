abstract: "Our study investigates how the integration of AI tools in educational contexts influences perceptions of fairness. Driven by ongoing discussions around the ethical implications of AI use by students, this research seeks to understand fairness perceptions across various settings, including competitive and non-competitive scenarios.
Utilizing a structured experimental design, participants are presented with situations involving two hypothetical students, one engaging with AI tools and the other not. The study examines how different conditions related to AI usage affect third-party perceptions of fairness and their decisions regarding score redistribution.
We explore several hypotheses regarding fairness perceptions, including the notion that AI use in competitive situations may be viewed as less equitable and that specific types of AI encouragement influence the desire for score adjustments. The findings aim to contribute to the understanding of fairness in the context of AI, with implications for educational practices.
