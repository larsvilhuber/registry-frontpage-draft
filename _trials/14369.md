abstract: "Procrastination is a common issue among students. My research explores procrastination as a self-defensive mechanism by integrating psychological insights with economic theory in a field experiment with college students. I test whether a low-cost intervention on self-esteem can reduce procrastination, and its impact on academic performance.

Specifically, my project is a field experiment with first year students at a public university in Switzerland. Procrastination will be measured using a learning platform, where professors upload questions for student engagement and assessment. Students will be randomly assigned to three groups, each receiving different interventions. The first group will set deadlines. The second group will receive a self-esteem booster with positive messages emphasizing progress in the platform. The third group serves as a control and will use the standard version of the platform. I will evaluate the impact of the interventions on procrastination. Additionally, I will use machine learning techniques to estimate treatment effect heterogeneity. Finally, I will estimate the effect of the interventions on academic performance.

I run a pilot study in Fall 2024 and plan to implement the main experiment in Fall 2025."
