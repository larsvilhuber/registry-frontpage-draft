abstract: "While urbanization can bring benefits for economic, cultural and societal development, a rapid pace of urbanization can create enormous challenges. Cities in low and middle-income countries in particular are struggling to keep up with necessary infrastructure investment. Urban slums are a result of the unprecedented rate of urbanization that is leading 40 per cent of the world’s urban population expansion to happen in areas with depressed private and public investment (Marx, Stoker, and Suri 2013).  The water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure in particular is stressed beyond current capacity. Given that recent evidence suggests that inadequate sanitation is particularly threatening to early-life health when coupled with high population density (Hathi et al. 2017), efforts to improve sanitary conditions in slums are therefore of direct policy relevance. 

It is generally accepted that public and community toilets  (CTs) will, for the foreseeable future, continue to be an important solution to improve sanitary conditions in slums, given numerous constraints to increasing access to safely-managed private toilets. The Joint Monitoring Program WHO-UNICEF has recently classified CTs in a higher step of the sanitation ladder than private on-site unimproved sanitation solutions (JMP WHO-UNICEF 2017). However, even where CTs are available, open defecation remains common behaviour among slum-dwellers. In India, CTs have been widely introduced in slums, but they are only used by 15% of slum-dwellers. Open defecation remains a common behaviour, practiced by more than half of Indian slum-dwellers without in-house sanitation facilities (Indian Ministry of Home Affairs 2011).

In this context our  study has three main objectives: 
i)	to document slum dwellers' the willingness to pay (WTP) for community toilets and its link with usage; 
ii)	to identify the impact of releasing supply-side or both supply-side and informational constraints on WTP and usage; 
iii)	to determine the time horizon of such impacts (short-term, longer-term, or both). 

To do so, we will implement a cluster-randomized design in 110 slums in the cities of Lucknow and Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, India. CTs and their catchment areas will be randomly allocated to either a supply-side intervention on its own or the supply-side intervention combined with information provision. Alongside this, we will measure WTP by offering survey respondents a bundle of tickets for using the CT closest to the household. 

Our specific research questions are:
•	What is slum-dwellers’ WTP for CT access? And does WTP affect CT usage (evidence of a screening effect)? 
•	Can the releasing of resource constraints and provision of financial incentives to caretakers improve quality of CTs?
•	Can slum-dwellers’ WTP for CTs and their usage be affected by promoting and ensuring such CT quality improvements?  
•	Is the effect of promoting CT quality improvements on WTP for and usage of CTs greater when also providing slum-dwellers with information about private and public risks of open defecation, as well as benefits of CTs and users’ duties and rights when paying the CT fee?
•	Do the interventions have longer-run effects on WTP and/or CT usage?
