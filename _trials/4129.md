abstract: "The goal of this study is to examine whether some the most well-known decision biases show up in strategic environments. The decision biases we explore are the attraction effect, the compromise effect and the duplication effect. These biases, that are part of a larger group of behavioral biases known as context effects, have been well-documented in individual decision making but received little attention in interactive environments. In a lab experiment, we design two-player games in which different strategies are added to one of the players' set of strategies. The player whose strategy set is manipulated is placed in a position where his strategic choice may reflect one of the above context effects. Using a between-subject analysis, we will examine these effects in two types of 2x2 simultaneous-move games: coordination games and games in which one player has a dominating strategy. We will measure the direct effect on the player whose strategy set is manipulated and also measure the indirect effect as reflected through the strategic choices of the opponent. In other words, we test not only whether players with the extended strategy set react to the context effects but also whether the players, who face those with the extended set, anticipate the behavioral bias and respond to it."
