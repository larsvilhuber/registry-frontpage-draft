abstract: "Cervical cancer is an important cause of mortality worldwide. The Papanicolaou (Pap) test reduces its incidence and mortality rates, but despite the supply of these services at no cost many women fail to take it. We designed a four-arm field experiment designed to increase the PAP screening in Uruguay. We aim to send 70,000 personalized text messages to 45,000 women over a 12-week period, targeting malleable factors that potentially drive low screening rates. Using administrative records from national health services, we will examine whether the intervention increased screening appointments and Pap take-up rates. We will also test differential effects by socioeconomic status, education and time since the last screening test was taken, if any. We will also implement an end-line survey to measure beliefs about the importance of testing, and how prone women are to use digital tools and receive text messages to increase their preventive health behaviors.
