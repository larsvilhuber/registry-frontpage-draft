abstract: "In this project, I want to examine whether subjects respond differently to the presence of asylum seekers (AS) when this presence showcases flaws in the asylum system. Because the asylum system was specifically designed only to host those fleeing wars or persecution, I designed an information intervention in Germany in which subjects either receive information about the number of AS still in Germany who fled war or persecution, information about the corresponding number of those that came for other reasons, or no information."
