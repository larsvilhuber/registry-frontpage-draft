abstract: "This study aims to examine if saliency of extreme actions to secure a COVID-19 affects demand for the vaccine. Specifically, we will design an economic experiment to test the effect on vaccine demand from information about rich people jumping the line or information about vaccine hunters. We will use willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a service to facilitate the booking of vaccine appointments as a proxy for demand for the vaccine itself."
