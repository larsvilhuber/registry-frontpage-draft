abstract: "We implemented a RCT of body-worn cameras in the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil. In partnership with the State Military Police (PMSC), we randomized the roster of 450 police officers with public facing duties across 5 police precincts to either a treatment or a control group in a 1:3 ratio. To estimating learning effects, we also randomly provided blackout days, in which no officers would be allowed to wear cameras during their shifts. Our analysis is done at the police dispatch/event level, in which police-citizen interactions unfold."
