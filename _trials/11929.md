abstract: "Many college students in the United States, especially first-generation college students and those from low income backgrounds, face numerous barriers that prevent them from completing their intended course of study. 10,000 Degrees is a nonprofit that seeks to address this completion crisis and promote educational equity by serving primarily low-income and first generation students of color from the San Francisco Bay Area through its College Success Program. Participants in this program receive a scholarship and have access to additional resources including group events, scholarship-related reminders, answers to their questions, and referral to on-campus support. Traditionally, participants have also had access to on-demand mentoring from a College Success Fellow. However, not all students utilize these available mentoring services, and many who do may only attend one or two mentoring meetings. In this project, we will partner with 10,000 Degrees to study the effect of a more proactive, intensive mentorship model as part of the College Success Program. This study will use a randomized controlled trial design to compare the outcomes of scholarship recipients who receive the standard scholarship and services with no mentorship with those of recipients who receive proactive mentoring along with the scholarship and services. The study will enroll 1000 students over two years of enrollment, with 500 individuals assigned to the treatment group and 500 assigned to the control group. The sample will include College Success scholarship recipients, selected based on family income and being from a partner region or high school, who accept their award and enroll full time in a four-year college. The intervention will last until four years after the second year of study enrollment. We hypothesize that proactive, intensive mentoring will measurably improve these students’ outcomes, including rates of full-time enrollment, persistence from first to second year of college, bachelor’s degree completion within four years, and students’ debt after college. The study will also investigate whether any treatment effects vary across groups of students and will compare the costs and benefits associated with intensive mentoring. Proactive mentoring is time- and cost-intensive. However, if it is shown to be effective, implementing this service may be worthwhile for 10,000 Degrees and other nonprofits."
