abstract: "First offered by the Juanita Sims Doty Foundation (JDSF) in 2013, the Ambassadors of the Evers Academy for African American Males (A-TEAAM) mentoring program provides one-on-one and group support to young males of color in middle school through a “village of mentors” that engages them with a curriculum for character and leadership development. This programming is designed to equip participating students with the skills, knowledge, and support to increase self-esteem and confidence to overcome obstacles. JSDF is interested in measuring the impact of this program and has partnered with the Wilson-Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunities (LEO) to conduct an impact evaluation of A-TEAAM on student outcomes such as attendance, drop-out rate, suspension, and academic performance (e.g., grades/test scores). To measure effects of the program, we will conduct a randomized control trial and compare outcomes between (1) students referred to the program and randomly selected to participate and (2) students referred to the program but randomly selected not to participate.
