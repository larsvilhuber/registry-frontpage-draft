abstract: "There is evidence that fictional works influence readers and shape their views. We study the effect of Potterian economics—the economic ideas found in Harry Potter books, on the books’ readers. To assess the effect of Potterian economics on the views and sentiments of the readers of Harry Potter on economic matters, we conducted surveys in Israel and Georgia. The experimental design enables us to control for (a) socio-demographic factors, for factors related to (b) general reading-preferences and (c) fantasy-genre reading-preferences, and for (d) movie-watching versus book-reading preferences, suggesting that the effect of the Potterian economics that we document is causal."
