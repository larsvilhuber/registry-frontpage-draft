abstract: "Although there has been recent progress towards simplifying our federal financial aid policies and forms, many families - particularly first-generation college-attending, low-income and minority students - have little knowledge about financial aid, the types of aid available, and how and when to apply for it. Our research project examines the effects of a set of interventions focused on key problems related to eligibilit, application procedures, and financial aid awards.  Using a subsample of the 2015-16 National Postsecondary Aid Study (NPSAS) and administrative data sources, we test whether providing clear, student-specific, targeted information (rather than general information) to students improves the likelihood of FAFSA submission, receipt of financial aid, and student persistence.   In collaboration with RTI, the contractor responsible for NPSAS data collection, and the Department of Education, we randomly assign individuals to receive different types of information about financial aid.  The sample participated in the NPSAS data collection in 2015-16, and our intervention targets these individuals in the early months of 2017.  The three main aspects of financial aid upon which we are focusing are: (i) eligibility, (ii) application procedures, and (iii) award rules. Additionally, we will aim to explore whether the message framing (positive, negative, or neutral) influences student behavior. We hope to contribute to the existing literature and, if our interventions prove successful, provide a model for relatively easy and cost-effective replication on a larger scale. "
