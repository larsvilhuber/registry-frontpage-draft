abstract: "The first large random assignment study of a multisite employment program, Supported Work offered a year of carefully structured, paid work to four groups of hard-to-employ people: former prisoners, former addicts, young school dropouts, and single mothers who were long-term recipients of welfare. The evaluation found that the program significantly increased the post-program employment of welfare recipients and reduced their receipt of cash assistance but did not have consistent impacts for the other three groups.
