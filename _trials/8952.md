abstract: "One-third of children in low- and middle-income countries experience growth faltering. In Indonesia, 37 percent of children under the age of five are stunted (height-for-age z-score1 [HAZ] < -2), with limited progress in recent years. Linear growth deficits are an indicator of undernutrition, caused largely by poor nutritional intake and repeated infections that inhibit micronutrient absorption. These same exposures inhibit child neurodevelopment, contributing to cognitive deficits that often persist well into adulthood.

We developed a home-based growth chart that offers a simple and inexpensive way for caregivers to track their child's growth, along with information and encouragement to improve their child's health and nutrition. Results from a pilot study conducted in rural Zambia suggest that growth charts installed in homes can increase awareness and reduce early-life growth deficits, particularly among children experiencing growth faltering.

The main objective of this study is to assess the impact of growth charts through a cluster-randomized trial in Indonesia."
