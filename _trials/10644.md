abstract: "We study the acceptability of congestion charges through an information treatment experiment conducted within a large-scale survey with 15,000 participants from seven European countries. Each sub-sample being representative for the respective countryâ€™s general population, we randomly assign the participants to one of three groups. The first group receives information on positive effects that congestion charges have had in cities where they were implemented, the second group receives the information that in two cities, Stockholm and Gothenburg, the opinion of citizens about the policy improved after its implementation, and the third group does not receive any information treatment and serves as the control group. After this information treatment, acceptance of a congestion charge is elicited on a 5-point Likert scale. Socioeconomic data, relevant opinions and beliefs, and a large suite of mobility-related variables are collected within the survey to serve as control variables in the subsequent analysis."
