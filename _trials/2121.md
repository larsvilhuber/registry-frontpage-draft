abstract: "What makes agricultural extension fail in developing countries? In particular, are agricultural extension services offered to the wrong people? Will technology diffuse faster if extension is offered to seed dealers rather than directly to farmers? These questions are important because agricultural extension is generally viewed as under-performing in developing countries. New and innovate approaches need to be tested in order to incrase the rate at which improved technologies diffuse to farmers. The improved technology being studied in the experiment is Swarna-Sub1,  an improved rice variety that is nearly identical to Swarna (Eastern India's most popular rice variety). The difference between Swarna-Sub1 and Swarna is that Swarna-Sub1 is more flood tolerant. The objective of this study is not to test the efficacy of Swarna-Sub1, as this has been done in previous work. Rather, this study aims to test two alternative mechanisms to make Swarna-Sub1 diffuse faster."
