abstract: "In a laboratory experiment, we examine whether loss contracts are detrimental to cooperation. In particular, we aim at investigating whether the agent’s experience of a penalty (having to pay back money when not meeting a target) has a negative impact on the willingness to cooperate. In the experiment, participants first perform a real-effort task and then participate in a public goods game. The payment scheme in the real-effort task varies across treatments. More specifically, we implement a gain and a loss contract that are payoff equivalent and only differ in framing. Cooperation is measured as contributions of the agents to a public good. "
