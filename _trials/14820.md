abstract: "In many settings, economic outcomes depend on the competence and effort of the
agents involved, and also on luck. When principals assess agents’ performance they can
suffer from attribution bias by gender: male agents may be assessed more favorably than
female agents because males will be rewarded for good luck, while women are punished for
bad luck. We conduct a laboratory experiment to test whether principals judge agents’
outcomes differently by gender. Agents perform tasks for the principals and the realized
outcomes depend on both the agents’ performance and luck. Principals then assess agents’
performance and decide what to pay the agents. We aim to vary the type of tasks performed and measure whether principals show attribution bias. We aim to extend this to study whether attribution bias exists against other minorities."
