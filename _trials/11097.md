abstract: "The project examines the effect of digital and social skills on the likelihood that workers will be hired. For these hiring decisions, we particularly investigate for which work contexts (workplace characteristics, team member characteristics) workers with different types of social, digital and occupational skills are recruited. For example, firms differ in their IT investments or teams differ in terms of their work situation (e.g., division of tasks) and team composition (e.g., age, gender, qualification of team members). HR decision-makers in real firms are the respondents of our project. A vignette module is anchored in the BIBB Establishment Panel on Qualification and Competence Development, Wave 2023."
