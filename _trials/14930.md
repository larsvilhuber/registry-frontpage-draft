abstract: "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming an increasingly important skill in the labor market, but will it also affect academic success? Recent research shows that current students --who will be facing this rapidly changing labor market-- are adopting AI tools at differential rates based on both gender and ability. Whether AI will affect adopters’ academic success hinges on whether AI interferes with or enhances learning, which in turn depends on whether AI is being used as a substitute for or complement of own effort. If AI harms learning, students with high adoption rates would be worse prepared for the labor market than those with low adoption rates. If AI enhances learning, students who do not become proficient at AI would be left behind. To assess the impact of AI on learning, we run a controlled lab experiment which allows us to restrict and allow access to AI in different between-subject treatment variations in which students learn about a new topic. We explore whether AI is employed in a way that causally creates a gap in learning and as a consequence payoffs. Our results provide evidence on the important question of whether the documented differential adoption and use of AI by gender and ability is likely to create gender gaps in academic success. In addition, we explore several mechanisms such as over-reliance on generative AI tools, engagement and motivation."
