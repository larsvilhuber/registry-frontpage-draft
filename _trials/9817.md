abstract: "Prior research has documented that consumers act as if they ignore hidden costs (such as sales tax). The goal of our research is to understand why this is the case, by explicitly testing several hypotheses. In prior work, we have tested whether inattention is likely attributable to lack of knowledge, lack of accurate information, or forgetfulness. These hypotheses are not supported by the data. We also tested whether constraints on cognitive resources, slack budget constraints, how prices and costs are presented affect attention."
