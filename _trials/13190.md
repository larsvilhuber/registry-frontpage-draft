abstract: "We study the implementation of body-worn cameras (BWCs) by the Military Police in the state of Bahia, Brazil. The state has one of the highest criminality rates and the second highest police lethality in the country. The process is starting with a pilot run in a few precincts of the capital city, Salvador, making use of 85 cameras. We randomized the roster of police officers with public facing duties across the precincts to either a treatment or a control group in a 1:1 ratio. Those selected to use the cameras will do so in every shift; control officers will not wear the camera in any shift. We stratify by police precinct and type of policing; when a shift had two or more units with differential spatial coverage, we further stratified by shift. Our analysis is done at the police dispatch/event level in which police-citizen interactions unfold."
