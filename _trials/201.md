abstract: "We ran a pilot that evaluated a program seeking to assist unemployed youth (18-35) to obtain a valid driver's license by providing full and partial scholarships towards the road-safety training course and road test booking.  We subsequently planned to track their employment outcomes there-after in order to evaluate the impact that a driver's license had on their employability. However, due to very poor learners' and drivers' license pass rates, the evaluation was halted. The evaluation was conducted as a randomized evaluation, where a sample of eligible unemployed youth was identified in Guateng (approximately 60 in total) and were invited to a screening day where we conducted a short survey to determine their current employability (skills, education, etc), their job-seeking activities (what jobs to they apply for, how do they apply, etc?) and gauge there interest in the driving program."
