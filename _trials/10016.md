abstract: "This project studies whether workers affected by the pandemic benefited from access to free certificates and degrees provided by massive open online courses (MOOCs). One of the largest and most recognized MOOC providers offered governments in Latin America free certificates during the first outbreak of Covid-19 in the region. As part of this program, a government agency in Colombia conducted an RCT where 10,000 beneficiaries of student loans received the opportunity to enroll and certify their skills in MOOCs. The project will study participants' behavior on the platform, including selection, enrollment, and completion of online courses. Furthermore, it will track participants to the labor market to study the impact of MOOCs on formal employment and wages during and after the pandemic."
