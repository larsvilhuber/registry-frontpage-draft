abstract: "In this study, we employ a lab-in-the-field experiment with about 720 adolescents from about 36 classes in Austria. We simulate saving decisions in a controlled lab environment in classrooms that involves multiple decisions over time with a potential economic shock at the end. The idea is to simulate a decision under risk in which people with higher buffer stock are better capable to withstand a shock. We study several aspects of saving decisions. First, we investigate individual-level factors that may influence the decision to save or not to save such as risk preferences, loss aversion, cognitive reflection/impulsivity, and numeracy (financial literacy). Second, we study the effectiveness of two soft commitment devices, i.e., commitment devices that neither induce monetary costs nor do they restrict actions. We chose commitment devices that have not been studied, yet, to alter saving decisions and that would be relatively easy to teach and apply in real life. This is motivational goal bracketing and episodic future thinking. The study has been approved by the ethical committee of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Vienna."
