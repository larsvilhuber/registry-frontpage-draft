abstract: "Experimenter demand effect is a concern in all non-natural experiments with human participants, which refers to changes in behavior by participants trying to infer the experimenterâ€™s objective (Zizzo 2010). For example, participants who believe the researcher wants to promote energy-efficient appliance adoption might show higher willingness-to-pay (WTP) than they otherwise would. In this study, we apply the method proposed by De Quidt et al. (2018) to measure the upper and lower bound of experimenter demand effect of an information treatment intervention. By exposing participants to demand treatments, which are likely to be more informative than implicit signals about demand in typical information intervention studies, we measure the strongest possible treatment effect under th"
