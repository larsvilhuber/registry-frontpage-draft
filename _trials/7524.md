abstract: "The purpose of the research project is to use field experiments (correspondence tests) to investigate whether language skills in Swedish affect the probability of getting a callback for a job interview for different groups of immigrants. To this end, we set up field experiments in which fictitious job applications with different language levels are sent to employers with advertised jobs in the Swedish labor market. The applicants’ language skills and country of origin in randomly assigned to the job applications, and hence we can measure the causal effects of these factors."
