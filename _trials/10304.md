abstract: "This project is a collaboration with Catholic Charities Los Angeles (CCLA) to study the impact of their Conrad Career Associates program, an extension of their WIOA programming, on participants’ employment and education outcomes. One of CCLA’s primary programs is Archdiocesan Youth Employment Services (AYE), a 12-month workforce development WIOA program that provides services to youth that are facing barriers to employment. To study the effects of providing additional supportive services to youth exiting WIOA programming, youth exiting AYE will be invited to participate in CCLA’s new Conrad Career Associates program. The program will offer additional supportive services to AYE graduates for up to three years. Applicants will be randomly assigned into one of two groups: the treatment group (offered a spot in the Conrad Career Associates) and the control group (not offered a spot in the program). This study will use a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the intervention against the control group that does not have access to the Conrad Career Associates program. The goal of the study is to enroll 250 individuals over 3 years into the treatment group and an additional 500 individuals into the control group, for a total of 750 study participants. We hypothesize that a supplemental WIOA program such as Conrad Career Associates will lead to participants having improved employment and educational outcomes. Outcomes measured in administrative records and with an 18 month and three-year follow up survey will include housing stability, creditworthiness and use of credit, financial health, education level, community engagement, and income."
