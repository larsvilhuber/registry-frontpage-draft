abstract: "Globally, nearly 3 billion people cook with traditional stoves and fuels. Household air pollution represents the largest energy-
related health risk, leading to nearly 2.3 million preventable pollution-related
deaths per year. Previous efforts to drive clean fuel transitions by targeting subsidies to the
poor have largely been unsuccessful. This project tests a novel and scalable
approach that utilizes insights from second degree price discrimination and
ordeal mechanisms to balance the cost of subsidization with the social benefits
of clean fuel use. Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT), the project will
evaluate the impact of targeting on overall LPG use and its cost effectiveness,
compared to untargeted subsidies. We will also measure how the use of clean fuel translates into overall and gender-specific reductions in personal exposure to air pollution. The results of this study will inform the Government of Ghana’s
household energy policy, which focuses on improving the country’s LPG
distribution system.
