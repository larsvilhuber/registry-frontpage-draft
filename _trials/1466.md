abstract: "Intensified use of agricultural inputs, particularly fertilizer, is a possible route to improved agricultural productivity. Field trials of these technologies show substantial increases in yields, but are typically done on highly monitored experimental plots rather than by farmers themselves. We conducted a field experiment in southern Mali and randomly provided free fertilizer to female rice farmers to measure how farmers chose to use the fertilizer, what changes they made to their agricultural practices, and the profitability of these changes. We find that farmers who received fertilizer were more likely to use fertilizer, increased the quantity of fertilizer used on their plots, used more complementary inputs such as labor and herbicides and had increased yields. We however find no evidence of increase in agricultural profits."
