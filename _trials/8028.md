abstract: "The five-decade-old economics literature investigating the private provision of charity has entirely ignored measurement of how much those voluntary contributions impact recipients’ well-being. Instead, the literature has implicitly assumed that every extra dollar contributed to a charitable organization, and spent on recipients, results in an improvement in recipient well-being (i.e., happiness and/or life satisfaction). 
We will test for the effect of receiving charity on recipient well-being using a laboratory experiment. Our method for testing whether receiving charity always increases well-being will be to create an environment where people have the opportunity to ask for charity in the laboratory. If people choose not to ask for charity, then this implies asking for charity would reduce their well-being. We also plan to analyze whether “attribution” (the narrative around why people need charity) affects whether people choose to ask for charity or not. Specifically, we will analyze whether there is a difference in rates of asking for charity when the narrative attributes the results to an external cause (due to luck) or an internal cause (due to ability).
