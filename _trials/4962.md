abstract: "Evidence from different disciplines, including behavioral economics, psychology and political science, suggests that conversation-based interventions may reduce prejudice against out-groups, at least in the short term (Broockman and Kalla 2016). In this study, we plan to compare the effects of two interventions in a randomized online field experiment, using a representative sample of the United States population. 
We will implement three experimental conditions in an online platform (Dynata), randomizing participants into a perspective-taking treatment, a value-consistency treatment, and a control condition. Participants will be asked to watch a video, do a writing exercise, play a trust game, and complete a survey. Results will be used to test the effectiveness of the two debiasing techniques.
