abstract: "The main objective of this project is to test the effects of feedback with and without relative ranking scores on SMEs and first-time applicants performance in the funding program “General Programme” of the FFG, and business performance after the program. The feedback for each firm will be based on evaluations scores of the respective funding proposal from project evaluators in the FFG. The participants in the RCT are all Start-ups, SMEs, and large companies who are first-time applicants accepted into the funding program in the timespan of a year. The trial will be two-armed, with control and a treatment group. The control group will receive a written feedback on their proposal. The treatment group will receive the same format of feedback but with an additional relative ranking score. "
