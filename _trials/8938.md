abstract: "For many patients suffering from blood cancer, such as leukemia, who lack a related donor, a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a matching unrelated donor offers the best treatment and chance of survival. However, a substantial proportion of registered donors is unavailable to donate stem cells when invited to confirmatory typing (CT). At this decisive stage in the donation process, a matching patient has been found for the potential donor, and the donor is required to undertake medical checks to confirm genetic and medical suitability. Worldwide, unavailability ranges from about 25% to 50%. Reducing the unavailability rate can save lives, and is a key outcome of stem cell donation studies. "
