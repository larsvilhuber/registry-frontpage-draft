abstract: "This is an RCT aimed at micro-businesses with 1-9 employees. It is testing whether advice and coaching to treated business through a University-affiliated business school can encourage greater deployment of digital technologies within those businesses. Digital technologies are believed to be an important driver of raising productivity within businesses. We are testing whether an increased understanding and business planning for how such technologies could be deployed in each treated business actually leads to greater adoption and improved business performance metrics.
Total sample size is 750 businesses across 15 University business schools, covered by the Chartered Association of Business Schools (CharteredABS.org)
The trial is funded by the UK Department of Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS), in association with Nesta, as part of the Business Basics experimentation fund."
