abstract: "This trial is a replication trial of AEARCTR-0003957. We evaluate a large-scale pedagogical intervention that aims to cultivate and stimulate curiosity in the classroom environment. The study is motivated by the evidence on the importance of curiosity as a fundamental driver of academic achievement. 

Teachers are given 6 months to implement the proposed pedagogy supported by the activities prescribed in the teacher toolkit. This trial involves 84 schools in the province of Adana, Turkey, and targets 4th-grade students. The objective of this trial is to i) replicate the findings of the previous trial, ii) increase the statistical power of the first trial by adding 84 more schools to the sample.
