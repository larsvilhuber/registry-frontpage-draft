abstract: "More than 60% of global employees work in the informal economy. One of the reasons that firms remain in informality is the length and cost of the formalization process, with uncertain benefits. We explore a treatment that could reduce informality in the mining sector in Colombia, a segment of the economy that supports more than 300,000 workers and their families. The treatment addresses the supply side with assistance with the formalization process."
