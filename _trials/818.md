abstract: "Workers in developing countries often have limited information about job risks. As a result, workers may not be compensated for bearing workplace risks (Smith, 1979). Furthermore, worker-firm matches may be inefficient, which may generate turnover (Viscusi, 1979), and labor markets may be incomplete. There is a lack of empirical evidence, however, about how imperfect information about job risks affects employment outcomes for these workers. Furthermore, little is known known about their willingness, if informed about job risks, to trade-off wages for exposure to risk. This research aims to provide the first experimental evidence of how limited information about job risks affects workers’ employment outcomes in developing countries and to identify these workers’ wage-safety elasticity. I study Bangladesh’s ready-made garment (RMG) sec- tor, where I document that workers are largely unable to perceive their jobs’ riskiness. I analyze how an information asymmetry about safety between workers and factory owners affects workers’ abilities to make optimal employment decisions. I conduct a field experiment with 309 workers in Savar, a sub-district of Dhaka home to many garment factories. In the experiment, I provide a randomly selected group of workers with information about their factories’ performances, and the performances of numerous factories nearby, on third-party safety audits. I use follow-up phone calls and other methods to determine how the information affects workers’ perceptions about safety and employment decisions."
