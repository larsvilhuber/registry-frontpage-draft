abstract: "Skills mismatch, defined by the discrepancy between workers’ skills and job skill requirements, can have negative effects on workers’ income and career progression. Past research has studied its causes separately which include (i) workers not fully knowing their own skill levels; (ii) lacking of labour market information; (iii) lacking confidence and adherence to social norms. For example, female workers may perceive that a programmer is not a suitable job for women. 

The project will study the role of these three factors and their interactions on skills mismatch using a randomised controlled trial (RCT). The RCT involves giving participants who are final-year college students in Thailand different treatments. The three main treatments are as follows: providing information on individual ability; providing information on labour markets; and promoting growth mindset in a job search process context. The project will collect panel data on actual labour market outcomes, subjective beliefs and individual characteristics then analyse mechanisms and consequences of skills mismatch. "
