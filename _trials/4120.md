abstract: "This study aims to test whether providing information that intends to relieve individuals concerns about HIV-related social stigma improves HIV testing rates in vulnerable households in Mozambique. Based on a local social opinion survey before this study, the treatment group will receive individually-tailored information indicating supportive social opinions about HIV in their neighborhood. The primary outcome of interest is the usage of HIV-testing coupons, which will be distributed to all study participants and redeemable upon taking an HIV test in the local clinic."
