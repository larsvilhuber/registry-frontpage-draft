abstract: "A striking feature of the lives of women living in rural India is their lack of agency. Decisions regarding female labor force participation (FLFP) are a case in point. I study FLFP in rural Uttar Pradesh through a partnership with a large Indian carpet manufacturer. The firm offers a weaving job for women that women themselves are very interested in taking. Yet, consistent with a lack of agency over the decision, women enroll at very low rates. 

Intra-household barriers are often cited as a leading cause for women’s lack of agency; cultural norms in the setting lead women’s lives to be largely controlled by husbands and in-laws. However, a lack of agency may also reflect important, and often overlooked, psychological roots. In particular, women’s agency may be constrained by a lack of generalized efficacy (i.e. the conviction that one has the ability to attain desired outcomes) in women’s own psychology. 

This project will offer randomly chosen women a psychosocial intervention designed to enhance generalized efficacy. The aim of this intervention is to give women the psychological assets required to act on their desires. I will investigate the effect of this intervention on enrollment in the weaving job and on other economic outcomes that represent commonly held goals of women in the setting.

Psychological efficacy will interact crucially with intra-household constraints on women’s agency whenever women’s desires conflict with those of their family members. On the one hand, the actions efficacy inspires may only be fruitful if not met with opposition from husbands and in-laws. On the other hand, the internal assets that efficacy engenders may allow women to overcome intra-household barriers on their own. Intra-household constraints will be particularly important in FLFP decisions as husbands and in-laws typically oppose women working outside of the home. I will therefore offer a second, cross-randomized intervention that markets the women’s weaving opportunity directly to husbands and in-laws so as to reduce intra-household opposition women face in enrollment. I will investigate the effect of this intervention, both given alone and together with the efficacy intervention, on enrollment decisions.
