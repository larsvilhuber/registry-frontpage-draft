abstract: "The study investigates how people incorporate interest-rate information in their lifetime consumption and savings decisions, and how their choices depend on their income. In an experimental environment, we expose subjects to different levels of income and different amounts of information about the interest rate state governing the returns on their savings. Additionally, we elicit their willingness to pay for interest-rate information to assess its perceived relevance in their behaviour, conditional on income. "
