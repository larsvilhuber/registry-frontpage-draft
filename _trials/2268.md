abstract: "What are the effects of sanitation interventions on welfare? Every year, thousands of citizens in developing countries die as a consequence of poor water and sanitation conditions. This situation is particularly harsh for young children and newborns, as acute diaharreal disease has huge negative consequences on this population.  Consequently, estimating the effects of interventions on sanitation infrastructure on health and other welfare conditions of poor households is crucial, in order to determine the effectiveness of these programs. We exploit a potential natural experiment that took place in Panama recently. The San Miguelito project is a huge sanitation infrastructure intervention, in which thousands of households in Panama City's poorest district get access to the sewage system. However, planning and execution errors imply that certain sectors of the district are no included in the project, leaving a big number of houses, comparable to those that will be treated, out of the intervention. After checking if there is balance between treatment and control groups, and adjusting for any imbalances between them, we will exploit this natural experiment through a difference in differences estimation, to determine the impact of the San Miguelito project on several welfare and health indicators, including prevalence of parasites on stool samples for children below 5 years. To account for potential spillover effects, we also include a distant control group, composed of households living in a different district far away of San Miguelito, but that shares similar socioeconomic characteristics. We hypothesize that the intervention has positive effects on several health and anthopometric indicators, such as diarrhea disease on young children, weight and height, and in other important dimensions, such as school attendance, productivity, or psychological health."
