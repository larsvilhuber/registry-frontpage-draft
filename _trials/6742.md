abstract: "In this study, we evaluate the effect of schools reopening in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic on students' educational and health outcomes, their families' health and economic outcomes, and school staff's health outcomes. A subset of schools in São Paulo, Brazil, reopened at the beginning of October. We will combine administrative and phone survey data as well as quasi-experimental and experimental methods to evaluate the effect of the reopening on the outcomes of interest. In the experiment, we randomly encourage students in some schools, but not others, to returns to in-person classes when they resume."
