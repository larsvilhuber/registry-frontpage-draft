abstract: "NExTWORK is an active labour market programme (ALMP) currently undergoing evaluation in Denmark. The NExTWORK programme links youth between the ages of 18 and 29, who have no labour-market relevant qualification and who receive social assistance, with companies willing to offer internships. Rather than being assigned internships, youth in NExTWORK come into direct contact with companies at programme-facilitated matching events, and internships are then allocated based on an expression of mutual interest. The programme then provides ongoing support to the youth throughout their internships from both a counselor and weekly peer-support groups. Participating firms also receive guidance through company coordinators and their own support network.

This programme is designed to address some of the shortcomings that have been identified in previous ALMPs and within the current Danish system. Evaluations of such programmes have typically found them to be least effective for younger adults, those from socially disadvantaged backgrounds, and those with very low skills or motivation.
