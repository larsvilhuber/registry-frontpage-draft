abstract: "The children of upper social classes have historically enjoyed privileged access to higher education and enhanced earning potential. However, limited research exists on how explicit signals of candidates' social class background influence hiring decisions. This study aims to conduct a field experiment examining how social class signals conveyed by job candidates affect both interviewer evaluations and hiring intentions."
