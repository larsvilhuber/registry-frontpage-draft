abstract: "In this project, we aim to analyze how the informativeness of reviews of therapists on an online mental health platform in Singapore affects therapistsâ€™ attractiveness and customers' learning process. We will randomize over customers. In particular, each customer will be assigned into either treatment group or control group. In treatment group, customers can view additional information of reviews generated by former customers, while customers in control group with only observe the review contents. Our outcomes variables include conversion rate, retention rate, and time spent on each therapist's page, number of therapists browsed by each customer in each conversion funnel. We anticipate that the additional information can help improve the overall conversion and help customers to better learn the therapists."
