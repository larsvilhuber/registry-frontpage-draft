abstract: "Command and control instruments, such as plastic-bag bans, have been effective in countries with a robust enforcement mechanism. In developing countries, these instruments have been partially effective in the short term but with no long-time effects due to many factors such as weak enforcement and lack of compliance, especially in the wholesale market. The farmers market is an open market with high consumption of plastic bags, which are commonly given to the consumers for free as a courtesy, from which more than 50% end up in the landfill. 
Literature shows that changes in behavior can be observed if alternative solutions are provided to consumers. In the specific case of plastic, biodegradable products could be an option to substitute single-use plastic, especially in environments where regulation is low. Farmers' markets in Costa Rica are well established and have specific guidelines and rules for its operation, representing an opportunity to work closely and test different strategies to reduce plastic consumption in this sector. The project's aim is to identify the effect of pricing and default options on consumption behavior when providing environmentally friendly alternatives in the wholesale market. 

We will implement a field experiment in 12 farmers' markets in Costa Rica. Three treatments will be implemented: 1) the provision of biodegradable and plastic bags for free, 2)the provision of biodegradable bags at a cost keeping the non-biodegradable bags free of charge; and, 3) a treatment where the biodegradable bags are the default option with an associated cost. 

We hypothesize that consumers will consume more biodegradable bags when they are provided free of charge, a rebound effect of introducing a more "environmentally friendly substitute." The impact of the default option with the price is anticipated to have a positive impact by reducing plastic consumption as a whole. We expect our results to show that more environmentally friendly alternative products free of charge will not necessarily reduce consumption. Therefore, strategies to reduce plastic pollution should be oriented to reduce current consumption patterns."
