abstract: "This study evaluates the effectiveness of VSLAs in improving households' well-being, and tests if the model contributes to borrowers' progression up the lending ladder and graduation into access to credit from formal financial institutions. Relying on a clustered randomized control trial, we evaluate the impact of the introduction of savings groups on poverty, risk-coping strategies, and access to credit from other lenders in rural Peru."
