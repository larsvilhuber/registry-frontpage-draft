abstract: "This is a follow-up survey of the study experiment conducted in July 2024. The goal of the project is to study the impact of the floods that heavily hit Emilia Romagna and Tuscany in 2023 and 2024, and the preparedness to extreme climatic events. We designed an original survey instrument to assess whether being exposed to information about the dangers of flood events impacts individuals' support for measures of climate change mitigation."
