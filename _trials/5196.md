abstract: "The Office of Evaluation Sciences is collaborating with the Atlanta VA Health Care System to increase seasonal flu immunizations among veterans. The intervention targets physicians, advanced practice providers, and nurses. It includes a behaviorally informed performance report card that compares the vaccination rates for the recipient patient aligned care team (PACT) to the top ten percent of PACTs in the Atlanta VA Health Care System. Report cards will be delivered via email. They also include an attached PDF leaflet with evidence-based actionable recommendations for PACTs and a link to frequently asked questions on the intervention, data used and why providers are receiving the report card email. The intervention will be delivered to PACTs monthly in four rounds, from early November through early February. Final, patient-level outcomes data will be pulled from Atlanta VAâ€™s electronic health record system one month after the final delivery of the intervention."
