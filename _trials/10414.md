abstract: "While race-based identify has become a salient issue in higher education admissions, we ask whether gender identity matters as well. Specifically, we ask whether non-binary/trans individuals experience discrimination in access to higher education. To address this question, we conduct an audit study. Email inquiries will be sent to admissions counselors at institutions of higher education in the United States. Emails will differ in their use of gender pronouns in the signature line. Our outcome variable of interest is whether we receive a reply to the email. The control will be emails without any use of pronouns. Emails with either he/him or she/her signatures identify the effect of using a pronoun, while a treatment with the use of xe/xem in the signature line will separately identify the effect of neo-pronouns from "traditional" pronouns. We hypothesize that the use of neo-pronouns will be associated with fewer responses to our email inquiries. "
