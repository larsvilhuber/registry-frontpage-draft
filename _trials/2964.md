abstract: "Policy makers are largely using behavioral interventions to improve education, health, security and sustainable behavior. This article uses behavioral intervention to evaluate the impact of two interventions aimed at reducing smokers’ littering. We ran a field experiment at eight beach resorts in the north east of Italy. Resorts were randomly assigned to three groups: in the first, we introduced portable ashtrays to test whether smokers respond to the lower effort costs (time plus inconvenience) by disposing of litter properly. In the second set, we added a request not to litter. The third group of resorts was used as a control with no intervention. The results suggest that both treatments significantly affect littering, leading to a reduction in the number of cigarette filters dropped in the sand, compared to beaches with no ashtrays. Reinforcing the presence of portable ashtrays with social prompts did not generate a statistically significantly different effect."
