abstract: "Minnesota Family Investment Program (MFIP), piloted from 1994 through 1998, combined employment mandates with financial work incentives. MFIP was characterized by four key features: a requirement that long-term recipients work or participate in employment-focused services; financial work incentives for recipients who worked; payment of working recipients’ child care costs directly to providers (rather than reimbursement of recipients later); and simpler public assistance rules and procedures that combined different programs into one and provided food stamps as part of the cash welfare grant. The hope was that combining welfare-to-work strategies with financial incentives designed to “make work pay” would make both aspects more effective and reduce hardship.

More than 14,000 single-parent and two-parent families in seven Minnesota counties were randomly assigned; more than 3,000 were excluded because of welfare status or missing baseline information. The 6-year follow-up sample consists of 9,658 families.
