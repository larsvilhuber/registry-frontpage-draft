abstract: "We study the incidence of different equilibria in a three-player "battle-of-the-sexes" type game. Payoff increases in coordination so that player prefer to coordinate on one action. Each player has a preferred coordination action. We study what equilibria are played when we increase the payoff to coordinate on ones preferred action. "
