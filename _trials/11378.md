abstract: "Misperceptions regarding the social appropriateness of condom purchase can potentially lead to
the internalization of social stigma concerns, which in turn discourage people from acting on their
true preferences for condom purchase. I propose to implement a field experiment in Ghana on
a student sample, in which I will first test the existence of misperceptions regarding the social
appropriateness of condom purchase. Next, I will use an information provision treatment to correct
the largest misperception I detect and investigate if treated participants update their beliefs, and
thus, initiate behaviour change. I will use a series of condom vouchers distributed to participants
to estimate a repeated objective behavioral measure of condom purchase. This will also allow me to
determine how long treatment effects last. In order to know what makes information provision more
efficient, I will investigate if the reputation of the information conveyor magnifies the efficiency of
information provided. Owing to the re-calibrating effects of informational treatments, I anticipate
that if a participant has social image concerns, the treatment will induce this participant to act in
accordance with the views of peers he has been exposed to. The implications of my findings may
be beneficial for the healthcare sector, and for the development of effective policies."
