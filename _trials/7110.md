abstract: "It is a puzzle why people punish in social dilemmas. This study theoretically and experimentally explores the psychological and social determinants of cooperation and punishments in the voluntary contribution mechanism with punishment (VCMP). We propose that the determinants of punishment may be psychological and may lie in the belief-based emotions and preference; the determinants of contributions may lie in the anticipation of future punishment and the emotion of shame."
