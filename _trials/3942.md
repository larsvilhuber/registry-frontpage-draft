abstract: "Using an individual level randomization, we evaluate an alternative education program targeted at girls who have dropped out of secondary school in Tanzania. In the first phase, we randomly offered female applicants a BRAC program designed to prepare individuals to pass the Tanzanian secondary school exit exam and obtain their secondary school equivalency. In the second phase, we randomly offered applicants a scholarship that paid for the tuition at alternative centers that are designed to prepare individuals to pass the Tanzanian secondary school exit exam and obtain their secondary school equivalency."
