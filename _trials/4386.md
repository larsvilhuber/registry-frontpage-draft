abstract: "This document is an update to the study pre-registered with the AEA RCT Registry with ID AEARCTR-0003535. In a new wave of data collection , we will conduct a series of experimental games to:
1) assess whether parent-bias remains widespread in our sample when we allow respondents to chose an equal split of resources,
2)  measure the correlation between our experimental measure of parent-bias and the take-up of commitment devices when making investment decisions, 
3) contrast willingness-to-pay for commitment to stick to one's plans to invest in one's child and in another person's child and 
4)  estimate whether parent-biased respondents have a higher willingness-to-pay to open a bank account in their child's name.

The present document outlines the experimental design and the econometric methods we will use to assess those three points.
