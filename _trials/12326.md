abstract: "Health care decisions are sometimes a matter of life and death, but also their financial consequences can be disastrous for many households around the world. While one can imagine how the fear of making an expensive mistake may deter households from making otherwise sensible health care choices, there is almost no scientific evidence on the importance and joint role of medical and financial uncertainty. In this project, we first provide theoretical insights based on simulation exercises and develop a novel measurement instrument for medical and cost uncertainty using hypothetical health scenarios (vignettes). Initial analyses from data collected using this instrument with low-income households in Pakistan reveal that on top of many biases, both medical as well as cost uncertainty in health care decisions exist and may deter sensible health investments, in line with the theoretical predictions. As these results indicate potentially large dividends to providing accurate information, we are now conducting an extended vignette survey that includes three  within-survey information interventions targeted at changing medical or cost uncertainty separately or jointly. With this RCT, we aim to test in two intervention stages whether: i) the interventions reduce biases and uncertainties; ii) the interventions change the hypothetical health seeking decision; and iii) the joint intervention induces larger changes.
