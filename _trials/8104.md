abstract: "Adoption of technology can enable growth and increase productivity in firms in low and middle-income countries. However, adoption remains low for seemingly profitable technologies across varied settings. In this project I offer one specific explanation: that high learning costs at onset leads firms to make sub-optimal adoption choices. To study adoption choice, I offer firms access to a digital technology that helps them manage cash flow and maintain records of business transactions. In a field experiment in India, I randomize firms to treatment arms where learning costs are subsidized to varying degrees. In a setting where learning costs are salient and adoption choice is observable, I examine whether a temporary intervention that can subsidize learning costs can move firms from a low adoption equilibrium to a high adoption one. To guide the key predictions of the paper, I set up a model that describes technology adoption choices made by a firm that optimizes on an infinite horizon in discrete time. I then apply the model to shed light on the mechanisms through which temporarily subsidizing learning costs can enable to a firm to move to a high-adoption equilibrium.
