abstract: "The goal of the study is to determine whether providing information on the current state of affairs of STEM occupations/industries (in comparison with other occupations/industries) affects the major choice of science-track high school graduates. The information will be provided to high school graduates and their parents through a mobile website via private messaging through Wechat (a widely used messaging and social media app with over one billion users worldwide).
