abstract: "This study investigates how different peer information affect individuals' dynamic optimization decisions over repeated lifecycles. We compare individuals who make decisions alone over the lifecycles to the others who receive either a selected peer's decisions only, decisions along with outcome, or decisions along with confidence in a selected sequence. For this purpose, this study uses a simple deterministic decision making environment with no savings or borrowings where an individual's current decisions affect the future outcomes through the utility function. The outcomes of this study would help to identify how and what peer information can be used to nudge individuals in optimal decision making paths.  "
