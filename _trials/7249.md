abstract: "Most literature on business training has focused on adult entrepreneurs, while the potential to change the entrepreneurial mindset is probably greater among adolescents. Moreover, while COVID-19 highlighted the potential for remote delivery of business training to reach new participants at low cost, little evidence exists on the efficacy of online business training. We will evaluate the Wavumbuzi High School Challenge, an online program promoting entrepreneurial mindset among secondary school students. The Challenge launched in Rwanda in January 2021 and will run for 6 weeks. Among schools with students registered to participate in the challenge, we randomly assigned schools to receive program access or to a control group. We will compare students in treatment and control schools on entrepreneurial knowledge and mindset, aspirations, and economic activity."
