abstract: "Recent evidence suggests that programs aimed at increasing “mindfulness” are successful at reducing the cognitive demands of stress and increasing focus and attention. This pilot study applies this approach to improving parenting among disadvantaged families. In partnership with Chicago-based Head Start preschool centers, this pilot study will explore the feasibility of developing a technology-based mindfulness training intervention (i.e., with apps and videos) combined with behavioral devices such as reminders and goal-setting with the goal of improving executive function, and in turn the quality and quantity of time parents interact with their children and other parent and child outcomes. The results of the pilot work will be used to inform a large-scale RCT. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop a cost-effective scalable approach for fostering mindfulness in parents in order to foster children’s cognitive and non-cognitive development.
