abstract: "Reducing CO2 emissions from the transport sector is an increasingly important policy objective for governments and companies. To allow policymakers to achieve their objectives at a lower political and economic cost, a better understanding of the effectiveness of so called “soft” interventions such as targeted information provision, social norm activation and moral suasion in the transportation domain is needed. 

This study will analyze the effects of social comparisons and moral suasion on transport mode choice in a field experiment. We team up with a multinational corporation which provides its German employees with the option to participate in a novel corporate benefit scheme. In this scheme, participants are provided with an individual mobility budget they can use for private transportation expenditures. This mobility budget allows us to observe expenditures for different transport modes over a two-month intervention period and a two-month post-intervention period for approximately 465 participants. In our field experiment, participants will receive e-mails with treatment messages. Treatment group 1 (the control group) will receive a placebo text with information that is not related to transport mode choice. Treatment group 2 will receive a social comparison message contrasting the participants’ individual transportation behavior with the average in a peer group. Treatment group 3 will receive the same social comparison part as in group 2, plus an additional moral suasion part (in the same message). We will use the data from the mobility budget to analyze the effects of these treatments on the use of different transport modes.
