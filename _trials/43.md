abstract: "Growing populations of unemployed youth in post-conflict countries represent both an opportunity to develop and enhance the economy as well as a potential source of instability.  Despite high levels of investment in youth development programs in recent years, little evidence exists on which interventions are most effective in increasing economic opportunities for youth and reducing their risk of participating in violence and risky behaviors. Using a randomized evaluation design, this study aims to evaluate two such programs: Sports for Change (SfC), a program that provides life-skills training and psychosocial support through sports groups, and Cash for Work programs (CfW).  The evaluation focuses on outcomes of the program can plausibly change over the course of a year, such as stress levels (measured using biometric data), risk preferences, labor outcomes, tests for aggression, and self-reported risky behaviors.  Social network mapping will also be used to provide a rich perspective of linkages and ties of Liberian youth within and outside of their traditional communities. "
