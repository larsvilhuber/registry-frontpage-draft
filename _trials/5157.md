abstract: "Poverty confers many costs on individuals. Being poor harms health, reduces education, and lowers productivity. More insidiously, the stress and deprivation of poverty also levies a cognitive tax, which has the potential to further reduce welfare via decrements in the value of what little the poor are able to consume. This potential tax on utility and societal welfare has broad implications for our understanding of the costs of poverty -- shedding light on a compounding effect of deprivation on human welfare and changing the calculus of appropriate policies to combat poverty.

The proposed randomized controlled trial will generate rigorous causal evidence linking elements of life in poverty to changes in bandwidth and corresponding changes in the value of consumption. Participants will be low-income adults from the city of Chennai, India. The research will experimentally alter bandwidth via methods ranging from standard laboratory approaches (i.e. memorizing numbers) to methods which address the stresses of poverty (e.g. high levels of thirst due to heat and lack of access to clean water). Participants will then undertake simple laboratory based tasks to measure bandwidth and complete experimental activities (e.g. watching a short comedy video) and rate their value of these activities via methodologies drawn from multiple disciplines.
