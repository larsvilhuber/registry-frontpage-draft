abstract: "The intervention is aimed at long term recipients of welfare. It consists of attempts to place them in a job-training situation first and then simultaneously work with any other problems (physical or mental health, everyday coping, substance abuse, behavioral, crime, etc.) they might have. The aim is to increase their employment rates / hours worked per week and to ensure that as many as possible receive work-focused interventions (i.e. interventions taking place at an ordinary workplace).

 Eligible workers in 17 municipalities are randomized into treatment and control groups since March 1 - 2016 until Dec 31 2016. Data collection will be from admin registers combined with intervention specific registers and will be sent to researcher late 2017/early 2018. "
