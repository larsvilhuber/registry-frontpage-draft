abstract: "We plan a large-scale field experiment to investigates the degree to which the consumption of partisan and low-quality news on Facebook depends on behavioral factors such inertia in decision making and misperceptions about news outlet slant and quality. The experiment is designed to test whether interventions targeting these factors can improve the quality and reduce the partisanship of news consumed on Facebook."
