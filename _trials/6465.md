abstract: "Can digital labour market platforms help match workers with work opportunities, in both formal and informal labour markets? We study this question in the context of Mozambique using a randomized control trial embedded in an (ongoing) tracer study of the school-to-work transitions of graduates from technical and vocational colleges. We implement an encouragement design, using SMS to invite graduates to join different digital platforms: Biscate, which allows individuals to advertise their availability for manual jobs (e.g. hairdresser, mechanic, gardener); and Emprego, which is a more traditional jobs website, where vacancies are posted by organizations. We employ a structural equations
model to estimate the effects of interest, focusing primarily on the contribution of the platforms to employment outcomes as measured after one year."
