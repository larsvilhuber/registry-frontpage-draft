abstract: "we are doing research to develop a spatial intelligence scale for autistic children. our scale is nonverbal having a total of 9 tasks. Autistic children typically excel on the spatial test that measures abstract reasoning such as block design tasks and other tasks. Spatial intelligence is the concept of being able to perceive and derive insight from visual data successfully. This cognitive process is known as an aptitude for understanding visual information in the real and abstract world as well as an innate ability to envision information. People with this spatial ability can usually create effective images that explain concepts and design prototypes that incorporate spatial reasoning. this article includes an introduction to spatial intelligence with its theoretical background and methodology."
