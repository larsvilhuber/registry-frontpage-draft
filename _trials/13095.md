abstract: "Using a randomized controlled study, we will investigate the role of digital application forms, as a potential barrier in the application process for individual health insurance subsidies. For this purpose, all eligible individuals are randomly divided into two groups (digital-only and digital & paper). The aim of this study is to understand the effects of e-government on the application rate for social benefits. The study design allows us to analyze the effects of the digital application barrier for different socio-economic groups on the number of applications and downstream effects on financial outcomes."
