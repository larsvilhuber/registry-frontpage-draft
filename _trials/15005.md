abstract: "We conduct a field experiment in China to incentivize small business owners to become social media content creators. Our primary subsidy is provided as a social media advertisement subsidy for content boosting fees, directly given to the social media platform. This subsidy is conditional upon business owners creating new video, live stream, or photo posts to promote their business. We intend to study the outcomes of revenue, profit and the number of employees after the intervention. We compare the effects with a direct cash transfer. Additionally, we also study whether increased sales enhance small businessesâ€™ likelihood of opening online stores and subsequently accessing fintech credit."
