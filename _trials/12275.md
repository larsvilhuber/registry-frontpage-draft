abstract: "We propose a pilot experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of demand-side interventions in reducing bushmeat consumption in Kinshasa, the capital city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The primary experiment involves randomly showing half of subjects a video discouraging bushmeat consumption (treatment group) and half of subjects a video unrelated to bushmeat consumption (control group). All subjects receive a coupon to their restaurant of choice. We observe what subjects order for the purpose of testing whether treated subjects are less likely to order bushmeat than control subjects. A secondary experiment aims to estimate the elasticity of bushmeat consumption with respect to the price of Moambe Chicken (a common chicken dish). We perform this secondary experiment by randomly paying some restaurants to reduce the price of Moambe Chicken, and observing daily restaurant-by-dish sales. "
