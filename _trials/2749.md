abstract: "To what degree do prosocial incentives interact with the necessary effort (real or chosen) needed to complete a task? In this companion experiment to "CSR and Coordination", I investigate the impact that real effort provision may have on individual and group coordination outcomes following provision of prosocial (or extrinsic) incentives. Prior research has mostly measured coordination outcomes through "effort choice", where individual choice of effort does not require any significant physical or mental exertion.   This study examines the impact of real effort on coordination outcomes through adapting a summation task from Niederle and Vesterlund (2007) and paying participants based on the minimum correct summations performed in their group."
