abstract: "This document describes the research design and analysis strategy of our field experiment, designed to boost training and employment of job-seekers. We start with a detailed outline of the intervention, which takes place in 2022 and 2023 in the state of Lower Austria (Nieder√∂sterreich) in Austria. Job-seekers receive an email newsletter with information on training programs offered by the public employment service and open vacancies within two treatment arms. The newsletter includes a voucher framing that informs about the range of available training programs and signals their monetary value to job-seekers. The intervention builds on a precursor study that took place in 2021 (https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/7141) and expands the most effective treatments to a wider population over an entire year. The major refinement consists in targeting the information on training and job vacancies to the educational attainment of job-seekers. We provide a detailed discussion of our sample selection, variables used and the handling of the data to make the analysis as transparent and replicable as possible. We report the outcomes of our stratified randomization. Further, we state our hypotheses and outcomes of interest motivated by our precursor study and the active labor market policy evaluation literature. Finally, we conclude by specifying our statistical approach to inference."
