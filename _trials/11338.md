abstract: "We propose to design, implement and evaluate a digital educational intervention to promote better financial planning for retirement among adult Hispanics who are currently working and have access to a retirement account through their employer. This pilot study will be the first to test a digital educational program to promote planning for retirement  among adult Hispanics using culturally tailored educational material to address the informational needs of this group.

The specific aims of this intervention are:
1.	Design a digital educational intervention that incorporates behavioral economics principles in order to encourage Hispanics to begin or increase saving for retirement
2.	Implement a pilot test of this digital educational intervention in order to determine the effect on the primary outcomes of retirement knowledge and saving, as well as the secondary outcomes of financial self-efficacy and engagement with digital program.

Participants will be invited to review material in the website https://www.icanretire.com/, which is hosted by the Capital Group.
