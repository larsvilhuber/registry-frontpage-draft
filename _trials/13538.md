abstract: "We study the use of generative AI to produce and screen the CVs and cover letters of job
applicants. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) – such as OpenaAI’s ChatGPT –
there has been a proliferation of websites offering CV generation services for job seekers, and
CV screening services for employers. At the same time, a growing literature has shown that
language models learn stereotyped and biased representations of men and women (Bordia
and Bowman, 2019; Lucy and Bamman, 2021), which can lead them to produce heavily biased
reference letters, for instance (Wan et al., 2023). Building on this recent evidence, we intend to
run a series of pre-registered online experiments to assess the potential consequences of these
production and screening services of CVs and cover letters in the labor market."
