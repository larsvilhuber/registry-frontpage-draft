abstract: "Ethnic discrimination is a global and persistent phenomenon, but much research is needed to understand the mechanism behind differential treatment (Bertrand & Duflo, 2017). In this project, we perform a large-scale field experiment in Germany with a twofold aim. 

First, we aim to analyze if ethnic discrimination changes when individuals try accessing different sports clubs, namely football, tennis, shooting, handball, golf, horse riding, and table tennis. We contact coaches via email asking to join a trial training with a native- or a foreign-sounding name. The emails are identical, and the response rate to the different groups can provide evidence of discrimination. The experimental design is very similar to previous field experiments we performed in several European countries (Gomez-Gonzalez et al., 2021). 

Second, we aim to identify how the intersection of ethnicity with socioeconomic status influences the response rate. The signal mentions the cost of membership fees to test the influence of conflict theory, which is highly debated in the literature (Putnam, 2007). 

For this we contact amateur clubs in the following sports: football, tennis, shooting, handball, golf, horse riding, and tabletennis"
