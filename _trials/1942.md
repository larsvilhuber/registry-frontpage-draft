abstract: "Researchers conduct a randomized field experiment in fifty public schools, where students, parents, and teachers were rewarded with financial incentives for mastering mathematics objectives. On outcomes for which researchers provided direct incentives, there were large and statistically significant treatment effects. These behaviors translated into increases in math achievement and decreases in reading achievement. Two full years after removing the incentives, students with high baseline test scores have statistically positive treatment effects in math and no deleterious impact on reading achievement. In stark contrast, students with low baseline test scores show no impacts in math and statistically negative effects in reading. To better understand these findings, researchers develop and calibrate a multi-period, multitask principal-agent model in which neither the principal nor the agent knows the mapping from actions to outputs, and there can be learning and dynamic complementarities through cumulative knowledge."
