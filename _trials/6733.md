abstract: "We propose to study whether information on regional wage differentials affects internal migration intentions and choices in two African countries. The information treatment is embedded in surveys of participants in employment and income promoting programs in Ghana and Uganda. We randomly assign participants to an information treatment group and a no-intervention control group. Interviews are conducted in person in Ghana and by phone in Uganda. In Ghana, treatment group participants are shown a map of the countryâ€™s ten regions, which depicts the monthly per capita income in each region. In Uganda, treatment group participants are told how much the monthly median wage is in each region and how many times more or less that is in comparison to the median monthly wage in their region of residence. Our two primary outcomes are the extent to which participants would like to move to another domestic region and their internal migration destination choices."
