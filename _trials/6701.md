abstract: "This experiment will use exploration sampling to test the effects of weekly text messaging to parents' phones as a means to increase student use of a phone quiz platform and ultimately learning outcomes. 

The study will be implemented by a partner organization that operates private schools in Lagos, Nigeria, among approximately 4705 students in Primaries 1-6. The study will proceed in two stages. In the first stage, we will use adaptive treatment assignment with exploration sampling and stratification to choose one out of four "types" of text messages. Designed by the partner, the four message "types" include motivational framing, testimonial framing, and varying numbers of practice quizzes tailored to what the student recently covered in class. The text message type chosen in the first stage is the one that promises to lead to the greatest increase in use by students of the partner's quiz platform. In the second stage, we will use a standard RCT with a treatment group that receives the message type chosen in the first stage, and a control group that receives no messaging, to test whether quiz use leads to sustained increases in exam scores."
