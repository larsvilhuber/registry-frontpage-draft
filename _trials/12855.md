abstract: "Emotions can be overwhelming and result in aggressive and uncooperative behaviour, especially when we have no appropriate strategy to deal with them. We evaluate a school-based programme, Surfeel, which teaches primary school children socio-emotional skills, enabling them to find appropriate strategies to cope with uncomfortable situations through verbalisation. We hypothesise that the implementation of the programme will result in a less aggressive learning environment which will improve children’s educational outcomes. To test this, we will first look at reported bullying incidents in treated classes. Secondly, we will investigate how children’s grades evolve over the course of the programme. Last, we will collect pre and post treatment data in treated and control classes about the children's abilities to recognize and express emotions; their feelings in class; through surveys as well as drawings.
