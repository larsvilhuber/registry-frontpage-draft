abstract: "Improving procurement practices is crucial for increasing government efficiency because public procurement consumes 12 per cent of the global GDP (Bosio et al., 2022). Moreover, governments increasingly adopt digital platforms to procure goods and services, generating vast datasets as a byproduct. Despite the increasing adoption of early warning alarms in public procurement, whether and how these artificial intelligence tools increase government efficiency remains an open question. Using the Brazilian public sector as a laboratory, we randomly allocate messages reporting the presence of indications of passive waste in procurement documents to managers and quantify their effect on procurement outcomes."
