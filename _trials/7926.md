abstract: "The main project objective is to increase voluntary tax compliance on tax returns completed by return preparers through education and outreach. Specifically, the project aims to inform the content included in the Letter 5025 that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) sends to return preparers during the pre-filing season as part of their tiered strategy to improve the accuracy of claiming certain benefits. The Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) at the U.S. General Services Administration and the Research Applied Analytics and Statistics (RAAS) and Wage and Investment (W&I) divisions of the IRS collaborated to design and evaluate an updated “Behavioral Insights” (BI) Letter 5025. The primary analysis will compare outcomes for return preparers randomly assigned to one of three pre-filing season groups: (a) sent the updated BI Letter 5025, (b) sent the Treatment-as-Usual (TAU) Letter 5025, (c) sent no letter (or other pre-filing season treatment)."
