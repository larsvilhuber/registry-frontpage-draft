abstract: "Studies have found that the ``graduation'' model can be
  effective in alleviating the constraints that prevent extremely poor
  households from increasing their productivity and income.  This
  consists of a sizable transfer of productive physical capital
  coupled with training and coaching over the course of one or two
  years.  Related, there is evidence that a simpler program of
  unconditional cash transfers (UCT's) may also improve household
  productivity and welfare.  Our field experiment provides a
  comparison of these two approaches to transferring wealth to
  low-income households during the first two years of BRAC's
  ultra-poor pilot project in South Sudan.  We consider the effect of
  each program on productive and financial assets, income, and
  consumption.  We find evidence that both types of transfer have
  positive effects on consumption, but only in the short-run.  We find
  a persistent increase in asset stocks, but only from the graduation
  program.  We also consider the graduation program's effect on
  households' responses to the outbreak of violence in 2014 civil war,
  and elicit suggestive evidence that BRAC's support may have helped
  the beneficiaries to cope with the short-term economic effects of
  the violence."
