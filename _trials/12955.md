abstract: "Climate change threatens smallholder farmers' agricultural production and food security in the Global South, and agroecological practices are a promising adaptation strategy. AgrImpact aims to determine the effectiveness of farmer field schools in supporting farmers to apply agroecological practices in the short term, using a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The initiative will conduct an RCT of the GIZ project PrAda II, using farmer field schools to support adopting these practices. The FFS target five value chains: pepper, cloves, honey, coffee, and vanilla. Farmers will be randomly assigned to a treatment or control condition in each area, and a sub-sample of these farmers will be surveyed both before and after the intervention. The results will be used to evaluate the suitability of farmer field schools in supporting farmers to adopt these more complex practices, as well as indicating short-term barriers,  providing a scientific basis for decision-making on interventions to support the adoption of agroecological practices.
