abstract: "This study aims to provide an explanation for why many information campaigns fail to affect decision-making. In a large randomized field experiment, we aim to show that a large information intervention about a profitable and climate-friendly household investment has limited effects if it only provides generic data. In contrast, it is expected to cause households to make new investments when it follows a campaign strategy designed to minimize information processing costs. These predictions are consistent with a model of selective attention, where individuals prioritize information that they believe is valuable after accounting for the costs of attending to the data that arise due to limited mental energy and time. We also examine and discuss the role of selective attention relative to other possible channels for the effect of the campaign strategies. "
