abstract: "Farm labor shortages (i.e., unfilled labor needs), despite high levels of underemployment, in many Sub-Saharan African countries present a paradox. This paper will investigate one possible explanation: the asymmetry of wage information in rural labor markets, which contributes to inaccurate wage expectations and, in turn, farm labor mismatches and shortages. Using a crowd-sourced information experiment, we will investigate how aggregate wage information provision affects labor market outcomes, such as wages, farm labor supply, and labor shortages. "
