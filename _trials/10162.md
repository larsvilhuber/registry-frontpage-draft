abstract: "We are collaborating with a leading financial institution in Singapore to experiment with different ways of encouraging its account holders (clients) who regularly purchase gasoline to adopt electric vehicles (EV). The experiments involve four information treatments including a control group, whereby we provide up-to-date information in various forms. These include the private benefits of EV ownership, the social benefits of EV ownership, and salient information about financial incentives of EV adoption that the financial institution already provides to the general public. The information experiments will be implemented by the financial institution among 32,000 clients and is expected to last 14 weeks, from October 2022 to January 2023. Through our employer (National University of Singapore), we signed a Research Collaboration Agreement with the financial institution on August 17, 2022, which "regulates (our) collaboration in relation to the research project entitled 'EV (Energy Reset) Adoption'" and includes a detailed work plan and project schedule. The final milestone is to produce a research article that is published in a scientific journal.
