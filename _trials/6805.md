abstract: "The goal of this study is to validate a new method for eliciting individual time preferences presented in an earlier study (AEARCTR-0005115). In theory, the method we proposed (“Multiple Lottery Lists”) is robust to variation in background consumption that may arise over time, while other methods are not. In this study, we will test whether the estimated time preferences parameters correlate with behaviors that are inter-temporal in nature such as saving and health-related behaviors, and with personality characteristics. To do this, we will collect additional data on the same samples as in the first study. "
