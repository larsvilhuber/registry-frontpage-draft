abstract: "The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated economic and social impacts have increased parental stress and {\color{black}{concern about a potential rise in}} child maltreatment. School closures and reduced access to social care services make the situation even more precarious for at-risk children. In this context, designing accessible digital tools that help reduce stress and improve household functioning is essential to improving parents' ability to cope with stress as well as to reduce abuse and its negative consequences on child development.  Using an individual-level randomized control trial design with 3,103 caregivers, we assess the impact of a free high-dosage intervention delivered over three months to parents residing with children aged eight years or younger in El Salvador. The messages contain information, exercises, videos, and links to a blog with additional content, which caregivers can access on-demand. This pre-analysis plan outlines the evaluation plans of the research project that aims to estimate the causal effect of a mobile phone intervention providing parental stress management and positive parenting techniques on parental stress, depression, anxiety, and impulsivity in the context of parenting. In addition, we also examine the effects of the intervention on the quality of parent-child interactions including time spent in child care provision, the adoption of positive parenting, and attitudes about child maltreatment."
