abstract: "Whenever parents make decisions that do not reflect their children’s preferences, they
have previously been presumed to do so because of preference misalignment. We posit a
new explanation: Parents hold inaccurate beliefs about their children’s preferences despite
valuing such information. We will test this hypothesis and demonstrate the economic relevance of such misinformation
through a field experiment in the high-stakes context of the centralized high school application
process in Bulgaria. We design
an informational intervention that conveys children’s preferences in a transparent way:
we share with parents their child’s personal ranking of schools. We will first measure whether parents are indeed misinformed about their
children's preferences, as well as the extent and nature of such misinformation (e.g., specific school tracks/profiles parents are misinformed about). We will then empirically study whether the intervention
leads to children's final school assignment being closer to their stated ranking. "
