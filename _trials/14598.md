abstract: "Most people instinctively chase losses, hoping to recover themâ€”a behavior called myopic loss aversion, where we focus on immediate losses over long-term gains. Our study explored whether groups show this same bias using an investment game. Participants played individually and in pairs across two scenarios: one group faced their losses after each round, while the other continued without directly confronting losses. All participants first played alone, making investment choices with real money at stake, then played in pairs with collective decision-making. We expect to find myopic loss aversion in both individual and group settings, though with varying intensity."
