abstract: "Sexual violence’s victims face negative consequences, both physical and psychological, that could last throughout their lifetime. Despite their severity, sexual crimes are usually underreported because victims are afraid, are being pressured by their offenders or simply because they lack the relevant information about the process or do not trust the justice system. Furthermore, cases that are effectively reported tend to be poorly managed and are frequently influenced by social prejudices that can bias the prosecutorial processes. To our knowledge, there is limited empirical evidence about the effectiveness of different strategies aimed at improving the investigation and judicial process through training focused on reducing biases and pre-conception on the part of the prosecutors. Along with the Office of the Attorney General, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact on the investigation process of sexual cases of a training workshop ("Taller de socialización del “Protocolo de investigación y judicialización de violencia sexual”) for Colombian prosecutors. The workshop is part of an initiative led by the Office of the Attorney General aimed at improving the quality and outcomes of sexual crimes cases by providing prosecutors with tools to overcome technical and investigative obstacles in an unbiased and victim-centered way."
