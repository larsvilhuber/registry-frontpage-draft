abstract: "Previous studies have shown that women tend to set lower goals for themselves compared to men, resulting in lower performance. In this paper we test whether providing incentives better fitted for motivating women to set high goals could lower the performance gap. We designed an online experiment where participants were asked to set their goals and perform a real effort task. An incentive mechanism that relied on contributing to charity upon participants achieving their goals resulted in women setting higher goals for themselves than men, reducing gender differences in performance."
