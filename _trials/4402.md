abstract: "In this study, we investigate whether people use curiosity in a strategic manner to justify dishonest behavior. Specifically, we propose that individuals experiencing a want-should conflict will be motivated to acquire information that can serve as a potential justification to act in line with their temptations. Just as people might be strategically ignorant, we propose that people also have a tendency to acquire non-instrumental information for the sake of justifying their own selfishness - we call this "strategic curiosity". As such, we conjecture that people are not merely passive receivers of information but that they shape their information environment to serve their self-interest. To test our predictions, we conduct a digital version of the die-under-the-cup task, where subjects roll a virtual die and report the outcome for monetary rewards. In this controlled setting, we experimentally manipulate the availability of superfluous information and whether this information has the potential to justify dishonesty. Our manipulations focus on mainly two directions: how many times the die can be rolled and the outcome of the die. This study can have a wide range of practical implications and can open up a strand of research that focuses on understanding how people actively shape their information environment to serve their own self-interest.
