abstract: "This project’s objective is to investigate determinants of persistent overtreatment with antimalarials and to identify policies to reduce overtreatment. Overuse of medical care is often attributed to the problem of “induced demand” by an informed expert: the doctor, who is better informed than the patient, can steer demand and potentially lead patients to buy more than they would if they had the same information as the doctor. This can occur for several reasons: the doctor may have a financial interest in selling expensive treatments, but may also evaluate costs and benefits of treatment differently. For example, the doctor may not take into account the financial burden to the patient and only evaluate the medical aspects, or may even interpret the diagnostic evidence wrongly. On the other hand, it has been argued that patients in developing countries “demand” more powerful and expensive treatment than is really necessary, perhaps out of an excess confidence in “Western” drugs. We aim to understand if overprescription is driven by induced demand from doctors, or real (over)demand from patients, or both. The project will also study how doctor beliefs about the accuracy of diagnostic tests determine prescription decisions.
