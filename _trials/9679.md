abstract: "In recent years, false and misleading news has proliferated online, especially on social media. The effects of this trend may be especially pernicious when policymakers themselves fall prey to untrustworthy information and amplify it. In this study, we test whether exposure to a training workshop on the dangers of misinformation and how to recognize it helps deputy ministers and tax officers in Pakistan to better distinguish between false or misleading news and legitimate news and reduces the extent to which they would share false or misleading news online."
