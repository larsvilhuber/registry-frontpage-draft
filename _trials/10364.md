abstract: "The objective of this study is to test whether providing information on the college system and returns to college in a foreign country impacts high school students’ intentions and actual migration to study in that country. We investigate this hypothesis in the context of migration flows of high school graduates from the Republic of Cabo Verde (Cape Verde) --- a small, developing African country --- to Portugal, the most common migration destination from the country. Students in treated schools are shown an informational video on the challenges and opportunities of studying in Portugal, including a comparison to college returns to Cape Verdeans in both countries. The main outcomes of interest are intentions to migrate, steps taken towards study migration, and college applications to Portugal."
