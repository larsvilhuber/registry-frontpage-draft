abstract: "Credible research relies significantly on the quality of data enumerators collect from households. However, evidence suggests that this data can vary based on enumerators’ demographic characteristics, and their skills and behaviors when conducting interviews. Poor data quality can lead to bias and limited validity across contexts. Enumerator skills, especially non-cognitive skills, can be difficult to recognize in a typical recruitment process. However, one’s peers have additional information about their skills, so recruiting through referrals holds the potential to diversify the skills profile of the applicant pool. This study aims to measure the impact of recruiting enumerators through skills-based referrals on data quality. Specifically, it asks if referrals change the skill profile in an enumerator applicant pool. It also asks what the return of two specific skills, active listening and conscientiousness, on data quality is. In the first phase, trusted enumerators identified by the IPA Philippines team will be randomized into referring individuals in their network on the basis of one of the two skills. In the second phase, referred enumerators will in turn be asked to refer individuals on the basis of the skill they were referred on. This will be a supplementary study to the Philippines Socioeconomic Panel Survey (PSPS) which is being implemented by IPA Philippines. "
