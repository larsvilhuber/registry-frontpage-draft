abstract: "We conducted a field experiment in Somali schools, aimed at changing the education aspirations and gender attitudes of male and female students enrolled in elementary schools. Our sample consists of 47 primary and middle schools in four regions which were part of an existing intervention. We randomly selected 22 schools to receive a role model treatment, consisting of a college student visiting the target classrooms. Within each treatment school, we randomly selected some grades to receive a visit from a female role model and some grades to receive a visit from a male role model. The college students talked about their study journeys, their challenges and their strategies to overcome such challenges. Data collected six months after the intervention show a significant and large impact of (only) female role models on boys' and girls' attitudes toward gender equality but no impact on students' aspirations to attend college. We also collected two years after the intervention only for the oldest, graduating cohort of students, who were grade 6 at the time of the intervention. Analysis of the two-year follow up is ongoing.
