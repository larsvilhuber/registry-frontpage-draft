abstract: "n Western countries, a gender gap in quantitative subjects in university and STEM-related1
jobs is well documented (e.g. Chen and Luo, 2022 and Ross et al., 2012). There is a multitude
of factors driving the gender gap; in this study we focus on the role of exams. Exam
performance is a major factor in university admission and job allocation. However, the notion
that exams are fair and truly test the abilities they are designed for is more and more called
into question (e.g. Duquennois 2022). There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that
the setting of exams and design of questions can systematically disadvantage socioeconomic
groups.2 Duquennois (2022) shows that students from poor families perform worse if a
question has a financial theme. Building on this result, our study aims to understand if
certain question phrasings systematically disadvantage one gender. By randomly varying
the exam question phrasing, we want to study this."
