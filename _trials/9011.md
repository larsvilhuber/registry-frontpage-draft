abstract: "This experiment is designed to determine whether and how instructors in higher education respond to monitoring, and how those changes affect student outcomes. Substantial research over the last two decades has established the importance of instructor quality in determining the outcomes of students in K-12 education. Studies employing rich longitudinal data have shown that these differences in instructor quality have implications beyond just contemporaneous test scores; they translate into meaningful differences in long-term life outcomes. For a number of reasons, including the lack of standardized assessments and curricula, large-scale causal evidence around the importance of instructor quality in higher education lags that of K-12 education. However, a few key quasi-experimental studies suggest that instructor quality plays a meaningful role in the college studentsâ€™ success.

While a strong literature exists exploring what practices lead to greater success in the college classroom, little is known about what policies can be implemented at the administrative level to improve classroom practices. We attempt to fill this gap by studying the effects of monitoring and feedback on instructor quality and student outcomes. This study is the first to our knowledge to develop and assess the quality of an in-class observation rubric for higher education. Furthermore, the randomization of student assignment to instructors and instructor assignment to treatment provide further opportunities to test the causal effect of instructors on student performance on standardized tests and in other classes. Finally, the research design directly measures how teacher practices may change over the course of a semester as a result of monitoring and feedback. Lesson schedules are standardized across instructors, as are assignments and due dates. This standardization further allows us to assess changes in student performance directly before and after instructor observations. As a result, the design also allows us to separate how instructors are learning as a result of their feedback as opposed to how they are preparing differently in response to the possibility of an observation.
