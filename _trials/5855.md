abstract: "In 2018, the Indian state of Chhattisgarh distributed over 2 million smartphones to female heads of household. We build a randomized control trial on this phone distribution program to examine multiple research questions focused on gender gaps in technology use, the economic and social impacts of technology adoption, and norms related to womenâ€™s phone use. The RCT leverages three interventions to address the barriers to smartphone use that women face. The first is a basic digital training, designed to build skills women need to engage with phones. The second, a service titled Mor Awaaz, deploys a phone-based use case that is in line with the prevailing norm that women should care for the household. Women enrolled in the service receive weekly phone calls with entertaining, pre-recorded information on good health and nutrition practices and government social assistance programs. Once a month, we survey women on these topics. Additional treatment arms randomize the number of enrollees within villages to understand the role of peers in phone engagement and payment of in-kind incentives to individual enrollees to understand the value of amplifying the economic returns to phone use.
