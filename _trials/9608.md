abstract: "We study the impact of reminders on unsubscriptions from and engagement with The All of Us Research Program (AoURP). While reminders are generally seen as effective in encouraging individuals to complete the requested task, they may also impose an ‘annoyance cost’ on the user (Damgaard and Gravert, 2018 (D&G2018)). This in turn can increase the likelihood that users may unsubscribe from the communication or otherwise disengage from future communication efforts. In this study, we set out to replicate the finding by D&G2018 in a different setting and further analyze the mechanisms through which beliefs about future annoyance costs arise. "
