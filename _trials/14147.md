abstract: "For many families, finding and paying for child care is an impediment to joining the labor force. Previous research has found that an increase in the availability of child care increases maternal labor force participation, and that a decrease in the cost of child care in the form of child care subsidies increases maternal labor force participation. There is intense policy debate about how to best support access to child care for families, with a variety of policy suggestions from providing subsidies to parents, as suggested by the Build Back Better proposal, to giving support directly to child care providers, as was done in the American Rescue Plan Act. Another lever could be encouraging businesses to provide child care benefits to support their workers. Very little work has been done on this topic, and this project aims to provide evidence on the topic of how such benefits may increase the ability of parents to work outside the home and whether parents find these benefits valuable."
