abstract: "The ultimate goal of this project is to determine whether, controlling for other worker characteristics, employers place value on post-baccalaureate certificate receipt.  This will be accomplished through the use of a correspondence study, which consists of sending fictitious résumés to real job postings and comparing how the callback rates differ between those fictitious applicants who have received a post-baccalaureate certificate versus those who have not.  The number of post-baccalaureate certificates granted per year has increased greatly in recent years, with Capuzzi (2012) reporting a 46% increase from 2005 to 2010.  Our study is one of the first to examine the impact of these certificates on the labor market outcomes of recipients, and thus may have important implications in both an academic and policy setting.
