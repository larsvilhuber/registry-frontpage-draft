abstract: "This paper examines individuals' redistributive preferences and the motivations behind them. While the effects of information treatments on inequality perceptions are well established in the literature, how these perceptions translate into redistributive preferences remains unclear. To address this gap in the literature, we use two conjoint experiments and two information treatments. The first conjoint explores preferences for redistributive policies like income tax rates and unemployment benefits, while the second examines preferences for motivational factors for redistribution, such as fairness, efficiency, and the perceived societal impact of inequality. The first treatment exploits the timing of Finland’s Tax Day, with half of respondents surveyed before and half after. On the Tax Day, citizens' tax data is publicly released, and especially top earners' incomes and taxes are widely discussed in the media. The Tax Day is also a combined treatment with the US presidential elections occurring one day before the Tax Day. We thus also assess the impact of US presidential elections on the choice of motivational factors such as trust and inequality’s effects on societal stability. The second treatment randomly assigns respondents to watch an informational video which discusses tax collection, public services funding, and potential downsides of poorly designed tax system. This way, we provide novel insights into how real-life and targeted information interventions influence redistributive preferences and the motivations behind them.
