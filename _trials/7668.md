abstract: "Counteracting misinformation on childhood vaccines remains a priority for
public health in industrialized countries. Previous research showed that
misinformation-induced vaccine hesitancy particularly concerns very highly
or very lowly educated parents, and, especially in Europe, specific groups of
immigrants. Misinformation framing directly targets specific sub-population
of parents by exploiting different cognitive biases, and specific concerns
based on cultural norms: we aim at testing the effectiveness of similar framing
techniques applied to positive information on the HPV vaccine by conducting a stratified
Randomized Controlled Trial in Stockholm, Sweden. We randomize emotionally
and scientifically/statistically framed information addressing the specific
concerns reported by the epidemiological literature, and test whether they improve HPV vaccination uptake and reduce common vaccines misconceptions."
