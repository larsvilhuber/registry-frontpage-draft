abstract: "We test a fundamental assumption underlying the literature on information aggregation and deliberation: that people update their
beliefs when listening to peers. We investigate whether this assumption holds in online deliberation among strangers prior to a ballot on rent control. In a two-wave survey experiment, we collect voting intentions and textual data from chat interactions before the ballot and self-reported votes after the ballot. The study design randomly assigns chat-group compositions. "
