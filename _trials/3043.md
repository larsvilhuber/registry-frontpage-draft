abstract: "It is often argued that payday lending regulations can increase welfare, because people with self-control problems might borrow more than they expect or would like to in the long run. To test this, we ran a field experiment with a large payday lender to elicit borrowers' predictions of their future borrowing and willingness-to-pay for an incentive to avoid future borrowing. We combine the experimental results with a novel sufficient statistic-based approach to estimate a model of partially naive present focus."
