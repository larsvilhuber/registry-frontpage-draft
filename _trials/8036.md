abstract: "In Uganda, the persistence of gender segregated labor markets results in the clustering of women within the least lucrative sectors, a trend that is generally observed in developed and developing countries (World Bank, 2011; Campos et al, 2015; Das; Kotikula, 2019).  The proposed project examines the extent of gender bias perpetuated by employees through the referral system, which is a significant driver behind hiring decisions within informal labor markets. We present employees of businesses operating in highly segregated occupations with profiles of potential candidates to investigate their gender preferences as well as how these preferences interplay with personal connection to the candidate. On a small subsample we use monetary incentives to gain insight into the range of the value that respondents place upon upholding this form of discrimination. We also assess whether information shocks and changes in confidentiality can change the referring preferences of employees over candidates. "
