abstract: "Water scarcity is one of the fundamental challenges facing developing country agriculture.  In South Asia, millions of privately-owned borewells have sprung up in the last two decades, to the point where groundwater has become the largest irrigation source in India, especially vital for dry season cultivation.  While groundwater exploitation has contributed significantly to poverty reduction in rural India, unregulated drilling has also raised concerns about the sustainability of this crucial resource.  Widespread adoption of drip irrigation has been proposed as a promising water-saving solution to the problem of groundwater over-exploitation.  However, there is little, if any, rigorous evidence on the benefits, both in terms of agricultural production and potential water savings, of drip irrigation.

We implement a randomized control trial, in which a treatment group of borewell owners was encouraged to participate in a government subsidy program to adopt drip irrigation against a control group that kept the status quo. The study will track agricultural production, farm income, and water use in both groups before and after drip adoption.
