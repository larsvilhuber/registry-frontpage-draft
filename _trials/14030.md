abstract: "The intervention aims to reduce employee turnover by enhancing new employees' identification with the company through a targeted onboarding intervention. Specifically, within two regions of a large German retail company, we will randomly implement a modification to the current onboarding process. In the treated districts, store managers will be asked to organize a brief welcome event to strengthen the new employees’ identification with the company. We hypothesize that this increased identification will lead to reduced turnover among new hires. To study underlying behavioral mechanisms we will run surveys among the newly hired employees as well as the store managers."
