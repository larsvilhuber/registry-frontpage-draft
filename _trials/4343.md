abstract: "Economic theory predicts that forecasts are an important determinant of welfare. In developing countries, however, agents may have difficulty forming accurate, precise forecasts because of limited information and human capital. This plausibly limits the scope for optimal responses to uncertain future events. We study the effect of two randomized interventions on forecast formation and behavioral responses. The first is the provision of day-ahead air pollution forecasts. The second is training in forecasting techniques aimed at reducing behavioral biases. We estimate impacts on forecast error in air pollution and travel times. Measured responses include willingness to pay for protective face masks and changes in time use. We examine effects on proxies for the variance of utility, which broadly reflects forecasting and responses to uncertainty. Finally we elicit willingness to pay for our forecasts, an important input to cost-benefit analysis of air pollution monitoring. "
