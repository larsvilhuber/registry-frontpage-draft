abstract: "Dockless bike-sharing is a very popular short-distance commuting service among city dwellers. The Hellobike company is a large supplier of such services. It taps over 450 university markets, where some shared bicycles only serve students and exclusively circulate on university campuses. In this study, we design and implement several treatments that vary the extent to which an appeal is made to usersâ€™ considerations for other users and to infer the role social preferences play in bike-sharing. In a field experiment, we compare four treatments: a feedback treatment, one that involves social comparisons, an individual free-ticket treatment, and a group free-ticket treatment."
