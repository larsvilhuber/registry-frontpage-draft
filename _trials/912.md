abstract: "Access to electricity is considered both an outcome and a driver of development. Most households in rural sub-Saharan Africa and over 90% of households in rural Kenya are not connected to the grid. These households typically rely on kerosene lanterns with high operational costs and low-quality light. Prices for solar power have fallen dramatically, raising the possibility that solar energy could provide an alternative to kerosene, especially for lightning needs. This may allow households to save on energy expenditure, increase the time household members can spend on productive activities, and improve safety, as well as health and schooling outcomes. Solar lights have therefore attracted the attention of investors, entrepreneurs, donors, NGOs, and governments. Still, solar lights only provide minimal access to energy and despite the high hopes for this technology, there is little empirical evidence of its cost-effectiveness, its impact on household welfare, or its potential effect on the environment. Even less is known about what drives adoption of solar energy and solar lightning, in particular. The proposed randomized field experiment aims to better understand current demand for solar lights and constraints to adoption, as well as the lanternsâ€™ impact on rural households, focusing on their effect on energy expenditures, light use, time use, as well as health, education, safety, and happiness."
