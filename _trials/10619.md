abstract: "People with intellectual and developmental disabilities (PIDs) in Spain suffer from much lower labor force participation and much larger unemployment rates than people without these disabilities. The aim of this study is to obtain causal evidence on the advantage of using the customized employment methodology (CEM) in the Spanish context compared to the traditional methodology implemented by the Confederación Plena inclusión España (PI) so far, to foster social inclusion of PIDs. We will measure the impact of the CEM on labor market outcomes, social inclusion, and wellbeing. The randomized control trial will allocate 502 PIDs who are currently enrolled with PI into two groups: one receiving the CEM (treatment group) and the other receiving the traditional methodology (control group). By identifying what the PID has to offer the labor market and what potential employers need, we expect that the CEM will create new job opportunities and help overcome barriers that PIDs face when job searching, increasing their labor force participation and job retention, and improving their quality of life and social inclusion."
