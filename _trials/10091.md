abstract: "We use a randomized control trial with around 2000 students in 110 schools in Kenya. We study whether a soft skill intervention of â€œgoal setting," that teaches students in their penultimate year of primary school how to set academic goals, improves learning outcomes on year-end exams. Students in treatment schools receive the goal setting intervention which consists of 25 lesson of 35 minutes each. We aim to answer the following questions: 1) To what extent does a goal setting intervention have an impact on improving learning outcomes (i.e., test scores on year-end exams)?; 2) To what extent are there gender differences in the impacts of a goal setting intervention on learning outcomes?, and 3) Are there any adverse impacts of the intervention on sub-populations (e.g. gender, low/high-performance) of students?"
