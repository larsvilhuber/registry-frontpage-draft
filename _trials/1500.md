abstract: "This experiment is an attempt to understand how urban noise experienced by people in the developing world affects worker productivity, cognitive function, and decision-making. Participants will be recruited to attend a short training course at the Technology Development Centre (TDC) of the Kenyan National Industrial Training Authority. During each of the training sessions, participants will be randomly assigned to produce a practice good in one of two rooms. Then one of the rooms will have noise added using equipment on-site at the TDC. Worker productivity and cognitive performance will be measured during each session, and workers will engage in real-stakes decisions at the end of selected days. Finally, at the end of the training period, participants' willingness to pay for quiet will be elicited. 

An additional second experiment was conducted following the design of the first, but using only cognitive assessments and an effort task as the outcomes of interest."
