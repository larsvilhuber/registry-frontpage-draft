abstract: "The newspaper coverage of company board members is highly gendered. In particular, more family-related language is used in newspaper articles on female CEOs compared to male CEOs of publicly listed companies in Germany. This is in line with gender stereotypes and traditional gender roles associating women with family and a caregiver role, and men with careers and a main breadwinner role. In a randomized online experiment, we ask whether the stereotypical representation of CEOs in newspapers affects individuals' beliefs about manager and firm performance, and resulting financial decision-making. We show participants articles consisting of elements from real newspaper coverage on a real company and its CEO. We vary whether information about the CEO's family or a tradeoff between family and career is mentioned in the articles, hereby varying the way male and female CEOs are portrayed related to gender stereotypes. Subsequently, participants are asked several questions on (incentivized) outcomes related to beliefs about firm performance, investment into stocks of the firm, beliefs about CEO performance in an employee ranking, and the CEO's `survival' in the firm. In unincentivized questions, they are further asked to explain the reasoning behind their answers."
