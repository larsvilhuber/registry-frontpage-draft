abstract: "This paper studies whether cognitive load affects time preferences through the channel of time perception. Experimental studies on the effect cognitive load has on time preferences show mixed results. According to dual system theory being under cognitive load while making decisions reduces the efficiency of the logical but slow system 2 in the brain, leading to a poorer system 2 decisions and more frequent use of the impulsive and fast system 1. This should lead to more impatient decisions, both because imagining the far future requires more cognitive power than imagining periods of time closer to the present, and because decisions governed by system 1 are probably highly present biased. However, digging deeper into the mechanisms coupled to cognitive load in the psychology literature, it has been shown that being under cognitive load is related to the shrinking of subjective time related to objective time. Given the assumption that time preferences are formed over subjective time, the shrinking of subjective time under cognitive load results in more patience in objective terms, assuming that time preferences over subjective time are fix. Hence, the effect of altered time perception under cognitive load goes in the opposite direction to the dual system theory effect, which might explain the mixed result in the experimental literature on the subject.

This study tests whether the effect of cognitive load on time preferences goes via the two proposed mechanisms. We conduct an experimental study where (i) the prospective time perception (ii) cognitive performance and (iii) time preferences are tested, all under varying degree of cognitive load induced by Stroop tasks. Our hypothesis is that increasing cognitive load decreases the ratio of subjective time to objective time, impairs performance on the cognitive performance task and that the sum of these two effects determines the total effect of cognitive load on time preferences.


In order to ensure identification and strengthen the temporal link between prospective time perception over a very short period of time and time preferences measured over a long period of time we perform a second experiment where changes in cognitive performance, time perception, time preferences as well as in future perspective (estimated by a scrambled sentence task) are induced with varying degree of arousal induced by external tempo.
