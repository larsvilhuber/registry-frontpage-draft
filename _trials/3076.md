abstract: "This Impact Evaluation studies to which extent procurement through PAE Framework Agreements impacts the quality, value-for-money, and delivery of school meals to students in Colombia. This study will perform a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the impact of replacing such existing ad-hoc agreements between individual ETCs (subnational education districts) and ‘fundaciones’  with centrally-coordinated, standardized, and credibly-enforced framework agreement contracts. Additionally, as the involvement of school-level actors in the administration of contracts may play a role in determining the effectiveness of service delivery, this evaluation will also assess the impact of bottom-up accountability mechanisms by empowering teachers, parents, and students to enforce the terms of contracts on suppliers.  A randomized cross-design combining PAE Framework Agreements with client empowerment will attempt to determine whether supply- and/or demand-side interventions targeted at improving delivery have an impact on value-for-money and service delivery.
