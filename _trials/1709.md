abstract: "The Iranian organ market is unique: it matches those who have kidneys they are willing to donate with those who need them, but also allows for the sale of those kidneys. The NGO which administers the market and the medical procedures involved in the transplantation have granted us access to patients prior to their operations and repeated interaction with them in the months that follow. We would like to use this opportunity to investigate the motivations of patients (and should have access to those who decide to donate and those who do not): in particular, to test both the degree of habituation to both the health and financial ramifications of the procedure and the extent to which that habituation is correctly anticipated by patients over a period of several months (before and after the procedure). This will be combined with a tests designed to tease out plausible controls, confounds or corroborating factors (such as risk preference, patience levels, reported subjective well-being, personality traits, planning aptitude and cognitive ability) as well as demographic, personal and employment data on the individuals. We are also hoping to compare key characteristics of the group of donors with a control group of a similar socio-economic background."
