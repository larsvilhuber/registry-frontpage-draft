abstract: "Can social signaling incentivize pregnant women to attend antenatal care services and give birth with a trained provider? Working with the Ministry of Health and Sanitation Sierra Leone, I introduce a social incentive in the form of differently colored bracelets. Pregnant women receive bracelets when they come  for antenatal care and when they deliver with a trained health provider. The differently colored bracelets make highly salient if the antenatal care schedule is unfinished and if other women have attended visits that you missed. Unlike  most incentives, which are material or private in nature (e.g. food, cash transfers), the bracelets make the decision to attend antenatal care and deliver safely observable, allowing pregnant women to signal to others that they look after their own and their babyâ€™s health. I implement a field experiment in government clinics to test the effects of the social incentive on timely and complete antenatal care and delivery with a trained health provider. I further measure the effect of the bracelets on individuals' knowledge and beliefs about others' pregnancy care choices. I vary the visibility of pregnancy care decisions across treatment arms by implementing different variations of the bracelet scheme. This experimental design allows me to separately identify the extent to which behavior change is driven by a demand for bracelets or reminder effects, or for a desire to signal to others.
