abstract: "This randomized control trial aims to evaluate the impact of performance bonuses and 1:1 meetings with team leaders on performance metrics, retention, and job satisfaction among call center agents working remotely. The study involves two treatment arms: one with performance bonuses only and another with both performance bonuses and bi-weekly 1:1 meetings. The study will involve 900 agents, split equally across treatment arms and a control group, with randomization conducted at the individual level. The trial will track agent productivity, retention, and job satisfaction over six months."
