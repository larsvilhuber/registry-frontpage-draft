abstract: "In a fragmented healthcare system, efforts to change a physicianâ€™s practice patterns for the publicly insured may have implications for healthcare delivery that go beyond just the targeted physicians and insurers. Specifically, these efforts could change how physicians treat privately insured patients, and they could also influence the practice patterns of other physicians through peer effects. In this work, we aim to generate credible estimates of these spillovers by exploiting a randomized intervention that sought to reduce antipsychotic prescribing to publicly insured older and disabled adults. The original trial sent letters to high volume prescribers of the antipsychotic quetiapine in Medicare. The letters contained a peer comparison message and warned prescribers that they were under review by Medicare, and they reduced antipsychotic prescribing to Medicare patients by 16% over two years. We will estimate two spillovers. First, using commercial insurance data, we will estimate the effect of the letters on antipsychotic prescribing in private insurance, a within-prescriber spillover. Second, using Medicare data linked to practice and referral data, we will estimate the effect on antipsychotic prescribing by peers of the original study physicians, a between-prescriber spillover."
