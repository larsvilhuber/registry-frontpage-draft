abstract: "How resources should be redistributed among members in society is a topic of debate. A clear normative benchmark is available only in a few situations, but more often, different allocations can be justified by appealing to different moral arguments. Such a plurality of moral arguments results in moral wiggle room because it provides excuses to people to act, consciously or unconsciously, in a way that favors themselves or that is socially undesirable.  We study whether the availability of moral wiggle room affects discriminatory behavior against immigrants. 
We run experiments on representative samples of individuals from the native majority in Germany and France. The individuals decide how to redistribute money between two other people living in their country; one of these is from the majority as well and the other person has an ethnic minority background. They make their decision either in a context in which splitting money equally is obviously the fairest choice, or in a context in which deviating from an equal split is possible because the normative benchmark is not unique. We hypothesize that individuals with a taste for ethnic discrimination find it easier to allocate a lower amount of money to the minority worker than to the majority worker in a context in which the normative benchmark is not unique.
