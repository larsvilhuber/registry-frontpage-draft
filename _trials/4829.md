abstract: "While much research in economics has studied the implications of environmental taxation for income inequality, research about the perceived justice of carbon pricing reforms is scarce. In this paper, we analyze the importance of preferences about justice on the support for carbon prices and its interaction with revenue recycling schemes using a discrete-choice experiment with randomized information treatments. We illustrate different fairness conceptions in a representative sample covering about 6,000 German household heads and measure the effect on the acceptability of a carbon tax."
