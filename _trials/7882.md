abstract: "The aims of this project are to empirically investigate a) cognitive dissonance avoidance by a change in behavior to comply with the own moral principles, b) cognitive dissonance avoidance by a change in beliefs or the suppression of knowledge, c) pro-social behavior as self-signaling. To this end, we conduct a survey among 4,000 individuals and elicit their attitudes towards sustainable production. Embedded in the survey is a discrete choice task in which respondents can decide on whether they prefer to win a voucher worth 20 euros from either amazon or the sustainable online marketplace memolife. To elicit revealed preferences by inducing incentive-compatible response behavior, one out of 20 respondents can win a voucher by chance, thereby avoiding hypothetical bias. To cause or exacerbate cognitive dissonance, we use two information treatments in which either immediately before or directly after their voucher decision half of the 4,000 respondents are reminded of their previously stated attitude towards sustainable production, while the other half of the participants receives information on criticism about conventional online shopping."
