abstract: "We study the impact of low gender diversity in introductory economics classes on student performance, reported classroom experience, and the subsequent decision to major in economics. We randomize the gender composition of teaching assistant-led sections in introductory economics courses at a large, public university in the U.S. Students are randomly assigned to “more diverse,” “less diverse,” and “status quo” sections in which the fraction of women varies from around 10 to 80%. Main outcomes are students’ grades and future choices including enrollment in other economics courses and declaring economics as a major. We test different mechanisms mediating the treatment effects such as students’ perceptions of the climate in the classroom and heterogeneity by student and section variables. "
