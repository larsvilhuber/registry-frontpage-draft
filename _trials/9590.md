abstract: "Observational data suggests that human mobility (migration and commuting) drops off discretely at state borders. This online survey experiment will test if state borders have a causal effect on people's stated preference to move, holding other features of the potential destination constant and separate from the effect of maintaining/severing social ties to friends and family. In addition, by experimentally manipulating income differences associated with the move, I can back out people's willingness to pay to avoid moving across state lines and determine the economic cost of state borders."
