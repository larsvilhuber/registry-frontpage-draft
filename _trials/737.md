abstract: "The study aims to test the impact of two interventions designed to affect the decision to purchase improved cookstoves. In order to test the impact of the interventions, a sample of participants from Kibera, a large slum in Nairobi, were randomly selected into two treatment groups and one control group. All groups were subjected to personality tests and information was also collated on various demographic attributes prior to the treatments to allow determination of the causal effect of each treatment. At the end of the session respondents were all offered the option to purchase a cook stove in a lottery setting designed to establish the willingness to pay for a cook stove for each respondent. The two treatment groups were designed to test the impact of scarcity and as- pirations on the cook stove purchase decision. The control group received market- ing information about the benefits of improved cookstoves. The second and third treatment groups received the same marketing information in addition to another treatment. The second treatment group followed the format of the control except that participants were told that the number of cookstoves available for purchase was limited in order to generate a feeling of scarcity. The third treatment group received ‘aspirational’ thinking priming. Respondents were induced into an ‘aspirational mind-set’ through the use of spoken narratives. Further to testing the impact of the abovementioned interventions, the study also aims to test the impact of scarcity on participation rates in a health related information session.
