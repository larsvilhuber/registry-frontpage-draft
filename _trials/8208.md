abstract: "This study intends to replicate Mayraz (2018) and potentially extend treatment conditions. The main part of the study includes showing subjects 20 what price scenarios and asking experiment participants to predict the future true prices. Subjects are compensated with $8.00 and by accurately (within a pre-specified interval) predicting the true price they can earn an additional $10.00 reward.  Similar to Mayraz (2018), we will have Farmers and Bakers treatments.  In addition to that, we will also add the Neutral condition with introducing any role.
