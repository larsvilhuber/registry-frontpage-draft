abstract: "Based on our study “Subjective Stress, Autonomy, and Incentives” (AEARCTR-0003532) we analyze how work arrangements that couple employee autonomy and performance incentives affect workplace stress. In this study, we intend to evaluate individuals’ physiological stress responses by sampling their salivary cortisol. Furthermore, we intend to compare subjective stress appraisals with the physiological response, in order to assess whether individuals potentially misjudge the extent to which a certain situation stresses them."
