abstract: "Using a student level randomization, we compare three education based conditional cash transfers designs: a standard design, a design
where part of the monthly transfers are postponed until children have to re-enroll in school, and a design that lowers the reward for attendance but incentivizes graduation and tertiary enrollment. The two nonstandard designs significantly increase enrollment rates at both
the secondary and tertiary levels while delivering the same attendance gains as the standard design. Postponing some of the attendance
transfers to the time of re-enrollment appears particularly effective for the most at-risk children.

We show that three Colombian conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs for secondary school improve educational outcomes eight to twelve years after random assignment relative to a control group. Forcing families to save a portion of the transfers until they make enrollment decisions for the next academic year increases on-time enrollment in secondary school, reduces dropout rates, and promotes tertiary enrollment and completion in the long-term. Traditional stipends improve on-time enrollment and high school exit exam completion rates in the medium-term but do not affect tertiary outcomes in the long-term. A stipend that directly incentivizes tertiary enrollment promotes secondary school on-time enrollment and enrollment in lower quality tertiary institutions in the medium but not the long-term. "
