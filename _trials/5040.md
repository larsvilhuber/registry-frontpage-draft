abstract: "Pretrial detention can be costly both for defendants and the judicial system. Studies show that pretrial detention is correlated with adverse family and economic circumstances (Holsinger & Holsinger, 2018). Pretrial detention also strains the jail system, accounting for approximately 95% of the growth in jail population since 2000 (Zeng, 2018). However, pretrial release poses the risk that defendants fail to appear (FTA) for pretrial and subsequent hearings, which is both costly and logistically burdensome to attorneys and courts. Researchers at LEO, UC- Irvine, and Stanford, as well as King County Executive, King County Metro, and the Department of Public Defense, have launched a study to evaluate whether transit subsidies can be an effective tool in reducing the FTA rate among the indigent pre-adjudicated population. In this study, clients being represented by the Department of Public Defense will be randomly selected to receive a subsidized transit card. This intervention will explore how transit subsidies affect appearance at court obligations (including trials, and mandated day reporting), as well as secondary outcomes such as future involvement with the criminal justice system and measures of well-being."
