abstract: "This experimental study tests the role of conditional cooperation for user's donations to a large online platform. Specifically, we vary the text used in solicitation banners in two randomized A/B tests. The treatment varies the communicated number of other users who donated in the past. In a second test we attempt to shed light on the persistence of conditional cooperation when relating the number of donations to the number of users of the online platform.     "
