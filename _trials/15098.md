abstract: "We explore the impact of information dissemination regarding the percentage of the workforce in China whose job tasks are likely to be affected by the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs), with exposure rates detailed by specific job positions. Our study investigates how this information influences individuals' beliefs about job replacement and AI's effects on the labor market and personal employment. Additionally, we assess its impact on support for government tax incentives for AI industry growth, perceptions of governmental responsibilities, opinions on Universal Basic Income (UBI) and related policies, views on social insurance and employment support, the skill sets considered valuable in education, and preferences for their children's future careers.
