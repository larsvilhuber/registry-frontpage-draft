abstract: "We study gender discrimination in hiring decisions in a representative sample from the United States. Participants are incentivized to choose between two candidates, one male, one female, to write an advertizing slogan for a product. They see information about the candidates, as well a sample of past work (a slogan for another product). Past work was either performed alone or in a team. Our first study will examine how discrimination varies between individual and teamwork settings, varying team composition, gender stereotypes attached to the products, and two policies aimed at reducing discrimination. Our second study will examine discrimination in the aggregate and how it varies with exposure to shocks during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
