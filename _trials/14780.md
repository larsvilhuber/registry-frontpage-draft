abstract: "The goal of this project is to compare economic preferences (including risk aversion, loss aversion, temporal discounting, coordination, cooperation, deception and altruism) of young vs. elderly adults using standard experimental economics elicitations and games. In addition, we will examine the effect of suggestions from a "rational economic agent" who always chooses an option with the highest expected value."
