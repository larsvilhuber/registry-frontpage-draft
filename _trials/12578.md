abstract: "High quality performance feedback can increase effort and help individuals identify areas for personal improvement; however, if not designed and delivered appropriately it can instead demotivate and discourage. In this study we experimentally vary the quality of feedback provided to students on their term-time performance in a large first year undergraduate module. We will vary the framing of negative performance feedback with a generic or specific positive message. We hypothesize that feedback framed with positive messaging will be better received and will lead to greater effort provision than feedback without such framing. This is hypothesized to be even stronger when the positive framing is personalized. Using detailed administrative data on date, duration and nature of student interactions with online module platforms, as well as grades on the final exam, we will evaluate the impact of different feedback qualities on effort and performance."
