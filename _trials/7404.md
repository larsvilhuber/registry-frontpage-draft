abstract: "We will implement a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of the NPower Tech Fundamentals program. NPower Inc. works with young adults and veterans and their spouses to create career pathways into the information technology industry through training and job placement. The population served by NPower is economically disadvantaged and composed of racial and ethnic groups that are underrepresented in technology careers."
