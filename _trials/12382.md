abstract: "In this project, we conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in schools in the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland, to examine whether emphasizing employers’ demand for women in math-intensive occupations affects students’ occupational aspirations and their willingness to help or sabotage other students of their own and opposite gender in incentivized games. Especially, we want to investigate whether emphasizing employers’ demand for women positively affects girls’ likelihood of choosing more math-intensive apprenticeships and whether there is any backlash among boys.
