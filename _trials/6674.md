abstract: "We investiage how the outcome of the US-presidential election on 3 November 2020 influences experts' economic expectations. We ask more than 1600 economic experts of more than 120 countries about their expectations regarding gdp growth, unemployment, inflation, and trade in their country. We randomly split the sample in two balanced subsamples. Half of the participants are surveyed five days before the election (group 1), half of the participants are surveyed five days after the election (group 2). This setup follows randomized control trial (RCT) standards. Our survey is software-based and participants fill out the questionaire online.
Our study relates to studies on political and economic uncertainty and expectations of economic experts. We expect that uncertainty gives rise to a negative economic outlook. This implies that group 1 has more pessimistic / less optimistic economic expectations than group 2. However, if Trump should win the US-presidential election we expect that economic expectations decline. While a presidential win for Trump would resolve the election uncertainty it would simultaneously create uncertainties about American (economic) policies in the next 4 years.
