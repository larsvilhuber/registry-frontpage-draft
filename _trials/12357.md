abstract: "We use a framed field experiment to study the quality of trading decisions undertaken by small individual investors of the type who trade on free platforms such as Robinhood. Our design allows us to assess the extent to which investorsâ€™ choices further their own objectives, in that we compare the choices they make to those they would have made if they properly understood the implications of their actions for the distribution of their payoffs.
