abstract: "This study investigates how parents' saving decisions for their children's college education are influenced by their beliefs and the policy environment. Using an experimental survey, we examine the impact of correcting parents' (mis)beliefs about the future costs of college and student loans interest rate. We will use the experimental data to identify a structural model that enables counterfactual policy experiments. Ultimately, the goal of the project is to provide novel evidence on how parental beliefs and public policies shape financial decisions for higher education."
