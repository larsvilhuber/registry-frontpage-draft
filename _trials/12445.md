abstract: "We experimentally vary the organizational structure of schools, and we assess the effect on resource allocation within schools and school efficiency. We do this by measuring head teacher and classroom teacher time allocation and student test scores, before and after the organizational change. We consider two organizational changes. First, in all treated schools we initiate a community volunteersâ€™ program that supplements classroom instruction and enrolls out-of-school students. Second, in a subset of treated schools we also provide a highly trained and educated teaching fellow who assists in school-wide management generally. Schools are randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups or to a control group receiving no intervention."
