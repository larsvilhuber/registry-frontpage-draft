abstract: "A recent study by Loewenfeld and Zheng (2023) documented that individuals are correlation-sensitive and exhibit behavior patterns compatible with decreasing sensitivity to payoff differences (DSPD). These behavioral regularities can be explained by two competing theories: correlation-sensitive preferences, as characterized by Lanzani (2022), with concavity, or probability dominance, as advocated by Diecidue et al. (2020). In this study, we conduct a controlled lab experiment with students to examine the mechanisms underlying correlation sensitivity in decision making. "
