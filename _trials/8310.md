abstract: "We sent 2021 fictitious applications to firms advertising job openings. In some applications we reveal that the applicant is disabled (wheel chair user) and in others we do not. In half the applications where a disability is revealed, it is revealed through a mention in the cover letter, in the other half, it is revealed through a link toward a video resume where we see the applicant sitting on a wheel chair. Among the applications where there is no disability, half of them include a link toward a video resume where the applicant sits on a regular chair and says the same speach as in the video resume with no disabilities. We compare callback rates between the different applications."
