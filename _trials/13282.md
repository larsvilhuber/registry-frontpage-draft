abstract: "Many of the world's poor live in rural areas in low-income countries that have limited access to paved roads and transportation. Previous evidence suggests that providing bicycles to school girls reduced the gender gap in access to education in India and Zambia but limited research has been conducted on the effect of providing transportation access to adults in these same settings. To address this evidence gap, we are conducting a randomized controlled trial of World Bicycle Relief's Mobilized Communities program in Mumbwa District, Zambia. 120 livelihoods groups and 273 community service workers were randomly assigned to receive a bicycle in June 2023 or to a control group. We collected baseline data immediately prior to bicycle distribution, and will return for endline data collection in May 2024. We will assess the impact of bicycle ownership on mobility and economic outcomes, including household consumption, asset value, income, and empowerment measures."
