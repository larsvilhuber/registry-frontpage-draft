abstract: "We explore the effect of two distinct frames on preferences for mixtures. Given the pervasive evidence of a preference for mixtures---non-degenerate distributions over two lotteries---we study the effect of two different frames on this behavior. The distinctive feature of these frames is whether outcomes are presented as losses or gains, while final wealth outcomes remain the same under both treatments. We expect an increase in loss-loving behavior, which would be consistent with the prior findings."
