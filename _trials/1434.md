abstract: "The primary purpose of this program is to increase the coverage of full immunization rates among children under 12 months of age in seven poor-performing districts of the state of Haryana, India. This will be done by providing non-cash incentives to parents to motivate them to consistently immunize their children. Previous research conducted in Rajasthan, India shows that lack of demand for immunization may be a key reason for low rates of full immunization, even when supply-side bottlenecks have been removed. Thus, this study will rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of providing incentives to beneficiaries in increasing full first-year routine immunization rates in Haryana. It will also look at the scalability of this approach in improving immunization coverage under the current government framework. Along with the immunization incentives experiment, the study conducts two additional experiments to evaluate various communication strategies the government could use to boost immunization rates. The first of these analyzes the potential role of village social networks: community members are asked to nominate individuals from their village who they consider good at spreading information, trustworthy in the village, or a combination of the two. These nominated 'seeds' will be expected to spread the information that they receive about immunization to other members in their community. This experiment evaluates different approaches that policymakers could use to mobilize well-suited community members to increase immunization rates. The second one, targeted reminders experiment, will provide reminders via text messages to primary caregivers, customized to the vaccination schedule of their children. This experiment is designed to evaluate a low-cost and scalable targeted immunization information system. Both of these experiments will be cross-randomized with the larger incentive experiment, which will shed more light on the efficacy of the interactions of these experiments with the incentive program.
