abstract: "Early Childhood is a crucial phase in the development of a child. Approximately 200 million children under the age of five years in developing nations have development deficits (Engle et al. 2007).  Doepke et al. (2019) argues that these development deficits may pass on to the next generation, creating a vicious poverty trap. These early deficits may take the form of stunting or malnutrition, as well as the form of lags in cognitive and non-cognitive behaviors. Since early interaction with parents and teachers are important determinants of cognitive and socio-emotional aspects of children (Shonkoff et al. 2000), it is important  that we study the knowledge and skill levels of parent and teachers in the developing economies to improve the nature of interaction between children and their surroundings.

This study is motivated by the idea that yawning gaps remain in the information levels of Early Childhood Development (henceforth, ECD) teachers, and parents, in the developing countries, on the importance of early childhood, especially in the marginalized communities. We intervene at two levels. First, we train the teacher in the ECD classroom on the best practices of early childhood in the treatment arm. Second, we provide an information nudge on these best practices to the primary caregivers of our sample students in the treatment group.  By primary caregiver, we mean the parent or guardian who spends the most time with the child in our sample. As part of our intervention, we successfully conduct twenty sessions for caregivers of kids in our sample over a period of six months. These sessions are led by the trained professionals (either teachers or facilitators) covering a range of topics in early childhood development including stimulation, hygiene, nutrition, disability, etc., and were designed by Seto Gurans, a pioneer non-governmental organization working in early childhood development in Nepal. We also vary the treatment by supplementing the trained teacher with contract licensing of trained helpers, in-classroom and out-classroom.

Our study is based in fifteen municipalities in Jhapa district of Nepal. We carried out randomization at the school level, and mapped teachers from these schools to their respective ECD sectionsâ€™ kids. These kids form the sample points for our study. We have a total of 201 schools in this study with 150 belonging to the treatment, and 51 to the control.
