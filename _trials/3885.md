abstract: "A large body of literature in economics has demonstrated that prejudice or bias of the majority group towards members of an out-group identity – whether it be racial, religious, ethnic or gender in origin – is widespread in labor markets. Such biases often lead to discrimination. It is commonly believed that labor market discrimination is one-sided: driven by employers toward their out-group employees. In this research, we restrict attention to racial identity and seek to study possible discrimination in the reverse direction, i.e., we ask, do workers discriminate on the intensive margin (say, by shirking or under-providing effort) for an out-group employer relative to an otherwise-identical, own-group one? We design a large scale real effort experiment on Amazon's Mechanical Turk to answer our research question."
