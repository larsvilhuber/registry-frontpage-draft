abstract: "Dockless bike-sharing is popular and provides the commuting service for "the last mile of trip". Users often park improperly which causes negative externalities to other users, the public space, and the circulation of shared bicycles. Users often continue to park bicycles even at parking locations that are already very crowded. Company employees need to spend efforts to transfer these bicycles to less crowded areas in order to balance local supply and demand. It is more difficult for other users to find bicycles. In this field experiment, we use machine learning to predict the destination of users' trips. Users who are predicted to ride to very busy areas will via the ride-sharing app be exposed to information treatments encouraging them to avoid parking in these areas. "
