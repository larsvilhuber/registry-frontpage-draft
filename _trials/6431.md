abstract: "We experimentally evaluate the effect of interventions offering encouragement and technological support in easing the transition to digital learning and helping to ensure that children continue to learn. Specifically, we provide free access to a student learning platform with curated digital learning content to ~1400 low cost private schools, and evaluate the extent to which an encouragement call to school-owners and offers of technology support to teachers, students, and households alleviate the barriers to adoption and utilization of digital learning. The study will evaluate the effect of these interventions on school, student, and teacher take-up and use of digital learning tools, as well as student learning outcomes and the ability of private schools to continue to operate."
