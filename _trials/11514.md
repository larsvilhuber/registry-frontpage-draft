abstract: "Numerous investigations have probed into empathy's role in understanding others' gains and losses within dyadic settings. Yet, the impact of empathy on paternalistic decision-making, particularly under conditions of uncertainty, has not been extensively explored. This study proposes to fill this gap by examining the influence of affective empathy on paternalistic decision-making using a reimagined version of the renowned "Asian Disease" problem. Vásquez and Weretka (2020) have previously illustrated that affective empathy, within non-paternalistic contexts, exhibits interdependent utility characteristics usually found in sympathetic relationships rather than antipathetic ones. We hypothesis that similar mechanisms may function within a paternalistic environment as well. Our research design incorporates a 2 (framing: gain versus loss - between) X 3 (relationship pattern: neutral, sympathetic, antipathetic - within) mixed design. Our primary analysis will be conducted using mixed-effect logistic regression. To evaluate how affective empathy influences variability within individuals, we employ Hierarchical Bayesian Estimation.  "
