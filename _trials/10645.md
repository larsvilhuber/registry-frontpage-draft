abstract: "The Indonesian government usually sends a reminder message via email to individual taxpayers to submit their tax returns on time. Still individual taxpayers often fail to submit their tax return or submit late. The country works with a self-assessment system. And tax authorityâ€™s standard message relies on a traditional, normative approach (reminding taxpayers about the reporting deadline). This study tests alternative messaging and delivering messages via WhatsApp in a field experiment in 5 Cities (Jakarta, Ciamis, Cilacap, Jayapura and Merauke) in Indonesia. The primary outcome is the timely submission of the annual tax return. Individuals are randomized into four groups:(1) Standard message, (2) WhatsApp  - Standard message, (3) WhatsApp - Deterrence message, and (4) WhatsApp - Reciprocity message."
