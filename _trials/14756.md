abstract: "We investigate the role of political identity and decision bias through an online experiment involving a representative US sample (Nâ‰ˆ1200), deployed days before the 2024 US presidential election. Participants are asked to choose between event-contingent lotteries and sure amounts, where the events involve the US election outcome, unemployment rate change, and public health care system ranking change. Our analysis explores (i) how decision-making varies between single and joint events to identify conjunction bias, (ii) how partisan identities influences this bias."
