abstract: "We analyse the effects of a Dutch early-childhood intervention that is designed to prevent child maltreatment. The intervention, Supportive Parenting, consists of six house visits when children are between 6 weeks and 18 months old. In 2002, an RCT was conducted in the Netherlands. By combining questionnaire data from the RCT with administrative data from Statistics Netherlands, we look at the short- and long-term effects of the intervention on the parents and children in the RCT. Hereby, we want to establish whether the intervention is effective in improving children's human capital, through changed parental behaviour."
