abstract: "This study investigates the causal impact of a repeated training intervention on the longer-term adoption of organic farming practices among Indonesian smallholder farmers. The intervention provides information and two rounds of training on organic farming practices. The intervention is implemented as a randomised controlled trial (RCT). This study relies on a four-wave panel data set (baseline, two midline and endline survey) and substantial qualitative field research. 
Whereas a first study has focused on the short-term effects with respect to knowledge, perceptions, awareness and experimentation (Grimm and Luck, 2023), this study will take a longer horizon and focus on the adoption of organic farming practices and the conversion from conventional to organic farming. The research design enables us to estimate the causal effect of repeated organic farming training on the adoption of organic farming practices. Given the local context of frequent over-application of chemical fertilizers, we are particularly interested to investigate whether the training exposure leads to a substitution of chemical fertilizers with organic fertilizers. The research design also permits the exploration of farmersâ€™ adoption behavior across multiple years and in response to repeated training exposure.
