abstract: "Low adoption of agricultural technologies holds large productivity consequences for developing countries. Social networks are recognized as the most credible source of information about new technologies. We investigate whether social learning can be actively leveraged to increase technology diffusion. We conduct a large-scale field experiment in which we communicate with farmers about a productive new technology through different members of social networks. We also test if communicator effort and success are susceptible to small performance incentives and flat rewards. "
