abstract: "In many large cities in developing countries, women are under-represented in public spaces and public transit. This is both caused by and reinforces the risk of experiencing various forms of sexual harassment. We study a policy to make bus travel free for women in Delhi. We compare the policy's effects on women's mobility to free bus travel induced experimentally at the individual level before the policy rollout."
