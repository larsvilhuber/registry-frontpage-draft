abstract: "Many Start Ups and Small & Medium Enterprises (SME)  an immature methodological approach to innovation and half of them present a clear deficit in innovation know-how, pointing towards a need for extra support.

 The efficacy of two approaches to building knowledge and increasing awareness of non-technical innovation among Start Ups and Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) will be tested. 

Background: 
A wide range of barriers inhibits SMEs from optimizing external advice and information in adopting proven technologies and better business practices, however there is evidence that SMEs are more likely to develop new and innovative products and services due to their agility and lean decision-making processes, thus SMEs are a suitable candidates.  

 Numerous support schemes on national and European level have been implemented to facilitate innovation activities in SMEs, yet there is very limited evidence on whether public support has positive benefits and what forms of support are most effective. The RCT will thus provide insights into the potential our form of support (intervention) will have in fostering successful implementation of innovation methodologies in non-technical innovation projects of SMEs.

Experiment: 
The sample for the RCT are firms who are either considering starting innovation activities or already in the preparation phase of innovation
projects, specifically for Impact Innovation. Two interventions will be tested. The first intervention is an expert led and peer-learning workshop in which experts from Impact Innovation provide input on essential aspects of the innovation process and experienced peers (previously funded Impact Innovation projects) share examples of how this might look in a project. The second intervention is a short guide highlighting important aspects of the innovation process and information on additional support resources, reflecting the content taught in the workshop. In addition, these firms will receive a voucher to an online expert platform, where they can link up with experts in a topic of their choice to assist them in development and implementation of a non-technical innovation project. 
The primary outcomes of the RCT are Knowledge of Innovation Process, Perceived Ability, and Attitude towards Innovation, specifically whether there has been changes since the intervention. As a secondary outcome, we are interested in Innovation Activities, specifically whether there has been an increase in innovation activities since the intervention."
