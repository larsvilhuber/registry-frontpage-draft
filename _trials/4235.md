abstract: "Mentoring is increasingly encouraged in workplaces, and a number of firms have implemented formal programs. While a growing body of research suggests that mentoring relationships benefit those being mentored (protégés), there is scant evidence to delineate whether these favorable outcomes are driven by the mentoring experience on average, by the self-selection of protégés into mentoring who anticipate having the largest gains (selection based on gains), or by the self-selection of protégés who would have performed well in the absence of mentoring (selection based on levels). We use a field experiment to evaluate a workplace mentoring program inside a large sales organization.  

Experienced employees opt-in as mentors, and new hires are slated as potential protégés. The project objective is to study the  mentoring consequences across protégés who actively elect to be formally mentored relative to those who are randomly allocated a mentor. We estimate treatment effects on sales productivity and turnover for those who select into mentoring and for those who opt out.
