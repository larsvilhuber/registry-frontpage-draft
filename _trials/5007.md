abstract: "The project aims to explore ways to encourage businesses to obtain formal registration and to test behavioral insights in the context of business registration. The project tackles informality, which is a common problem in economies of developing countries. We will make use of behavioral insights to design interventions that will be evaluated by a randomized controlled field trial. The research will generate evidence on the effectiveness of a new business registration system by providing information to businesses about the availability of the system, by pointing out that the system is free of charge, by addressing patriotic and altruistic motivations, and by highlighting that the new system is easy to use. Studying the effectiveness of interventions that aim to ‘nudge’ businesses to register will improve our understanding of how registration rates can be increased."
