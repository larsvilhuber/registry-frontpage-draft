abstract: "This study examines policymakers' and the general public's demand for evidence-based policies. Leveraging the results of a large-scale field experiment, we implement a set of survey experiments on a sample of U.S. state policymakers and a representative sample of Americans to investigate whether support for robust policy evaluation and scaling is influenced by prior beliefs on efficacy of the policy, and how respondents update their beliefs and preferences when presented with novel experimental evidence."
