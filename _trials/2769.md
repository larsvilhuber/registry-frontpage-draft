abstract: "Many small firms lack the finance and marketing skills needed for firm growth. The standard approach in many government programs has been to attempt to train the owner to develop these skills, through business training sessions or personalized consulting services. However, an alternative is to link firms to these skills in the market through insourcing workers with these skills, or outsourcing these tasks to professionals specializing in these services. We test which approach works best to grow small firms through a randomized experiment. Firms with 2-15 workers each will be randomized into five groups: a control group, a group given business training for the owner, a group given consulting services, a group linked to HR specialists who will find a worker to insource these skills, and a group linked to companies with professionals specializing in business services to outsource these skills. Impacts on business practices, firm sales and employment growth will then be measured to determine the most effective way of building skills in SMEs."
