abstract: "Active labor market policies are widely implemented to improve labor market outcomes of unemployed individuals. However, empirical evidence suggests the need for innovative policies that do not only focus on greater immediate rates of job acceptances, but also aim to improve intermediate outcomes that can lead to long-term regular employment and greater social inclusion. The proposed experimental study will evaluate the introduction of a profiling system and a new approach in the implementation of active labor market policies by the city council of Barcelona.  The new approach will assign caseworkers to assess the heterogeneous needs and interests of each individual and then implement personalized itineraries of training and social activities designed to improve their labor market and social inclusion outcomes. The new approach will be offered to a randomly selected group of socioeconomically vulnerable individuals.  "
