abstract: "ABSTRACT
Introduction 
The work of labour is an intensive exercise requiring hydration for the maintenance of tissue perfusion, calories distribution and improvement of placental circulation which ultimately affects the events of labour and fetal outcome. 1, 2  WHO recommends unrestricted oral fluid intake in labour. 3 Restrictions to oral intake in the past was for concerns of aspiration pneumonitis should recourse to Caesarean section is undertaken, while concerns for medicalization of labour makes Clinicians restrict intravenous fluid administration routinely in labour except for an indication. 4, 5  Studies have utilized clinical parameters like duration of labour, Augmentation, mode of delivery and neonatal APGAR score to estimate and determine the effect of hydration on labour and fetal outcome. 6,7, This study used the aforementioned and in addition, neonatal pulse oximetry, cord blood pH and Lactate to objectively determine the effect of hydration in labour and fetal outcome. 
Aim
To determine the effects of increased hydration on labour and fetal outcomes amongst parturients in Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital, Zaria, Nigeria
Methodology 
 A prospective interventional study (Randomized Control Trial) involving consenting Primiparous and Multiparous women randomized into 3 groups. Group 1 was allowed unrestricted oral fluid intake, Groups 2 and 3 had unrestricted oral fluid intake and additional 120 ml/hour and 240 ml/hour of intravenous ringerâ€™s lactate respectively from active phase of labour at 5 cm cervical dilatation. The duration of the stages of labour, need for augmentation, mode of delivery and maternal hemoglobin concentration; before and after delivery. Neonatal APGAR score and pulse oximetry at 1st, 5th and 10th minutes were determined. Fetal cord blood samples were taken for pH and lactate following blood gas analysis. Data was collected on an adapted proforma and partograph. Analysis was done with Statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 25.0. Test statistics, regression, coefficient of correlation, ANOVA and multiple comparison statistics were utilized in determining relationships at 95% confidence interval.
Results
The duration of the stages of labour were observed to be shortened in the increased hydration groups (2/3) with mean duration of 6 hours and SD of 1.3, while the hydration on-demand group (1) had higher mean duration of 8 hour and SD of 1.82 for the first stage of labour. The third stage of labour was noticed to be a mean duration of 8 minutes with SD 3.5 for groups (2/3) while group (1) had a mean duration of 11 minutes with SD 9.75. Caesarean section rate was 5(13.9%) in group 1 but was observed to be lower in groups (2 and 3); 3(8.3%) and 1(2.8%) respectively. Also, special baby care unit admission was observed to be 11(30.6%) for group 1 while a lower rate was observed for groups 2; 4(11.1%) and group 3; 2(5.6%) respectively. Cord blood pH was observed to be lower 7.20 in group 1 than group (2 and 3) with 7.28 and 7.27 respectively. Statistically significant relationship was observed at 95% confidence interval between increased hydration and decreased duration of second stage of labour, decreased augmentation of labour rate, decreased cord blood lactate concentration and improved 1st and 5th APGAR scores.
Conclusion
There is significant difference in the effects of increased hydration on the events of labour and fetal outcome. Duration of the stages of labour, augmentation rate, caesarean section rate, cord blood acidosis, asphyxia rate and Special baby care unit admission were all decreased by increased intravenous hydration in labour. Therefore, judiciously increased intravenous hydration in labour is superior to oral hydration in labour.
