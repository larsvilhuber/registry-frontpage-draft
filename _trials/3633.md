abstract: "Recent debate has identified important gaps in the understanding of intertemporal
risks. Critical to closing these gaps is evidence on which dimension of intertemporal risk
–the risk or the time–is evaluated first. Though under discounted expected utility this
ordering is of no consequence, under discounted non-expected utility models the order
of evaluation is critical. We provide experimental tests in which different orderings of
evaluation generate different predictions for behavior. We find more support for the
notion that the risk dimension is evaluated first."
