abstract: "This study aims to assess the impact of integrated e-extension services in reducing the vulnerability of Sri Lankan farmers to multiple shocks caused by climate change and natural hazards. The intervention involves the development of a comprehensive platform called the Smart Extension and Efficient Decision-making Hub (S.E.E.D.), which provides tailored agricultural and weather information to paddy farmers. The S.E.E.D. hub, a collaboration between FAO, the Ministry of Agriculture, and Sri Lankan research institutes, gathers, consolidates, and distributes information and advice to farmers, and it is freely accessible to farmers. The theory of change envisions the optimization of agricultural and risk management strategies (including greater production and sales diversification), which is expected to reduce farmers' vulnerability and, eventually, improve their food security. The S.E.E.D. hub will be piloted in a nationally representative sample of 220 farmer organizations (FOs) randomly assigned to the treatment and control groups. In particular, during the intervention, 110 FOs will receive early access to the hub, of which 55 FOs will also receive hands-on training on the usage of the platform. The remaining 110 FOs will serve as the control group until March 2024, after which the Government of Sri Lanka may consider scaling up the intervention.

The impact of the S.E.E.D. platform will be assessed against different dimensions related to the farmers' vulnerability in the face of multiple challenges. The evaluation will consider farmers' access to information and advices  as well as their vulnerability (measured as harvest losses), as primary outcomes,. Other secondary outcomes include paddy farmers' productivity (rice yield), farming management decisions (e.g., use of fertilizer, crop and sales diversification), and household food security (e.g., diet diversity and food consumption).
