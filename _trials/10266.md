abstract: "We investigate the potential for reducing carbon emissions in the 
transport sector due to e-biking based on a large sample of e-bikers in 
Switzerland and using a combination of GPS tracking and surveys. The 
first part of the project assesses the current situation and improves on 
the present state of knowledge about mode shift due to e-biking and the 
transport choices of e-bikers. The second part consists in a randomized 
controlled trial, in which mobility pricing based on the external costs of 
transport is implemented for a subset of the participants. We measure 
the resulting causal effects on carbon emissions and the other external 
costs of transport (health, congestion) and investigate mode substitution, 
with a special focus on e-biking. Last, the potential for carbon reductions 
due to e-biking in the population as a whole is computed, including un-
der different scenarios, i.e., future mobility pricing and transport policies. "
