abstract: "We examine whether there is return to the ability of analyzing data in the labor market in China for undergraduate students majoring in economics. We are conducting a large-scale audit study and submitted resumes of fictitious candidates to job advertisements positions posted on a popular job search platform. To manipulate perceived data analysis ability, resumes are randomly assigned different levels of data analysis skills.
