abstract: "This project measures bias in social preferences against different age groups using a money allocation task. The focus is on bias against young adults, which we refer to as “youngism”. We test whether such unfavorable treatment is partly due to an inaccurate belief that young adults face relatively little hardship. We randomly provide accurate information on the prevalence of depression and anxiety among different age groups to half of the sample (HARDSHIP treatment). We test whether such information affects social behavior towards the different age groups. "
