abstract: "We study the effects of providing rental assistance to households in Memphis, Tennessee. We randomize offers of back- and future-rent to landlords. We also randomize the fraction of future rents owed by landlords and tenants. We plan to study the effects on take-up and evictions, and, if data are available, we hope to study effects on financial outcomes, labor market outcomes, social services take-up, and health, among other outcomes.
