abstract: "Regulators are increasingly getting concerned with the power of large online platforms to bias consumer recommendations. In light of these concerns, I study the option of giving consumers control over the recommender algorithm as a potential avenue for regulation. In an online experiment, I let subjects make choices from lists, akin to an e-commerce shopping experience. The list is generated either by an algorithm that is optimizing consumer utility, or by an algorithm that includes both consumer utility and platform profit as part of its objective. My aim is to understand how subjects make choices in this abstract setting, whether recommender algorithms influence their choices, and how subjects choose between recommender algorithms. "
