abstract: "Together with the Chicago Public Schools (CPS), we are testing an intervention designed to reduce school truancy and dropout. Specifically, we are fielding a large-scale experiment to test one of the few interventions deemed by the U.S. Department of Education’s What Works Clearinghouse to have promising effects on student attendance and persistence in school – the Check & Connect (C&C) monitoring and mentoring program, which is designed to strengthen youth connections to school. Check & Connect mentors are full-time, in-school staff who regularly meet with frequently-absent students to monitor school engagement and progress, provide support services, and establish positive relationships with students and their families.The program was implemented in one third of eligible CPS elementary schools among two cohorts of students during the 2011-2012, 2012-2013, 2013-2014, and 2014-2015 school years. The remaining eligible schools served as comparison schools. Within Check & Connect schools, two grades between grades 1-8 were randomly selected to serve as control grades. Within the remaining grades, a randomly selected group of frequently-absent students received Check & Connect services. This design allows us to determine the student-level, school-level, and spillover effects of the intervention. We are studying the impacts of this intervention on academic, engagement, and attendance outcomes, as well as on long-term educational and labor outcomes. This document outlines the analysis plan for students among the second cohort (2013-2014, 2014-2015)."
