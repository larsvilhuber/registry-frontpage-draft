abstract: "A large share of the workforce works in self-employed in developing countries, a hard to tax segment, compared to salaried employees. We study the perception of fairness of the tax system, focusing on the horizontal inequity between salaried and self-employed individuals, in five large low and middle-income countries. We conjecture that the prevalence of self-employment, strengthens horizontal equity concerns, which in turn lowers demand for tax interventions, and especially direct income taxation. To test this hypothesis, we conduct online surveys eliciting individual perception on horizontal equity, tax fairness, relation to vertical equity and how these preferences relate to the tax instruments used by their governments. To test whether increased awareness of horizontal inequity affects tax preferences, we conduct a within-survey information treatments aimed at increasing the salience of this issue."
