abstract: "The pandemic highlighted the instability of the child care market and put additional financial burdens on child care providers. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP) allocated approximately $24 billion for child care stabilization grants that Health and Human Services (HHS) Administration for Children and Families (ACF), working with states, territories, and tribes, provides as subgrants to child care providers. Minnesotaâ€™s Department of Human Services (DHS) is administering several grant programs to help stabilize the child care industry in Minnesota, including the Child Care Stabilization Base Grant (CCSBG), which is available to all eligible child care providers for monthly grant awards. As part of a portfolio to learn what works to support equitable delivery of ARP, the Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES) at the U.S. General Services Administration collaborated with DHS on a randomized evaluation that seeks to understand the extent to which additional outreach strategies and modalities are effective at increasing take-up of stabilization grants among child care providers.
