abstract: "Aim and objective: To determine the effects of topical black pepper essential oil application on peripheral intravenous catheter insertion success.
Background: The vein degree is directly related to successful catheter insertion. There are many techniques to increase vein degree. However, there is only one research examining the effect of black pepper essential oil on vein degree and success of peripheral catheter insertion success.
Design: A Randomized controlled study design was used.
Methods: The CONSORT guidelines have been  used  to  describe  the  methods. 60 patients who are applying the endoscopy unit were randomly assigned to either the experimental group (30) and the control group (30). In the experimental group, black pepper essential oil was used to increase vein degree, and in the control group, no extra interventions were applied. The duration spent on determining an appropriate vein, and the duration of successful catheter insertion were recorded. 
Results: Significant improvements in vein visibility and palpability were detected after the oil application within the experimental group (p1<0.001). The period of appropriate vein selection and the period of successfully catheter insertion decreased statistically meaningful (p<0.05). 
Conclusion: Topical black pepper oil application can increase the vein degree and the success of the procedure.
Relevance to clinical practice: Black pepper essential oil, easy to use, and low cost can be used before catheter placement to increase the degree of the vein. "
