abstract: "Online gambling typically necessitates the use of personal bank accounts for both depositing and withdrawing funds. Although deposits can be executed promptly, withdrawals often entail a processing delay, typically spanning several hours to days. This asymmetry in mechanisms, favouring instant deposits while imposing a waiting period for withdrawals, appears to create additional barriers for individuals attempting to overcome gambling problems. This paper aims to investigate the impact of withdrawal barriers on gambling behaviour"
