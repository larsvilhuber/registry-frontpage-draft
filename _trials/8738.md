abstract: "Homelessness is a pervasive, demoralizing challenge faced by hundreds of thousands of Americans at any given time. It is also a difficult problem for governments to address given the numerous factors causing housing insecurity and the high costs associated with sheltering individuals for prolonged periods of time. Housing Problem Solving (HPS) aims to reduce clients' likelihood of entering a shelter in a cost-effective manner. HPS is a person-centered, housing-focused conversation that explores creative, flexible, safe, and cost-effective solutions to an individual’s housing crisis. This light-touch approach is designed to preempt homelessness or respond rapidly to it by determining individually appropriate responses. In each case, the program will seek to identify housing alternatives to a shelter, such as temporarily living with friends or family, and will also be prepared to supply immediate cash assistance in cases where this funding may prevent individuals from losing their current housing. LEO’s study in partnership with Santa Clara County will be conducted via randomized controlled trial, offering HPS to those in the treatment group while the control group will receive the existing status quo services from SCC’s continuum of care."
