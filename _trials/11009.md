abstract: "This project is on the topic of tax leakage and policy interventions to increase VAT compliance in Zambia. We will test the impact of a probabilistic incentive (similar to a lottery ticket) on the extent to which small retailers in Lusaka request VAT invoices when making purchases from their suppliers. We will examine heterogeneous impacts by some key firm characteristics measured at baseline.

In a second experiment launched concurrently with the end of the first, we will test whether a tax morale message has an impact on the value of VAT invoices retained by firms after the removal of financial incentives. This is a study of habit formation and the possibility of transitioning from extrinsic to intrinsic motivation to assist with tax compliance."
