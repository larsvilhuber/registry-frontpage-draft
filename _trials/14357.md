abstract: "Large languge models (LLMs, like ChatGPT) have been shown to be persuasive in political messaging. Less is known about whether there are personalization gains when using LLMs for political messaging (i.e., when the LLM is asked to tailor a message to a specific demographic group). This project investigates if personalized messages are more effective than unpersonalized messages."
