abstract: "We all have many identities whether it be our gender, age/cohort, class, political affiliation, race, religion or dietary preferences. There is a large literature on the role of identity in decision-making but very little on the interaction between different identities in different contexts. We set out to explore the scope for shifts in the salience of different identities and how these can impact on behavior in competitive and cooperative environments."
