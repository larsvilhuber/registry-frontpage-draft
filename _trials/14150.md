abstract: "The City of Rochester is piloting a new guaranteed basic income program. Interested low-income residents applied to the pilot, and a subset of applicants were randomly selected to receive payments of $500 each month for a year. The program was administered in two cohorts, with the first cohort receiving monthly payments from September 2023 through August 2024, and the second cohort receiving monthly payments from December 2023 through November 2024. Recipients faced no restrictions on how they could use the cash payments. The City of Rochester (City) and the Black Community Focus Fund (BCFF) are collaborating with the Wilson Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunities (LEO) on an impact evaluation testing the effect that receiving these payments had on low-income Rochester residents."
