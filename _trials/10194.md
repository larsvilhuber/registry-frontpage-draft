abstract: "IDinsight is conducting an RCT of a school leadership development program in Western Cape, South Africa. The sample is composed of 79 primary school out of which some were randomized into receiving the program, and some remain under the status quo. At endline, we will look at the school management practices to measure how well the program changed school's functioning, conduct teacher observations to understand whether the program changed quality of teaching and administer math tests to students to measure whether effects percolate to students. Lastly, we will also explore the role of gender of recipients and whether it interacts with the ability of implement the changes."
