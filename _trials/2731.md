abstract: "The present project investigates to what extent discriminatory behaviors from schools' side towards prospective students constitute a potential driver for the social segregation observed in the education system of some Spanish region. More specifically, this project studies whether schools show less willingness to interact with families of different ethnic origins and how cultural assimilation efforts from the side of migrants might mitigate such discrimination. In order to do so, we run a correspondence experiment on the population of schools."
