abstract: "The importance of health information targeting and the role of peers is being increasingly studied in low-and middle-income countries. In traditional societies like those of rural India, women continue to have limited agency over their health and decision-making due to restrictive social norms often imposed by family members such as the mother-in-law, which makes information targeting difficult. In this proposal, we propose a field experiment in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh to explore the role of inter-generational bargaining and communication within the household to improve the access of young married women in rural India to family planning and maternal health services. Our preliminary findings suggest that young women are unsure about good reproductive health practices and rely heavily on their mothers or mothers-in-law, who in turn rely on traditional knowledge. With this in mind, we propose randomizing whether health information is given to daughters-in-law (DIL) or mothers-in-law (MIL) and daughters-in-law in a household. Further, to understand the role of the community and peers in upholding traditional practices, we propose two more treatment arms where the information is given to DILs and MILs in groups of either only DILs or a mixed group of DILs and MILs.
