abstract: "Previous research on tax compliance has shown that individualsâ€™ decision to pay taxes is shaped not only by intrinsic motivation but also by extrinsic factors like perceived fairness of the tax system, reliability of the political system, and, more specifically, the perceived level of corruption in the society. In this study, we examine whether an environment of widespread corruption makes taxpayers evade more taxes. We plan to implement treatment variations to disentangle whether the effect of corruption on tax evasion is explained by the damage to the public good that corruption generates or just by having a corrupt administration in place. We divide our study into two experiments. The first one is a Public Officials experiment used as input to create an objective prior about the level of corruption by collecting Public Officials' decisions of misappropriation. The second experiment is a tax evasion game where participants can lie about their income after learning the level of corruption in their group. "
