abstract: "The experiment was implemented in 23 elementary schools in Yunmeng County in Hubei province of China. At the beginning of the spring semester in 2017–2018 school year, students from 3rd to 5th grades in the 23 schools participated in a baseline survey. Based on the information collected in the baseline survey, we can identify the left-behind children. We randomly selected 23 primary schools (145 classes) from 46 public primary schools to participate our experiment in the second semester in 2017-2018 school year. We design two treatment arms. First, video calling intervention. The video calling was directed by class head teachers, who participated in a training meeting to learn how to implement the video calling intervention. Each week, teachers spend two 10-minute sessions using their cell phones to give a video phone call to parents of left-behind children. The teacher schedules a time at the parents’ convenience, usually at lunchtime. After the time is agreed upon by the parents, the teacher takes the child to his/her office (or a spare room if there are people around) and provides their cell phone to let the child talk to their migrant parents by video call. Second, after-school tutoring intervention. After the last class in the afternoon, treated left-behind children took a 40-minute tutoring class, instructed by teachers. Each week, students have two lessons, one for Chinese and the other for mathematics. The content of class is to review the knowledge in the past days in the week. The treated children in the same grade and school were located in a spare classroom and instructed by a recruited teacher.
