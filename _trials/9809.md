abstract: "We conduct an online experiment to test whether a simple diagnostic framework can predict when interventions are likely to succeed and when they are likely to fail to change behavior. Using a real-effort task, we induce three types of environments (contexts) in which there is a behavioral barrier to "optimal" behavior: (i) Lack of awareness, (ii) lack of intention, and (iii) failure to implement the intended choice. For each of these environments, we then test the effectiveness of three types of interventions that are commonly used to address the behavioral barriers (reminders, incentives, simplification). We thereby attempt to show that the effectiveness of each intervention depends on the underlying environment, which can be diagnosed using a simple set of survey questions."
