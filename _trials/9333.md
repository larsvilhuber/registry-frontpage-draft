abstract: "We designed a randomized field experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of feedback provision to promote recycling. We can observe individual real-time data on bio-waste recycling thanks to the introduction of a system of electronic bins in a Spanish densely populated city. We exploit these data to evaluate the impact of providing feedback on participation  in waste sorting. The recruitment of participants was implemented by a team of environmental educators who has direct interaction with citizens. 

In the control group, the subjects receive only one piece of information: A reminder about the recycling program. In the treatment group, the subjects receive two pieces of information: the reminder about the recycling program (as in the control group) and a report of past recycling performance of the household. In this way, one group receives information about its own recycling performance and the other does not."
