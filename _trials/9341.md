abstract: "We study the role of preferences and information for socially responsible investments (SRI) in an incentivized online experiment with high net worth investors and combine this data with administrative data of real portfolio holdings of the same investors. We analyze which investors buy sustainable stocks, to what extent are they willing to pay for information about the sustainability of stocks and how investors react to information about the performance of sustainable stocks. To address these questions, we experimentally elicit altruism and warm glow and combine these measures with survey evidence, administrative data of real investments and the outcomes in an incentivized stock market game. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of information about the performance of sustainable investments on information search and investment behavior in our stock market game and the real-world portfolios of the participating investors."
