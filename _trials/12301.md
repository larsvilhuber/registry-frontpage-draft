abstract: "We conduct a field experiment in a hospital to investigate the impact of information intervention for patients and families on their risky behaviors. We focus on families defined as high-risk pregnant women participating in Multi-discipline Treatment (MDT) and their companions. The families receive the information once before and four times after MDT. We manipulate 1) the content of information provided to pregnant women across treatments, including personalized disease information and emotional support, and 2) whether the additional information is provided to the companions. Additionally, we collect data on preferences and rationality scores of, and coordination level between the pregnant women and their companions before MDT. Our study also explores the role of these behavioral traits on pregnancy-related risky behavior."
