abstract: "In a previous RCT we documented gains of 0.08 SD in Math learning due to a Social and Emotional Learning intervention in an online tutoring program. We propose a follow-up RCT in the same setting with the aim to  to quantify the opportunity cost of reallocating instructional time from other subjects, such as Math, to SEL. And also to uncover the driving mechanisms behind the observed learning effects of SEL interventions. The study hypothesizes three distinct channels influencing these effects: tutor-student relationships, tutors' emotional intelligence, and students' emotional intelligence. "
