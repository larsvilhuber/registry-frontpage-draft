abstract: "This project investigates how students make decisions around the financing of their college education and the impacts these decisions have on educational outcomes. Specifically, we investigate how the framing of loan offers and provision of additional information about student loan options affects students' borrowing decisions and postsecondary outcomes. This research project will consist of a set of randomized controlled trials over the presentation of loan offers at anonmyous community colleges. The first experiment, conducted over the 2015-16 academic year, involved random assignment of nonbinding student loan offers. Students’ ability to borrow did not vary: all students will have the option to borrow up to their maximum federal loan eligibility, and only the framing of the choice (e.g. whether or not a particular loan amount is referenced) was affected. Students’ financial and academic outcomes will be tracked for five years, with information on borrowing and academic outcomes obtained from institutional administrative data and a match to the National Student Clearinghouse. The second experiment, conducted over the 2016-17 academic year, involved random assignment of emails to students who had recieved their financial aid award information (including student loan offers) but had not year made their borrowing decisions. Emails included information relevant for students' borrowing decisions: that students could borrow an amount different than that listed in their award letter, the average conditional amount borrowed per year by past graduates, and the average unconditional amount borrowed per year by past geaduates. This project will improve our understanding of college students’ financial decision making and will provide guidance to help colleges across the country package and provide information about student loans to best serve their students’ needs."
