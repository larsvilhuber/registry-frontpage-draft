abstract: "Past  research  has  found  price  discrimination  in  B2C  markets,  where  buyers  are  end  customers.  There  is limited study on suppliers’ price quoting behavior and price discrimination on B2B markets. It is unclear whether characteristics of B2B buyers, who are often representatives of firms and not the end customers,would influence suppliers’ pricing decisions. In this research, we investigate whether there exists wholesale price discrimination, by conducting randomized field experiments on Alibaba.com, the world largest online global  trade  platform.  We  find  that  there  is  no  significant  difference  in  the  wholesale  prices  quoted  by suppliers to U.S. and South Africa buyers. We also find that suppliers quote a significantly higher wholesale price to White buyers than Asian or Black buyers across countries. However, price discrimination disappears when buyers present market information to sellers—providing the lowest wholesale price offered by other suppliers  in  the  market,  whereas  price  discrimination  remains  when  buyers  present  social  information  to sellers—indicating  the  buyer  is  recommended  by  a  previous  customer.  In  addition,  we  find  that  market information  can  help  buyers  obtain  a  lower  wholesale  price  because  it  signals  a  lower  willingness  to  pay.Social information, however, can reduce price quotes for only Black and White buyers as it fosters trust, but not for Asian (particularly Chinese) buyers possibly due to the distrust between Chinese sellers and buyers."
