abstract: "Job applicantsâ€™ preference---i.e., how interested they are in the jobs they apply for---may be hard for employers to observe and for jobseekers to signal. This information asymmetry may lead to the loss of productivity by creating job mismatches. In an online job fair organized by a large Bangladeshi job portal, we experimentally introduce a preference signaling mechanism that allows jobseekers to express their interest to employers. Each jobseeker is endowed with so few signals that the mechanism may be credible. We estimate the effects on both employers and jobseekers. "
