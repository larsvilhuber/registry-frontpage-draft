abstract: "We seek to identify the effects of providing district-level average student achievement data and/or average student growth data on subjects’ hypothetical school district enrollment decisions. Compared to average achievement at a single point in time, average growth is arguably better able to capture schools’ and school systems’ contributions to student learning. Average growth also bears a weaker relationship to the racial and socio-economic composition of the student body, making it easier to identify highly effective schools that serve less advantaged students.

This study consists of an online survey experiment in which each subject is asked to imagine that s/he is a parent who is moving to a new city. When deciding where to live, one of their top priorities is to choose a school district for their elementary school-age child. The survey will provide basic demographic information about the five largest school districts in the metropolitan area. In addition to the demographic information, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either 1) average achievement data, 2) average growth data, 3) both, or 4) neither. Based on these data, subjects will choose their preferred school district.

Subjects will be asked to complete this process for the metropolitan areas of the five largest cities in the United States: New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, and Phoenix. At the end of the survey, subjects will answer a small battery of basic demographic questions."
