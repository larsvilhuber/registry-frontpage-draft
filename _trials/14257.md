abstract: "This experimental study investigates how group identity and narrative styles influence intergroup conflicts. It seeks to understand the underlying causes of group conflicts and explore methods for their resolution. By using randomly selected group identities and narrative styles, the study sends descriptions of intergroup relationships to randomly chosen individuals to assess whether these factors affect perceptions of group relations. Through the analysis of experimental data, the study aims to identify effective strategies for reducing group conflicts, thereby contributing to global peace and social harmony."
