abstract: "Consumer surveys and scanner data show a significant and persistent gap in the consumption of red meat between men and women. We investigate in this study if the gender gap in consumption may come from gender stereotypes. Sociological and psychological studies have shown a link between masculinity and meat consumption, such that the consumption of red meat signals a strong male identity. 
This study analyses if gender stereotypes have a causal effect on consumption. The object of the study has substantial importance in itself: understanding red meat consumption may provide valuable keys to decreasing it, a global aim and one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Red meat is both a source of health concerns and pollution. At the same time, reducing gender stereotypes and gender inequality is also a SDG and continues to be a central topic of research.
This online survey experiment is designed to answer two main questions on the link between red meat consumption and gender. First, do we find that the gender gap in red meat consumption is explained by stereotypical views on gender? Second, how elastic is stereotypical consumption? In other words, can gender identity primes or association awareness exercises change the gender gap in red meat consumption?
The outcome of these interventions on the preference for red meat may later be used to design a field experiment that will directly link the intervention to observed consumer behavior. It can also be extended to better understand how advertising/public intervention may affect the gender gap in consumption."
