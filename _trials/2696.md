abstract: "Malnutrition and lack of cognitive stimulation are primary risk factors of early childhood development and highly correlated with poverty. Particular children growing up in highly resource constrained environments often fail to reach their developmental potential, which adversely affects socio-economic outcomes later in life.
This trial tests at large scale a set of potentially cost-effective tools to improve cognitive, language, socioemotional and motor development of toddlers in rural Bihar, India. We evaluate three interventions with 2000 children aged between 10 and 32 months. The first intervention addresses iron deficiency anemia, a biological risk factor of early development. We distributed a small cast iron ingot shaped like a tulsi leaf, labelled the Lucky Iron Leaf, for iron fortification. By placing the Lucky Iron Leaf in a cooking vessel of boiling water it releases iron into the water and the food. The second intervention addresses cognitive stimulation, a psychosocial risk factor of early development. We conducted four home visits during which dialogic reading was trained and practiced with the primary caregiver and her child. Dialogic reading refers to a method of looking at picture books which emphasizes strategic questioning and feedback in order to encourage children to speak and learn. For daily practice of dialogic reading three picture books were given to the caregiver and her child. Adding on intervention two, the third intervention is a dialogic reading calendar and serves as a reminder and encouragement for daily dialogic reading. We distributed colourful calendars, containing the months of the year, relevant moon periods and religious holidays, and caregivers use stickers to indicate whenever they practiced dialogic reading. 
The trial follows an individually randomised controlled design. We randomly allocated caregiver-child pairs to one of six groups: (i) Lucky Iron Leaf group, (ii) dialogic reading group without a calendar, (iii) dialogic reading group with a calendar, (vi) Lucky Iron Leaf and dialogic reading group without a calendar, (v) Lucky Iron Leaf and dialogic reading group with a calendar, and (vi) no-intervention group. 
We expect the iron fortification intervention to reduce iron deficiency anemia and consequently to improve cognitive and motor development. We expect the dialogic reading intervention to show positive effects on the childâ€™s expressive and receptive vocabulary and socioemotional development. Further we expect these effects to be reinforced among the dialogic reading calendar groups."
