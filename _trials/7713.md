abstract: "One important tool in the controlling of the COVID-19 pandemic lies in fast and effective detection of individuals who have been in close contact with infected persons. In this context, contact tracing apps such as the German "Corona-Warn-App" (CWA) can play an important role. 
Installation and use of the contact tracing app represents a public good: everyone, even those who do not install an app, benefits from faster tracking of suspicious cases. Recent updates to the functionality of the CWA allow for significantly enhanced tracing effectiveness by introducing a Check-in function as well as reporting of rapid antigen test results.

In our main experiment (AEARCTR-0006529), we investigated whether and how targeted feedback on local COVID-19 incidence rates and social comparisons with other regions can increase the willingness to install the CWA. We tested this on a large-scale through targeted social media ads. One interesting finding was that the increases in click-through rates were to a significant part predicted by incrases in initial level of attention. In this control experiment, we aim to further examine the behavioral mechanisms underlying the results from our main experiment. In particular, we plan to test modifications of our original interventions to study the roles of information targeting and perceptual salience."
