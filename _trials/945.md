abstract: "Irrigation is more important than ever in ensuring sustainable livelihoods for farmers In the face of increasing climate uncertainty. Yet, in the poorest parts of the rural world, the rates of irrigation are low. In Mozambique, only 8% of all farmers have access to irrigation. One source of Mozambiqueâ€™s inability to develop widespread irrigation infrastructure has been an inability to sustain and protect previous investments in the sector.  A lack of attention to creating local institutions capable of maintaining the infrastructure has historically led to infrastructure decaying before reaching its productive potential (FAO, 2005). Forming strong institutions begins with selecting the right set of beneficiaries who can function and cooperate together to maximize productive potential of schemes.  

The evaluation aims to shed light on if different approaches to select beneficiaries can reduce elite capture and result in a more equitable distribution of benefits. However, the potential trade-offs between inclusion of smaller farmers and successful management remain an empirical question. We will exploit exogenous variations in the composition of water users groups induced by the random assignment to the two targeting regimes to shed light on the causal relation between group composition and collective action over operation and maintenance of the schemes, and final impact on production."
