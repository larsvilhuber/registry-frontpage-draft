abstract: "More than 10 years have passed since the nuclear accident caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011. Scientific evidence shows that there's low possibility of radiation-induced problems.However, radiation stigma still exists and this could cause discriminations.

In October 2022, we conducted an online experimental survey to mitigate radiation stigma in Japan (N=10,080). Our analyses suggested that accurate scientific information that tells low possibility of radiation problem, or social information that others believe there's low possibility of radiation problem can mitigate radiation stigma.

In this study, we examine discriminatory attitude toward people who are threatened by radiation stigma and discover informational interventions that can mitigate the discrimination with dictator games. We conduct nationwide online experiments with financially incentivized dictator games for this purpose. The candidates of the intervention are the scientific and social information discovered in October 2022."
