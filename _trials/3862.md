abstract: "We use agriculture social network data from over 100 communities in Honduras and identify farmers to target and train on new technology and practices to prevent and control a new pest that posits negative externalities to the community. A randomized controlled trial compares targeting approaches in their effectiveness for information diffusion within existing networks. The targeting strategies rely on: community leaders of existing institutions, theory-driven network statistics, community nominated to best transmit a message, and random farmers within the network. The comparison provides information on the cost-effectiveness and scalability of these targeting strategies"
