abstract: "This study investigates the effects of teacher empathy and reflection on students’ engagement and teachers’ career advancement. We achieve this by collaborating with an online university student tutoring firm based in China. The firm is implementing a university tutor training program that includes three interventions: an empathy intervention, a reflective teaching intervention, and a combined empathy and reflection intervention. The intervention aims to improve teaching quality and students' learning experience by enhancing the tutors’ empathy and reflection, and, in turn, attracting more students to their tutoring services.  As the firm has randomly assigned tutors into one of four groups (three treated and one control), we utilize this randomization to investigate the causal effect of the teacher empathy and reflection intervention on students’ course attendance, completion, and enrolment, as well as on tutors’ teaching performance evaluations and wages."
