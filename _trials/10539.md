abstract: "The Behavioral Interventions to Advance Self-Sufficiency-Next Generation (BIAS-NG) project, sponsored by the Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation in the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, uses principles of behavioral science to try to improve human services program design and outcomes. Behavioral science is an interdisciplinary field that incorporates psychology, economics, and other social sciences to provide insight into how people process information, make decisions, and take actions. BIAS-NG partners with state and local human services agencies to diagnose behaviorally-based barriers to program success, design interventions to address those barriers, and test the efficacy and cost efficiency of those behaviorally informed interventions relative to status quo service delivery. 

For this study, BIAS-NG worked with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Social Service (DPSS). DPSS manages the Los Angeles County Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program called California Work Opportunities and Responsibilities to Kids (CalWORKs). California’s TANF policies mandate that adult CalWORKs recipients participate in 20-35 hours per week of approved work activities, or welfare-to-work activities, as a condition of receiving benefits. If CalWORKs recipients are required to participate in welfare-to-work activities, they must also attend required meetings and report the hours they spent on these activities. 

In Los Angeles County, the welfare-to-work activities are administered through the Greater Avenues for Independence (GAIN) program which is also overseen by DPSS. All adults in Los Angeles County who receive public assistance benefits through CalWORKs are required to participate in GAIN unless they meet criteria for an exemption, although those who are “exempt” may participate voluntarily. The GAIN program offers a variety of welfare-to-work activities that aim to support participants in finding sustainable work. One of these activities is Job Club, which is the focus of this BIAS-NG study. Job Club is a four-week program designed to support participants with building skills they need to find and obtain a job, such as developing a resume and interviewing techniques. Job Club participants then apply these skills to searching for a job during the program period.

When BIAS-NG and DPSS began working together, DPSS staff identified the challenge of low participant engagement in GAIN activities and set a goal of increasing engagement. Low engagement in GAIN activities is a challenge for both staff and participants. If a GAIN participant does not comply with the program requirements, GAIN program staff place the participant in a non-compliance status, initiating a process that may lead to the participant being sanctioned and having their benefits reduced. Having a participant enter non-compliance status is a very time-consuming process for both staff and participants. When a participant is placed in non-compliance status, the GAIN Service Worker (GSW) who manages the participant’s case must attempt to contact the participant multiple times, and if the participant does not respond to attempts to schedule a meeting, the GSW will make a visit to the participant's home. The GSW and participant must have a meeting to determine whether a participant had “good cause” for not complying with requirements before sanctions are issued. This whole process often takes two months to complete.

Additionally, participants can miss out on substantial benefits if sanctioned. In 2018, for one-person households, sanctioning reduced monthly benefits by as much as $355. For two- or three-person households, which often include children whose benefits are not reduced by sanctions, benefits were reduced by as much as $222 or $137, respectively. Of GAIN participants not exempted from the work requirement, 36 percent were in sanction status as of August 2018. 

Working closely with DPSS, the research team identified key points in GAIN’s program processes (such as meetings, transitions, or activities) where participants did not meet GAIN program requirements or stopped participating in GAIN en masse. We refer to these points as “drop-off points.” The analysis of these drop-off points led the team to focus on attendance at Job Club. Of participants who were referred to Job Club in June 2017, only 38 percent started Job Club within 30 days of referral.  Activity attendance is a problem across other GAIN activities as well. 

The research team conducted interviews with GAIN staff and participants and used the information they shared to hypothesize several behavioral barriers that may be impacting Job Club attendance. These included participants not understanding GAIN program requirements, sanctions not being salient enough to achieve their purpose of motivating participants to comply with GAIN requirements, hassles associated with arranging child care and transportation, negative associations with GAIN programs, and having other life stressors that make attending Job Club a less pressing concern.

In response to these behavioral challenges, DPSS and the research team developed a text messaging intervention, further described in the Intervention section below. The goal of the texting intervention is to increase participation in Job Club, thereby reducing the incidence of sanctions due to failure to comply with GAIN requirements. In addition to initial attendance, the intervention was designed to increase the percentage of participants who complete Job Club successfully, meaning they find employment within the four weeks of Job Club and stop attending, or they complete all four weeks of Job Club. To capture these two goals, the primary outcomes will be attendance at Job Club in the first 30 days after referral, attendance at Job Club within the first 60 days after referral, and entrance into non-compliance status within 60 days of referral. The first two measures correspond with key drop-off points: 1) between the point someone is assigned to Job Club and the scheduled Job Club start date and 2) between the scheduled Job Club start date and completion. 

For the impact evaluation, clients were randomly assigned to receive the behaviorally informed text messages (program group) or not (control group). The point of random assignment was when clients were referred, or assigned, to Job Club. The evaluation will compare outcomes of the program group to the control group for the full sample and several sub-groups. In addition to the impact study, BIAS-NG is conducting accompanying implementation and cost analyses to document how the intervention was delivered and at what cost. "
