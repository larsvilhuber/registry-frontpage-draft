abstract: "The study aims at testing empirically the theoretical approach of choice-matching proposed by CvitaniÄ‡ et al. (2019, AER: Insights, 1(2), 179-192) for incentivizing truthful responding. We apply the proposed framework to the context of stated preferences. While the choice-matching approach is originally designed for incentivizing responses to a multiple choice question, we illustrate its possible application to an open-ended question. To that end, we conduct an online experiment, mirroring a standard stated preference survey as used for valuation of public goods. We implement two versions of the survey questionnaire: one employing the incentive-compatible choice-matching approach and another representing a common hypothetical setting. The two survey versions differ only with respect to necessary characteristics for implementing the choice-matching. In particular, both versions employ the same open-ended question for eliciting individual's willingness-to-pay values for a public good. The good is a policy project of installing solar panels in public spaces of the city of Warsaw in Poland (e.g., railway stations) so that these places could increase their green energy use. We inquire whether willingness-to-pay values are different when stated under the choice-matching approach than when expressed in standard conditions without any incentivization to truthful responding."
