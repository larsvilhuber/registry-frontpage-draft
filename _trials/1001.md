abstract: "This study evaluates the impact of accountability mechanisms–through different models of health inspections–on quality of care and patient safety, quantity, and prices of health services in Kenya. Using health markets as the unit of intervention (clusters of health facilities where no facility is more than 4 KM from the center of the market), we experimentally allocate all private and public health facilities in three Kenyan counties to one of three arms: (1) high-intensity inspections with enforcement of warnings and sanctions for non-compliant facilities; (2) high-intensity inspections with enforcement of warnings and sanctions for non-compliant facilities and public disclosure of inspection results, and (3) “business-as-usual” low-probability inspections (the control group). The results from this study will contribute to understanding the extent to which governance and accountability mechanisms can help improve service delivery in low-income countries, particularly in this case related to improving patient safety and quality of care in the public and private sectors, and if so, how these systems may operate when they are implemented “at scale.” Another important contribution of this project is the development of a set of tools and instruments that can be broadly deployed both in surveys of quality and in the design of inspection systems across diverse low-income settings."
