abstract: "Remote work appears to be here to stay. Yet, anecdotal evidence from organizational leaders suggests that new hires who join the organization remotely perform poorly and are less engaged. This field experiment provides evidence on whether newcomer performance and engagement are worse when starting their position in-person compared to remotely. Additionally, I test the efficacy of an organizational policy where newcomers start in-person prior to working remotely in mitigating reductions (if any) in performance and work engagement. This field experiment compares new hires who work remotely for four week and new hires who work in the office for three weeks then remotely for one week. "
