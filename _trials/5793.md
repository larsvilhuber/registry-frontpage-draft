abstract: "This study consists of three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) designed to improve our understanding of the interaction between a pandemic health crisis and political behavior in an established democracy with a strong party system. The RCTs are embedded in an online survey of a nationally representative sample of 2,000 residents of the United States. The first RCT investigates three mechanisms through which the coronavirus pandemic might be impacting support for the U.S. President and for state governors. The second RCT investigates how the President’s public responses to the pandemic (as recalled by respondents, without reminding them of any specifics) are shaping people’s behaviors that are widely believed able to influence the spread of the virus. The third RCT considers whether different specific messages made by the President can change the likelihood of these behaviors relative to a control group and a group receiving message from doctors."
