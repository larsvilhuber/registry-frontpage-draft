abstract: "Despite a decade of rapid economic growth, the access of Cambodian villagers to public services and facilities is still among the lowest in the region. Such failures in service delivery are considered by development agencies and researchers to be at least partially due to limited citizen engagement with local public institutions, which in turn reduces the responsiveness of service providers to the needs of the population. In order to enhance the accountability of service providers and local officials and, as a result, improve the quality of service delivery, the Cambodian government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and bilateral donors have – with assistance from the World Bank through the Voice and Action Program (VAP) – developed the Social Accountability Framework (SAF). Whereas evaluations of social accountability interventions in other contexts indicate that such interventions have been unsuccessful due to a failure to provide service providers and local officials with incentives to change their behavior, the design of the SAF builds on lessons from the body existing research by providing for coordinated interventions by both state and non-state actors. The Voice and Action Program (VAP) Impact Evaluation (VAP-IE) will use a randomized controlled trial conducted across 42 districts in 15 provinces of Cambodia to determine whether the coordinated interventions mandated by SAF improve the quality of educational, health, and commune services provided to villagers in rural Cambodia and increase villagers’ engagement with local government. Evidence from the VAP-IE will be used by national authorities, NGOs, bilateral donors, and the World Bank to inform future funding and design decisions related to the National Decentralization Reform. The VAP-IE is also expected to contribute to general knowledge on the efficacy of social accountability interventions by providing a rigorous assessment of whether an innovative program that coordinates interventions by state and non-state actors can be successful in enforcing accountability and improving the quality of service delivery.
