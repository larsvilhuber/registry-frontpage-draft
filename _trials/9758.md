abstract: "Despite overwhelming medical evidence on the protection offered by second, third and fourth Covid-19 vaccine doses, uptake of these doses remains low in Chaco province, Argentina, even though the vaccine is in ready supply. Several factors may account for this low uptake, including friction costs, intention-behaviour gaps, and lower perception of risk from Covid-19 compared to previous moments of the pandemic. Interactive communication via chatbot may help address these barriers and promote vaccination. In this randomized controlled trial, participants in the intervention group will receive personalized Whatsapp chatbot messages informing them that they are eligible for the next dose, sharing practical information on when and where to get vaccinated, providing planning prompts and enabling them to set reminders to get their next dose of the vaccine on a convenient date. Vaccination outcomes for participants in the intervention group will be compared with those of participants receiving a simple non-chatbot reminder message and of participants receiving no message. "
