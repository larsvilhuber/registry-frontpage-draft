abstract: "Building on a major initiative by the Indian state of Chhattisgarh, which distributed over 2 million smartphones to rural Chhattisgarhi women, we test whether a gender-targeted phone-based information service can raise womenâ€™s knowledge and general awareness of appropriate health  and  nutrition-linked  behaviors  and  increase  take-up  of  health  programs. Women enrolled in the service, known as Mor Awaaz, receive weekly phone calls with entertaining, pre-recorded information on good health and nutrition practices. Once a month, we survey women on these topics. The Mor Awaaz study randomizes the number of enrollees within villages to understand the role of peers in outcome changes, and the provision of in-kind incentives to individual enrollees to engage with monthly surveys. To understand the direct impact of health and nutrition messages on related knowledge and behaviors, we build on the Mor Awaaz platform to randomize specific information sent to phone service enrollees over a limited time period. After sending these messages to women, Mor Awaaz enrollees are surveyed through the phone service. To understand knowledge spillovers within villages, we also randomly assign specific message streams at the individual level in one of our treatment arms."
