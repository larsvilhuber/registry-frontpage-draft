abstract: "We designed a natural field experiment to test the impact of MBWA in collaboration with one of the retail divisions of a medium-sized bank located in Latin America. The division that we worked with has around 1,000 employees and 79 branches. The experiment allowed us to exogenously manipulate the schedule of field visits that the divisional manager made to the branches. To stress test the value of MBWA, we implemented our intervention at a time when incentives were strong, as the bank employees were engaged in a series of tournaments that the bank ran among its branches with the objective of stimulating sales. Throughout the six months of the tournaments, we randomly planned the visits of the retail division manager to the branches. Each branch was visited once, and only once by the division manager. "
