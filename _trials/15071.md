abstract: "Financial scams impose huge costs on consumers and the financial industry. Consumer education is viewed as one part of a wider toolkit to address fraud, particularly given the growth in authorised push payment fraud (APP), where consumers unwittingly authorise digital payments to fraudsters (BPFI, UK Finance). Through an online trial, we intend to test the causal effects of providing generic or scam specific fraud education tips, or a visual fraud warning, just before the payment confirmation step within a simulated banking app. We will disentangle which, if any, of these interventions assist consumers to detect fraudulent scenarios, and whether any of the methods are more or less effective. Additionally, we will test which methods are associated with greater consumer comprehension and overconfidence, as well as whether effectiveness varies with participants online risky payment behaviour. Our results will aid policymakers in their efforts to protect consumers from payment fraud. "
