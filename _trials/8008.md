abstract: "An individual may choose either (1) a private sector job with high-powered incentives but no opportunities for corruption, or (2) a public
sector job that provides opportunities for corruption also for engaging in directly benefitting the citizenry. The individual potentially possesses
altruism and moral norms which are reflected in their behavior in a dictator and a modified Fischbacher and FÃ¶llmi- Heusi experiment. We first
derive the theoretical predictions that link altruism, immorality-aversion, choice of occupations, and the decision to be corrupt. We then conduct
experiments to stringently test the predictions."
