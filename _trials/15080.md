abstract: "Existing evidence suggests that entrepreneurs do not frequently employ robust methods to make decisions under uncertainty. Entrepreneurs tend to rely more on intuition than structured decision-making processes to discover the value of their business ideas. However, these methods have the potential to provide high-quality information for entrepreneurs’ strategic decision-making in their business ventures. Therefore, it is important to study how applying structured methods helps entrepreneurs improve the quality of their strategic decisions and enhance their ventures’ performance. This becomes even more relevant in a context where new elements of uncertainty arise, going beyond purely commercial aspects, such as the environmental and social sustainability of ventures.

This project investigates one of these methods. Specifically, it examines the causal relationship between the so-called “scientific method” and the performance of entrepreneurs in Uruguay. By formulating theories, hypotheses, and experiments to validate business models, the scientific method potentially improves the quality of strategic decisions and, in turn, business performance. Specifically, through this RCT, we will study the impact of applying the scientific method on project abandonment, modifications (pivots) to business models, and entrepreneurs’ revenues.

To this end, two controlled experiments are designed: one replicating a previous study, and another based on the former but focused on sustainable businesses, thereby providing novel findings. Upon completion of the experiment, it will be possible to (a) evaluate whether this method leads to better performance for those who employ it in a higher-uncertainty economy compared to the original study done in Italy and the UK (b) understand how this method enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of sustainable businesses, and (c) translate the findings into concrete products aimed at fostering entrepreneurship and sustainable enterprises in Uruguay."
