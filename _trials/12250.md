abstract: "We conduct an experiment at a Chinese middle school to examine how rewarding students for previous accurate predictions or recall regarding their exam performance affects their subsequent memory and predictions. Intervention occurs at both class and individual levels. Half the classes are rewarded for their previous correct recall, while the other half are rewarded for their previous correct predictions. Within each class, students who answered correctly are randomly chosen for either cash or gift rewards. After students complete a post-intervention exam, we administer a survey to evaluate the treatment effect in recalling exam performance and predicting future exam performance."
