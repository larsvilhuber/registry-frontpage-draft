abstract: "Humanitarian organizations operate within stringent budget constraints and regularly need to prioritize and re-prioritize their assistance, depending on needs and funding. In this study, we partner with the largest humanitarian organization in the world - the World Food Programme (WFP) - to investigate alternative approaches to prioritize assistance in the context of a scaling down of humanitarian operations. The study takes place in Lebanon, where WFP is planning to scale down its food assistance program from about 58,000 beneficiary households to about 25,000, due to resource constraints. 

We will compare four different approaches to prioritize households during this downscaling: three data-driven approaches will rely on Proxy Mean Testing (PMT) to select households according to different predicted outcomes (expenditure, food security, or a combination of the two), while the fourth targeting approach will rely on criteria identified through a survey conducted among local experts. The study will investigate how the different approaches lead to different profiles of beneficiaries and how these differences impact the effectiveness of assistance. The experimental design will moreover allow us to causally assess the impact of the (dis)continuation of food assistance itself, through the definition of comparable groups of beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries across the four different approaches (more specifically, we will assess the impact on the “marginal” households, i.e. eligible under one targeting method but not another).  

We will study dynamics over time through two rounds of follow-up data collection, and we will also take advantage of the staggered fading out of assistance (in two phases), to study how households might prepare for the end of assistance and which coping mechanisms they might adopt.
