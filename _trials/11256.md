abstract: "In this pilot study, we aim to evaluate the premarital counselling program (Bimwin) conducted by sub-district religious offices (KUA) in Indonesia. Pre-marital counselling may be a powerful means of shaping, aligning, and setting expectations around the needs and desires of women in a marriage, with implications for sexual and reproductive health, fertility, intra-household bargaining power, female labor force participation, and couplesâ€™ general wellbeing. We will randomize an invitation to the two-day, face-to-face premarital counselling program. Under this scenario, the couples in the control group either receive a shortened in-person or virtual Bimwin , or no Bimwin program at all. One key outcome of this pilot study will be take-up, or the conversion rate from opportunity to attendance. We will also evaluate short-term impacts on economic, health, and psychosocial outcomes of the couples. "
