abstract: "Knowing how refugees choose their destination country helps to plan humanitarian assistance and integration policies. This Pre-Analysis Plan describes how we are going to study the relative importance of networks, social benefits, labor market opportunities, housing costs, knowledge of potential destination country language, and proximity to home in refugees’ destination country choice. We compare choices in forced-choice conjoint experiments among Ukrainian refugees in various European countries with their actual choices. Surveying Ukrainian refugees is well suited to compare stated and revealed preferences as they are given equal rights to temporary protection and labor market access in all EU countries."
