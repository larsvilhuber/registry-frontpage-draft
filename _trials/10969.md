abstract: "This project examines how decision-makers acquire and use information in their evaluation decisions. Using a controlled experiment, we explore how individuals assess candidates given noisy signals of quality and how they choose to acquire additional (costly) information about the candidateâ€™s quality before making a final decision. In particular, we ask whether candidate gender impacts evaluator decisions about whether to seek out more information before making a decision. Do evaluators require fewer positive signals to decide that a male candidate is above-the-bar compared to the number of signals they would need to make that same determination for a female candidate? How many negative signals are required before a candidate is rejected, and does this depend on candidate gender? In addition, by comparing across two randomly-assigned treatments, one in which additional information is provided exogenously and one in which decision-makers choose when to acquire more information, we ask whether the endogeneity of information acquisition amplifies discriminatory outcomes."
