abstract: "This study aims to identify the presence of (taste-based) discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals, and whether it can be reduced by norm signalling. The experiment will involve a dictator game with third-party punishment. The primary focus will be on the behaviour of the dictators. LGBTQ+ discrimination will be measured by comparing donations to receivers wearing a rainbow shirt and those wearing a 'normal' shirt. The effectiveness of norm signalling will be measured by comparing donations when the third party has chosen an avatar with a rainbow flag t-shirt versus a regular t-shirt."
