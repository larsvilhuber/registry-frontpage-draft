abstract: "School food programmes are a popular way to support the education, health and nutrition of school children. The Ghana School Feeding Programme (GSFP) reaches over 1.6 million primary school children across all regions of Ghana. Private caterers are awarded contracts by the GSFP to procure, prepare and serve food to pupils. The caterers are able to procure on a competitive basis without commitment to purchasing from small-scale farmers. 

‘Home-grown’ school feeding aims to link the increased demand for school feeding goods and services to community stakeholders, including small-holder farmers (mainly subsistence farmers) and women groups. This study proposes a randomized control trial that aims to evaluate the impact of school feeding sourced from small-holder farmers on small-holder food security, and the overall effects of the GSFP on child nutrition and education in Ghana.

This study involves a field experiment around the scale-up of the GSFP, including 116 primary schools in 58 districts. 
The randomly assigned interventions are:
1. School feeding programme, where the standard GSFP is implemented
2. 'Home-grown' school feeding (HGSF+) group, including schools and communities where the Ghana School Feeding Programme is implemented in addition to district-level training of community-based organizations and local government
3. Control group, including schools and household from communities where the intervention will be implemented at the end of the trial (preferably without informing schools and households of impending intervention).

A total of 2626 households in 116 school catchment areas were surveyed at baseline. Households are selected at random from village-level listings.

Primary outcomes include: child health and nutritional status (BMI-for-age and height-for-age z-scores); school participation; learning (maths and literacy); cognition (raven and digit span); and smallholder farmer income, sales and production. Intermediate outcomes along the agriculture. nutrition and education pathways are also measured. The evaluation follows a mixed-method approach, including child-, household-, school- and community-level surveys as well as focus group discussions with project stakeholders.
