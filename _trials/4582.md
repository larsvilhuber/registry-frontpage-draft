abstract: "This study empirically investigates the causal link between news consumersâ€™ self-selective exposure to like-minded partisan media and political polarization. I create a South Korean mobile news application for this study. Users of the app are given access to curated articles on key political issues and were regularly asked about their views on those issues. Some randomly selected users were allowed to choose the news sources from which to read articles; others were given randomly selected articles. To test the mechanism of familiarity, I temporarily boost users' familiarity with some of the news sources during the initial stage of the experiment.

Note that this registry is made after the conclusion of the experiment and its analysis, so that the trial is searchable in the AEA registry. For the pre-analysis plan, see the IRB document for this project (MIT COUHES # 1511295047), attached in this registry. The current working paper is circulated under the title: "Better the Devil You Know: an Online Field Experiment on News Consumption.""
