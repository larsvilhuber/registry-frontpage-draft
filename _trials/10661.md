abstract: "We test whether participation in collective, secular rituals can help foster harmonious relations between religious groups in India. Specifically, we randomly assign 412 Hindu and Muslim boys to attend one of two types of camps, or a control group. One camp focuses on providing civic education, along with team sports, and other activities; the other additionally incorporates a battery of ritualized elements – including synchronized singing, dancing, and clapping, flag-raising, a camp symbol, and a common uniform – which classic work in sociology suggests should foster social solidarity."
