abstract: "There are several reasons health experts worldwide fear an increase in intimate partner violence (IPV) during the Covid-19 pandemic, including economic stress and higher levels of conflict due to physical proximity of family members. Declines in household income are likely to increase the emotional stress levels of potential perpetrators and thereby increase rates of expressive aggression. Moreover, while lock-down and shelter-in-place measures are prudent for slowing the spread of coronavirus, such measures put women and children at higher risk of domestic violence as they are confined with potential abusers and have limited access to support services, potentially increasing perpetrators ability and willingness to commit acts of violence. 

In Peru, during the first week of the lockdown, Linea 100, a helpline dedicated to domestic violence, registered a 30 percent increase in calls. However, higher reporting of IPV episodes may be driven by changes in reporting behavior rather than incidence of violence. For instance, victims may simply feel more isolated, so have fewer opportunity to seek help from friends and family leading them to seek police or hotline help more often. Hence, the degree to which the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic has been accompanied by significant increases in rates of IPV remains an important unanswered empirical question. Moreover, it is unclear which intervention and response options may have an impact. 

To tackle these issues, we are conducting a randomized experiment in which we are: (i) exploiting two rounds of phone-based surveys to a large sample of couples in urban Peru to understand the impact on IPV and intra-household conflict of restrictions instituted to contain the spread of Covid-19; (ii) characterizing couples at heightened risk of IPV as a result of these measures in order to increase understanding of risk factors for IPV and inform the governmentâ€™s response to IPV by helping them target services to couples most in need; and (iii) evaluate the efficacy of an SMS intervention designed to help men manage emotional regulation while at heightened risk of committing expressive violence.
