abstract: "This study seeks to improve demand estimation of free government textbooks in Nagaland, India by encouraging digitization of student records at the school level through the introduction of a new technology. This paper studies the impact of non monetary rewards and the threat of punishment on technology adoption. We conduct a randomized control trial to understand how public servants, here teachers, react to non-monetary incentives that seek to encourage new technology adoption and use. In the first treatment, higher authority govt. officials will provide certificates of excellence to high performing schools and teachers. In the second treatment, higher authorities contact bottom/low performers and reprimand the bottom performers for their poor work. The third arm is the control group where they are requested to digitize student records but no additional incentives are provided for doing so. "
