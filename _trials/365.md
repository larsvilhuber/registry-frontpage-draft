abstract: "In recent years, the Peruvian education system has vastly improved its coverage, reaching populations that previously had no access. Unfortunately this increase in coverage has not resulted in the same improvement in educational quality, and mathematics are an area where Peruvian students are particularly lacking. Nation wide tests show every year that only 13.2% of 7 years-old have achieved the expected level for their age in mathematics abilities. Geographic disparities in this regard are important, since in rural areas this percentage only reaches 3,7%. Previous research has shown that interventions at a very early age can have the greatest impact on learning but also on long-term indicators of income and well-being.

The program evaluated is a hands-on mathematics learning method for 5 year-old students in kindergarten, mainly based on the discovery of mathematical concepts through games, group or pair activities. 

The program has been implemented in 2012 in two of the poorer Peruvian region, Ayacucho y Huancavelica. The evaluation process was a clustered randomization, at the school level. Schools were affected to either treatment or control groups within geographical strata corresponding to the administrative unit they belonged to and their location (rural or urban). It has been evaluated using RCTs methods estimating the impact of the program in short and medium term. A first impact evaluation, an end line study, has been developed at the end of the kindergarten school year right after children received the program and a follow-up analysis has been developed a year later at the end of first grade school year. 

To assess the effect of the mathematical program, we developed a math test to measure children abilities in math and a written and oral communication test to measure possible spillover effects. 

The evaluation shows encouraging results in short run as children in treatment group performed better with respect children in control group. In medium term no statistically significant results has been found.
