abstract: "Most news is not absolute, and involves residual uncertainty. How do beliefs update when information received relates to the validity of past information? Building on our previous experimental work, we test whether belief movement changes depend on the nature of fact-checking (relative to a rational benchmark). We consider an abstract design, where subjects receive information suggestive of an underlying state. We then study how beliefs over states update when signals are revealed to be truly reflective of the state or not. We dub this process "fact checking." Fact checking may either relate to the credibility of information, or suggest that a past signal was instead reflective of a different state. Our design also allows us to study how fact-checking one piece of information influences subject beliefs over the validity of other pieces of information. We considers a rich comparison of modes of fact-checking, which allows us to study whether bias in the form of fact-checking leads to subjects either disregarding or overinterpreting the meaning of a fact-checking.
