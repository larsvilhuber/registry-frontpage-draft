abstract: "Active labour market policies (ALMP) to combat unemployment are used in most countries. Traditionally, public authorities have conducted these policies, but recently, some countries have contracted out ALMPs to private providers. The intention is to increase cost-efficiency by creating a market, where there are financial incentives for the private providers to perform. This randomized trial examines private provision of job-search assistance in Sweden. We will focus a program named Krom, which is governed by the Swedish Public Employment Services (SPES), but privat companies provide all job-search assistance services to the job seekers who participate in the program. The trial focuses on overall effects of the private provider program and the impact of the compensation scheme, aiming to answer how compensation scheme for the private providers could be designed. Relevant outcomes include e.g. the support given to the job seekers, employment outcomes and job quality.
