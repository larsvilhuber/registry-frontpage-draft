abstract: "We give students the possibility to select a goal grade for their course. Students are told that if they reach their goal grade or higher, they will be paid a prize. We will compare the chosen goals with their past grades and with the goals selected by another group of students who are not incentivized. Finally, we will test whether such incentivized goals have any impact in the students' course performance with respect to a group that chose non-incentivized goals and a control group."
