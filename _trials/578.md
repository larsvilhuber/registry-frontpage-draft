abstract: "This trial aims to reduce the alcohol consumption of school students in Lviv, Ukraine. The trial design is by BIT and the project is in collaboration with the UNDP, and Samopomich. The trial will test an intervention focused around increasing the number of alternative extra-curricular activities for children as well as increasing information on them.The intervention, aimed at reducing the alcohol consumption of school students, has been designed with two specific behavioural insights in mind. The first is that the challenge of creating a successful intervention is made greater by the ‘Romeo and Juliet’ effect – the tendency, especially strong in young people, to actively react against being told what to do. The second is that talking about how bad the problem of teenage drinking may inadvertently increase the salience of drinking and lead to students thinking more of their peers drink than actually do. The intervention will therefore have two key components: 1) New activities - increasing the number of desirable alternative after-school activities for children, 2) Information on activities - increasing information on all after-school activities. The design is a cluster randomised trial with 10 schools out of 20 randomly assigned to receive the 'substitution activities' intervention.
