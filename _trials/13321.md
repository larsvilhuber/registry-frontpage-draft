abstract: "We run a choice experiment that induces exogenous variation in job attributes. The key features of the experimental design follows Maestas et al. (2023). We aim at identifying workers' willingness to pay for firm training. Additionally, we investigate willingness to pay for other job attributes, in particular working hours, flexibility, autonomy, contract type and leadership."
