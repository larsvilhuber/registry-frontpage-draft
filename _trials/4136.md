abstract: "The ability to complete academic work in a timely manner is critical to students’ success at school. This project builds on insights from behavioural economics to investigate the mechanisms responsible for students’ tendency to procrastinate in their studies and to test simple interventions to overcome procrastination problems. We randomise a large sample of senior secondary students in Australia into a baseline and three treatment groups, in which we observe the timing and success of completion of a sustained real effort task. Treatments vary based on the length of the deadline given to complete the task and on whether students receive a reminder (unanticipated or anticipated) to do the task. In a second step, we elicit experimental measures of impatience and present bias, which are theoretically linked to procrastination behaviour, of these students to investigate how empirically observed procrastination behaviour correlates with students’ time preferences. Finally, we link our behavioural measures to administrative data to examine whether present-biased preferences and procrastination behaviour are predictive of students’ university entrance scores."
