abstract: "The behavioral relevance of non-binding defaults is well established. A central reason for
why defaults may affect choices is that they entail implicit recommendations (McKenzie
et al., 2006; Altmann et al., 2018), i.e., they function as a mode of communication between
default setters and decision makers. This naturally raises the question how communication
through defaults differs from other forms of communication. We conduct a laboratory experiment
to analyze the extent to which default options differ from direct advice."
