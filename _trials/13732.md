abstract: "Despite significant increases in primary school enrollment, the quality of education remains a pressing issue, especially in rural areas with limited resources and infrastructure. This randomized controlled trial examines the impact of the Offline Libraries program, an educational initiative led by an international NGO, on student learning and teaching quality in a remote area. The study involves 140 public primary schools, with 70 receiving the intervention and 70 serving as controls. The intervention deploys digital libraries, which provide educational materials accessible without an internet connection, as well as tablets for students and a SD card for teachers to access these resources. The program also includes comprehensive teacher training and ongoing pedagogical support.

We hypothesize that the program can improve teaching practices, increase student engagement, and enhance learning outcomes. To investigate these questions, analyses will be based on surveys, classroom observations, and administrative data, focusing on students and teachers in grades 4 and 6. The study provides insights into the effectiveness of digital educational tools in resource-limited settings. Findings will inform policymakers and stakeholders about scalable interventions to address educational disparities in remote and underserved regions."
