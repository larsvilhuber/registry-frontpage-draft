abstract: "Within two regions (USA and China) of a large chemical company, we implement a random change in the spot reward system of administrative employees. Employees elected to receive a monetary spot reward during the year 2020 are randomly divided into two groups – one group without any changes and thus a monetary payment and another group with the option to choose between vacation days instead of money. Our main aim is to study possible changes in employees’ satisfaction and engagement when they face the option to choose between different bonus types offered by their employer.  We are also interested in whether there are changes in commitment and performance, whether this change is different between countries and whether there are changes in team dynamics such as team collaboration."
