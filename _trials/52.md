abstract: "Amid growing recognition that girl-specific interventions can be effective and increased recognition of the importance of emotional and social learning, a number of programs have been developed with the aim of impacting girls' aspirations and so-called "soft skills."  This study will evaluate the direct and indirect effects of one such program on girls, the most effective mode of delivery of the said program, additional effects of the program on others such as parents or male students, and overall, the effectiveness of efforts at improving girls’ selfesteem, aspirations, and soft skills as a mechanism for improving girls’ educational outcomes, specifically girls’ enrollment and retention in secondary school.  The study will further investigate the effect of such programs on girls' social networks and the means through which soft skills spread through networks. 
A network component of the study will examine endogenous and exogenous network formation and the subsequent effects of network changes."
