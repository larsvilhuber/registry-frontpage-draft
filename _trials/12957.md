abstract: "This study evaluates the impact of the educational game "Good Life for All" on learning outcomes and values based on the 17 SDGs created by the United Nations, among advanced secondary schools. This study aims to determine if the educational game influences competence and the development of personal values. Additionally, it seeks to explore potential variations in this influence across diverse cultural contexts, such as Germany and Zanzibar (Tanzania). The game instructs students on considering both individual preferences and societal interests in economic decision-making. Also, it is set to emphasize the disparities between the Global North and South. The investigation employs both quantitative and qualitative analyses of competence and attitude development. In both Germany and Tanzania, the study is conducted with the participation of five schools from each country. Participants are allocated into experimental and control groups, completing identical questionnaires before and after engaging with the game to measure learning outcomes. Moreover, a follow-up assessment six months later provides insights into long-term effects. The study formulates several hypotheses, anticipating overall enhancements in learning outcomes, a potentially heightened impact of the game in Tanzania, and the sustained retention of acquired knowledge. The outcomes are expected to illuminate the efficacy of the game and reveal potential cultural disparities in competence and value development. The study aligns with existing research examining the effects of educational games in various educational settings. For instance, Klassen and Willoughby (2003) investigated the use of educational games as instructional tools, indicating positive impacts on students' understanding of complex concepts. Additionally, studies by Obro (2023), Ramani and Siegler (2012), and Farrah and Shabaneh (2019) highlighted the effectiveness of educational games in improving learning outcomes and fostering student engagement. However, literature concerning economic education in this context is scarce to nonexistent. Despite the apparent advantages, the effectiveness of incorporating educational games into the school environment remains largely unexplored. Additional research is necessary to comprehensively grasp the potential impacts, opportunities for optimization, and challenges associated with this pedagogical approach. The findings of this study could contribute to a deeper understanding of the effectiveness of educational games in promoting competency development and value orientation among students. Insights gained from this research may have implications for educational policies and practices, particularly in enhancing intercultural competence and promoting sustainable development goals. Moreover, the study's methodology and findings could be transferable to other contexts, offering valuable insights for educators and policymakers globally. Future research could explore long-term effects and additional factors influencing the effectiveness of educational games, further advancing the field of educational technology and pedagogy.
