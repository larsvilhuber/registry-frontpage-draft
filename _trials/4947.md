abstract: "Between 2011-20, floods caused over 45,000 deaths with most occurring in lower-income countries. Early warning systems (EWS) for floods can lower human and economic losses, and improve post-flood recovery. But, underdeveloped dissemination infrastructure in lower income countries typically limits their reach and adoption by the most vulnerable: poor less educated citizens in more remote areas. Cost-effective infrastructure investments are also hindered by a lack of rigorous evidence on how best to relay flood alerts at scale. In collaboration with the engineering team at Googleâ€™s flood forecasting initiative, we will conduct the first experimental evaluation of a flood EWS in India; it will pair cutting-edge forecasting and android-based alerting system with grassroots volunteers armed with android phones and trained in community outreach activities. We anticipate research insights on how to disseminate time-sensitive forecasts that encourage high-cost, higher-return avoidance behavior in response to environmental stressors induced by climate change.
