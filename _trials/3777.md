abstract: "Rapid urbanization exacerbates public service challenges that disproportionately affect poor residents of informal settlements. The literature focuses on the barriers to and impact of access to basic services, such as water and sanitation, but public streetlighting is understudied. However, observational studies suggest that public lighting may help people feel safe, as well as access shared infrastructure, such as toilets, after dark. In South Africa, existing policies promote high-mast lights in informal settlements, despite concerns that they provide dim light and cast strong shadows, except in areas directly under the light. We use a cluster randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy and impact of one alternative — solar public lights mounted onto residents’ houses — in a Cape Town informal settlement. We test whether these lights provide effective public lighting and overcome obstacles to conventional streetlights in informal settlements. We use novel pedestrian motion sensors to measure nighttime mobility, lux meters to measure brightness, service requests to measure theft, vandalism, and malfunction, as well as surveys to measure nighttime outdoor activities, perceptions of safety, infrastructure satisfaction, and experience of crime. This study is the first, to our knowledge, to test the impact of public lighting on life at night in an informal settlement."
