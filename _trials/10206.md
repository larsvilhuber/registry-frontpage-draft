abstract: "Important decisions, such as those related to academic or job choices, can have a huge impact in peopleâ€™s life. Although the evidence on social choice theory is substantial, the causal evidence using an economics framework is still insufficient. In this paper we propose a causal framework to analyse the impact of self-efficacy, outcome expectation and social image on the decision of high school students to study economics in university. For this, we propose a randomized controlled trial with two interventions, one focused on improving economic literacy of students and a second one focused on changing stereotypes often associated with economists. To analyse our framework, causal mediation analysis and heterogeneity analysis will be used. As secondary outcome, we want to verify the effect of the treatment among different political preferences, gender, and socio-economic status."
