abstract: "We will explore individuals' selling behavior when they hold multiple indivisible units of a good and encounter buyers stochastically, each offering to purchase a limited number of units at a per-unit price. The experiment thus examines the dynamic selling behavior of sellers when they face uncertainty about future opportunities to sell their items."
