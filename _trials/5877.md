abstract: "The novel coronavirus and the associated illness COVID-19 have spread rapidly across the world, posing grave threats to public health and economic well being. Until testing or a vaccine are available at a global scale, slowing the virus requires reductions in interpersonal contact and increased hygiene like hand washing. We propose a set of experiments that evaluate a social influence campaign intended to spread information and encourage the practice of protective behaviors. The experiments will speak to the underlying mechanisms driving the effects of a social influence campaign, allowing policymakers to design high-impact campaigns in response to this and future crises."
