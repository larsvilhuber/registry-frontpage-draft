abstract: "Young adults are less financially literate than the average population. At the same time, they would benefit the most from receiving financial education starting their adult lives, when they start earning money and managing their personal finances. In particular, financial education can be key for low-income post-secondary scholarship recipients, young adults who receive a stipend and have to manage it for the first time in their lives. We run a randomized control trial at the individual level to estimate the impacts of the online asynchronous financial education program #PorMiCuenta on the financial knowledge, abilities, and behavior of Peruvian government (Beca 18) scholarship recipients. The financial education program uses an edutainment approach, with materials appealing to the youth."
