abstract: "In the experimental literature, social norms are identified by using the method developed by Krupka and Weber (2013).
We plan to replicate the Krupka and Weber experimental design for eliciting social norms using coordination games with simple modifications to test whether these modifications lead to similar or different elicited norms.
