abstract: "Microplastic contamination in beverages, stemming from plastic packaging, has emerged as a notable concern. While earlier studies largely centered on consumer behavior regarding the environmental impact of discarded bottles and the ensuing spread of microplastics throughout the ecosphere, recent advancements in food science reveal a direct health risk: the immediate contamination of beverages by their plastic packaging. This shifts the perception of the issue from a broad public good, environmental concern to a private, individual health risk. Using a choice experiment, this study assessed consumer willingness-to-pay (WTP) for beverages in plastic and non-plastic packaging with distinct information treatments. We separated the WTP values associated with broad environmental concerns about microplastic pollution from those tied to the direct health risks of packaging. We also gauged the potential impact of varied warning labels, highlighting environmental risks, direct health risks, or both, on consumer demand. Our findings provide insight into evolving consumer behaviors as broad public concerns transition to individualized risks. Furthermore, the results offer vital insights for the beverage industry and policymakers in tailoring packaging approaches to both environmental and health imperatives."
