abstract: "A fundamental operational decision faced by museums and other major cultural institutions is the design of a display arrangement for their collection of items (artworks, objects, media contents), which in turn affects the visitors' interactions with the offered experiences. In this project, we collaborate with the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam to carry out experiments that help us causally identify potential links between layout-level decisions made by the experience providers and the visitor engagement, satisfaction levels, and learnings. The multimedia guides provided by the museum help us record visitors' movements and activities across time and space through granular event logs. Hence, the visitors navigate through both the physical layout, i.e. the arrangement of exhibits on display, and the digital layout, i.e. the "tour" of artworks recommended by the multimedia guide.  In this study, we intend to analyse the interplay between these two types of content provision on the way visitors interact with the exhibits. Accordingly, across the testing period, we have two interventions, driven by our theoretical conjectures, that alter the offerings on the multimedia guides. The corresponding effect on the visitor engagement is measured, on a first level, through a Difference-in-Differences methodology; on a second level, we use a path-based Multinomial Logit model developed in previous research (paper in writing with same authors using retrospective data), to study the differences in the sequential choices made by the visitors across the treatment and control groups.
