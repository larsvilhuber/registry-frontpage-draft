abstract: " Active Labour Market Policies such as internships and vocational training hope to help the unemployed find gainful employment by improving the supply of skilled labor. At their best, such programs can provide fertile learning opportunities for their beneficiaries. We explore a potential way to boost the learning channel in internships  with a large South African non-profit organisation that facilitates entry-level internships for unemployed black youth. Qualitative work we have undertaken with these interns reveals that there is substantial variation in how interns view and approach the work experience -- with some treating the opportunity as a springboard for a (hoped-for) career, and others seeing it more simply as an opportunity to earn some money. Workers who value the internship as a learning as well as an earning opportunity may benefit more from it. In this study we implement an RCT in which we attempt to nudge workers into adopting an approach towards the work experience in which the internship itself is seen as a valuable learning opportunity. To this end, a random sample of the surveyed youth will be invited to participate in a simple self-reflection exercise in which they are asked to articulate how they stand to benefit from the work experience. Outcomes of interest include: Attitudes towards learning, expected returns to completing the internship, job-satisfaction, psychosocial characteristics, and post-internship labour market outcomes.
