abstract: "This study seeks to investigate some of the behavioral mechanisms that play a role in contraceptive decision-making through a field experiment, in which we manipulate the specific architectural conditions under which women are counseled on family planning. The study population is married women of reproductive age who have a need for family planning in Lilongwe, Malawi. Our approach is motivated by evidence suggesting that women’s stated and realized preferences for contraception are likely to be both malleable and highly sensitive to a range of biases. To this end, we explore how key biases are characterized through a woman’s revealed preferences and decisions about a method. We test the following two hypotheses:
1. Women’s stated preferences for and choices of contraception are sensitive to the number of method choices that are presented to them, consistent with prior evidence on choice overload. Specifically, decision-making under the presence of too many choices may either be determined heuristically, in which choices over methods are driven by key method attributes (e.g. effectiveness in preventing pregnancy, incidence of side effects, etc.) or may be avoided altogether (decision deferral).
2. Giving women the choice whether or not to involve their husbands or partners as part of the counseling process is likely to affect 1) women’s decision-making around and choice of a contraceptive method; 2) the extent to which women are able to realize their preferences for family planning.
