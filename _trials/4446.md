abstract: "In a series of previous lab experiments, we let subjects allocate money to earlier and later payoffs. We vary within-subject whether these payoffs are concentrated in a single period or dispersed over multiple periods. Our results show that intertemporal choice is affected by concentration bias: First, individuals allocate less money to later payoffs when these are dispersed than when they are concentrated. Second, individuals allocate more money to later payoffs when the earlier payoffs are dispersed than when they are concentrated. The design of our experiment permits distinguishing between competing theoretical explanations of the observed effect. In ongoing research, we extent our experimental approach in a new design: subjects can increase working on a real effort task in order to generate a greater value of a restaurant voucher valid on a specific future date. When the voucher is concentrated in a single payment, we test whether subjects are more willing to work more when work is dispersed over multiple periods rather than is also concentrated in a single period. Our set-up allows us to cleanly identify the quantitative effect of concentration bias. "
