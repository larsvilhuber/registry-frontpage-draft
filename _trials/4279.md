abstract: "We plan to conduct an online field experiment exploring whether workers value and reciprocate work flexibility on an online platform.  In our study, the additional flexibility takes the form of an extended deadline, allowing the online workers to have additional time to complete the job task.  Although recent research has found that some subjects do value work flexibility, the average willingness-to-pay for the work flexibility may be quite low, with most of the gains coming from the tails of the distribution (Mas and Pallais 2017).  However, even if this is true, it may still be in the employer's best interest to offer additional flexibility if workers are willing to reciprocate the gift of additional flexibility by working harder, akin to Kube et al. (2012).  In addition, this experiment allows us to gather further information on potential differential preferences for males and females regarding time flexibility and higher wages (Goldin 2014)."
