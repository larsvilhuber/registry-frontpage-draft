abstract: "To improve governance and public service delivery, the Government of Uganda organizes community forums – popularly known as barazas – where citizens receive information from government officials, and get the opportunity to directly engage with them. We run a cluster randomize control trial to assess the impact of the baraza intervention on a range of outcomes related to agriculture, health, education, and infrastructure. Using a factorial design, we further test the relative importance of the two main components of the intervention – information provision and citizen engagement. Furthermore, we compare the effectiveness of barazas organized at the district level to the effectiveness of barazas organized at the sub-county level, as the administrative placement of the barazas is a key determinant of the cost-effectiveness of this policy intervention."
