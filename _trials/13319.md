abstract: "New technologies have a major impact on the labor market and change the demand for jobs and skills. In this context, firm training emerges as a pivotal strategy for skill adaptation. Nevertheless, participation in firm training is relatively low, especially among low-skilled workers who could benefit the most from up- and reskilling. Existing literature identifies two primary barriers: (1) employees’ uncertainty about the returns to firm training, and (2) employees’ beliefs that they are no longer used to learning. We conduct an information provision treatment with the aim of mitigating these barriers. Our main outcome of interest is employees’ likelihood to participate in firm training and we assess the impact of our information provision treatment on this likelihood."
