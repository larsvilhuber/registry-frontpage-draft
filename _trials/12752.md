abstract: "When do citizens in developing countries support climate change action, such as carbon offsetting? Carbon offsetting, aimed at achieving a net zero carbon footprint through investments in renewable energy, forest conservation, or reforestation, is endorsed by many international organizations and climate agreements. Previous research has primarily centered on the effectiveness of carbon offsetting, including potential “license to pollute” issues. However, there are growing concerns about how this pursuit of a “just energy” transition can hurt the most vulnerable among host country nationals by affecting the local livelihoods reliant on forest resources. Using an original survey experiment in Liberia, this study examines the conditions under which host country citizens support carbon offsetting projects. Our findings reveal a general lack of support for carbon offsetting, even when explicitly informed of its potential benefits. Notably, when information about violations of local property rights or doubts about project effectiveness is presented, opposition intensifies--particularly among individuals connected to forestry industries. Our study highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of local perspectives in implementing global climate strategies.
