abstract: "We let people predict the outcome of an online survey experiment and investigate the causal effects of (i) monetary incentives, (ii) anchoring, and (iii) participants’ experience in the experiment on the accuracy of predictions. Therefore, we implement an online-survey experiment among a representative sample of adults aged 18 to 69 years in Germany, and additionally survey a sample of experts (economics professors).
Respondents in the representative sample are randomized into six different experimental groups. The first three groups participate in an “information experiment” on preferences for increased school spending. Groups 4, 5, and 6 participate in a “prediction experiment” and predict the results from the “information experiment”. Group 4 receives no incentives for a correct prediction and no anchor when stating the prediction. Group 5 is offered a monetary incentive for a correct prediction, and group 6 is provided with an anchor. In addition, we study the causal effect of experience on prediction accuracy by letting groups 1, 2, and 3 predict the results in the “information experiment” after participating in that experiment. The expert sample completes the same prediction task as group 4.
Comparing prediction accuracy between experts and non-experts, we investigate whether providing incentives, anchors, and experience to non-experts improves prediction accuracy of the general population towards the levels of experts.
