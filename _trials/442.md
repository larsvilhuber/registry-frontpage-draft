abstract: "In this document we pre-specify some of the analyses that will be conducted in a paper provisionally entitled “Wealth, Health and Child Development: Evidence from Administrative Data on Swedish Lottery Players”. The paper, once complete, will report estimates of the causal impact of wealth on health and childhood development. These estimates will be obtained by exploiting the randomized assignment of about a billion dollars in lottery prize money to a large sample of Swedes who have been matched to population-wide registers.

Upon completion of stage one, we decided to augment the original paper with estimates of the intergenerational effect of wealth on child health and child development. Because there may be little overlap between the health problems that commonly afflict children and those afflicting adults, we felt that it may not be appropriate to look at the same health outcomes that were examined in stage one. The literature on child development also emphasizes the adverse impacts that early child health can have on subsequent human capital accumulation; we therefore decided to include some measures of scholastic, cognitive and non-cognitive achievement. 

To avoid concerns about data-mining and specification searching, we decided to pre-specify our intergenerational analyses in this publicly available analysis plan before generating any matched datasets with child outcomes and parental lottery wealth. Specifying these analyses before testing any of our main hypotheses is intended to help make transparent the distinction between planned and exploratory (“post hoc”) analyses in the final paper. Here, we specify our list of primary outcome variables. We also describe some important aspects of the planned intergenerational analyses, including sample selection criteria and the reduced form equation to be estimated."
