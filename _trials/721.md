abstract: "We investigate the role that hope, aspirations, and other character virtues play in helping augment the impact of microfinance loans.  While previous approaches in development economics have emphasized providing services and infrastructure to the poor, our research takes a novel approach by investigating the role of character virtues in economic development.  We will employ a randomized controlled trial (RCT) among women in Zapotec communities who are part of a faith-based microfinance program in Oaxaca, Mexico.  In this randomized trial among 50 community banks, the 25 treated community banks will view an inspirational documentary featuring four successful borrowers in the program, embark on a goal-setting exercise, and learn from a 4-week curriculum based on the three components of hope from Snyder (1994) then applying the principles of hope to a set of case studies involving women in microfinance."
