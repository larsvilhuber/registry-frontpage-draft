abstract: "Field experimental evidence supporting the sunk cost effect is scarce and suffers from identification issues. We illuminate this topic by designing an experiment that exogenously varies the temporal cost of watching a YouTube video, to see how it affects user engagement. We randomize whether the time until a pre-video ad becomes skippable is shortened, normal, or extended. This allows us to test not only for the existence of the sunk cost effect, but also its asymmetry in the gain/loss region.
