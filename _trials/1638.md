abstract: "The quality of the teaching force is the key factor explaining the success of educational systems. We know that teachers differ widely regarding their impact on student achievement, but previous research failed in finding the sources of this variation. Educational economists consider teacher quality as a valuable and measurable feature, but they are not able to explain what generates it. Sociologists identify teacher quality as the consequence of individual and contextual characteristics. Pedagogies interpret it as a multidimensional concept and look at teaching practices and styles in daily classroom routines. This project wants to pool together these three perspectives. We argue that educational economists fail to explain the differences in teacher effectiveness because they look at teachers characteristics that are too far from the dynamic nature of teaching/learning process and because they do not consider the role played by contextual factors.

To prove the relevance of teacher relational skills in explaining the "mysterious" teacher quality, we are building up a collection of the best available tips to improve teacher relational skills, looking for them through international and national literature review and in depth interviews. More precisely, we producing a booklet facing six issues that teachers are called to face related to their relational skills. Each issue is treated not only in the booklet, but also with a very short video. We offered these tips to teachers in a sample of 100 lower secondary schools, randomized out of 198. Teacher used our booklet in the school year 2016/17 and, in within an action-research framework, we discuss the booklet and videos with them through registries on a platform.

We enrolled 198 lower secondary schools in 11 provinces (aggregated in 8 randomization blocks). An external researcher randomized school in the branches: two treatment groups and one control group.
The two treatment branches differ in the treatment delivery: in the first 50 schools the booklet was delivered individually only to Math and Italian teachers; in the last 50 schools, the booklet was delivered in a colletive meeting to all teachers in the school. The control group schools, randomly selected, will simply receive our intervention later, in spring 2018.

The RCT is designed in order to test the impact of our booklet on:
- teachers' well-being (in the short run, at the end of the first school year - CATI interviews)
- students' well-being (in the short run, at the end of the first school year - questionnaires only for 7th graders, due to budget constraints)
- students' achievement (in the short run, at the end of the first school year, and in the long run, at the end of the following school year - administrative data).
In addition, we want to test whether individual or collective delivery changes the intervention take up rate and its effectiveness.
