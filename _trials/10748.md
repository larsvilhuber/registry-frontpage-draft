abstract: "Central banks communicate with the broader public through a number of different channels. Recent research has looked at the impact of this communication on the inflation expectations of the public and their trust in central banks. However, the public rarely engages with this communication. Instead, the public tends to receive their economic information from the media. This research investigates whether the public's expectations for economic variables, their trust in central banks and their understanding of these messages are impacted by whether they receive their information directly from the central bank or through the media.

We seek to disentangle any possible differences in outcomes. In particular, we test whether a close-to-identical message impacts upon the public differently depending on whether it is from the central bank or the media. As a result, we try to identify if there are differences between outcomes, whether this is due to a credibility or trust effect of the source, or instead, it is because the different sources tend to transmit different information. Furthermore, in line with some previous research, we seek to identify how a much-condensed communication from the central bank impacts consumer outcomes relative to the longer-form communications they typically send.  

Participants are asked questions about their expectations for economic variables in the future. They are then randomly assigned to 6 different informational treatments. After participants read the text, they are asked follow-up questions. These questions assess how much of the text they understood, their perceived credibility of the central bank, and their trust in the source of the information. We again ask them for their expectations for economic variables in the future having read the additional information. Participants are also asked some demographic questions, including their level of economics education, whether they are a homeowner and how often they read economics or business news.
