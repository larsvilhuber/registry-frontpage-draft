abstract: "Studies have shown that excessive screen time is negatively associated with physical and mental health and academic performance. While most individuals have access to soft commitment devices designed to help regulate screen time, these tools are often underutilized. This study aims to investigate the effect of raising awareness of self-control issues on the adoption of commitment devices and subsequent changes in screen behavior, academic performance, and overall wellbeing of college students. Participants will be randomly assigned for one of two treatment group: the first group will receive an email encouraging the use of soft commitment devices to reduce screen time, while the second group will receive the same email with additional information about self-control problems. Using a combination of survey and administrative data, the study will assess the impact of these interventions on screen behavior and related outcomes."
