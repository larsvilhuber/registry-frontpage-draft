abstract: "Current family planning strategies center on counseling and providing access to modern contraceptive techniques. But it is apparent that existing strategies have had limited impact on Pakistan’s population growth rate, in large part due to the quality of these strategies. Pakistan’s contraceptive prevalence rate is amongst the lowest in the South Asia region, at just 26% (Government of Pakistan 2017). Consequently, innovative new options to increase adoption of contraceptives need to be tested and scaled in Pakistan. 

We hypothesize that behavioral biases are holding back demand for contraceptives because young people in Pakistan are not “trained” to buy condoms i.e. to have the seemingly innocuous interaction with shopkeepers to buy condoms, demand is suppressed. Therefore, we will make accessing condoms an event that induces less social anxiety using anonymized phone-based door-step delivery of condoms. "
