abstract: "This study uses a survey experiment to examine if wage expectations are affected by selection neglect bias. The intervention consists of two information treatments about average wage gaps. It additionally features a control group that reports wage expectations in the absence of any treatment. Randomization is conducted at the individual level and implemented via computerized assignment as part of a CAPI survey. The target sample size is N=970, with approx. 320 individuals in each of the two treatment groups and the control group. The experiment is embedded in the GSOEP Innovation Survey and is implemented by Kantar Public (formerly Infratest). "
