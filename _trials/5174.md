abstract: "We study the effect of increasing grassroots monitoring on the evolution of public investment projects. Specifically, we study the impact of the launching of the website MapaInversiones in Dominican Republic on the percentage of budget used and on the physical progress of public investment projects. Mapainversiones is an online platform where government agencies are required to upload information about the public investment projects they are conducting."
