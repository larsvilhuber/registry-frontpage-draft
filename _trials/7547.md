abstract: "The proposed randomized control trial is designed to study the effect of nutrition and gender sensitive messaging embedded in the work of  extension workers across four regions of Ethiopia. All kebeles in our sample are provided video-based agricultural content presented by agricultural extension workers. In randomly selected kebeles, these videos will be presented in a framing that encourages collaboration in the household and promotes women to be active participants in household decision-making. A subset of the kebeles in the collaboration arm will be randomly selected to also be provided with video-based agricultural extension that explicitly focuses on connecting agricultural decisions to improving nutrition outcomes in the household. The evaluation contributes to the literature by identifying whether agricultural extension is an effective method to improve nutrition awareness and outcomes, and whether government extension can be framed in a manner to promote female empowerment in householdsâ€™ agricultural decision-making."
