abstract: "This experimental study investigates the ability of consumers to identify AI-generated fake reviews in online marketplaces and examines the factors influencing this capability and consumers' willingness to pay. The experiment is divided into a preliminary phase and a main experimental phase. In the preliminary phase, participants are exposed to product information along with reviews categorized as either AI-generated or genuine, followed by assessments of their authenticity. The main experiment manipulates the proportion of fake reviews and the insurance variable across different scenarios to measure its effect on WTP. The outcomes are expected to provide insightful contributions to understanding the dynamics of consumer trust and decision-making in the face of evolving digital marketing strategies."
