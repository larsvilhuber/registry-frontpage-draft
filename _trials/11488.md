abstract: "Globally, one-third of married women experience abuse from their husbands in their lifetime. For some countries, this rate is even higher (e.g., 72.6% in Bangladesh). Intimate partner violence (IPV) creates tension, fear, and anxiety among women, which might affect women’s preferences. We expect that the experience of IPV will make women more risk-averse, have lower trust in other people, and have more doubts about the future. It might also affect women’s willingness to be involved in household decisions. To investigate whether the recollection of the recent experience of IPV affects women’s risk preferences, time preferences, social preferences and willingness to be involved in household decisions, we will use a survey experiment with married women in Bangladesh. The survey includes a module on IPV consisting of questions on emotional, physical and sexual abuse and a video. This module will make women recollect their recent IPV experiences. To estimate the effect of the recollection of IPV on women’s preferences, we will randomly change the order of the IPV module (questions+ video) and the outcome modules in the survey."
