abstract: "In the face of an increasing stock of refugees and irregular migrants in Germany, state governments together with the federal government have agreed on policies to reduce the financial and logistic costs associated with providing accommodation and other social welfare benefits to asylum seekers. In this project, we study the impact of the policy measures described in the agreement on the intent to migrate irregularly from Senegal. As the German political debate often revolves around the avoidance of irregular migration that is motivated by economic reasons, our study contributes to our understanding of whether the discussed and agreed policy measures can have such an impact on irregular migration. The asylum acceptance rate of Senegalese people in Germany was well below 10% in 2022, suggesting that many migrate who are not in search of refuge. "
