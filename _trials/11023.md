abstract: "We study how job seekers react to information about wages and job benefits using a randomized control trial on a large Swiss online job vacancy platform. By varying the information provided and tracking the behavior of job seekers on the website, we estimate wage elasticities as well as the value of job benefits. In a separate project, we assess the effects of transparency on overall job search and application behavior. We complement the field experiment with a belief-elicitation survey experiment with job seekers recruited on the sample platform."
