abstract: "Believing that intelligence and talents can be developed and changed through effort, perseverance and hard work is what psychologists refer to as a growth mindset (Dweck, 2006; Yeager and Dweck, 2012; Dweck and Leggett, 1988). Experiments have demonstrated that protocols from psychology, teaching students about the brain’s malleability, can help students develop a growth mindset and improve motivation and school outcomes (Aronson et al., 2002; Blackwell et al., 2007; Good et al., 2003; Paunesku et al., 2015; Yeager et al., 2014; Yeager et al., 2016). We build on the work by Bettinger et al. (2018) who adapted the intervention in Yeager et al. (2016) to the Norwegian context. To date, the mindset interventions with positive effects do not include teachers, which is critical for scaling up the interventions. Moreover, involving the teachers may enforce positive effects of mindset interventions by changing teachers’ practice. We address this gap in the literature by testing an intervention, which provides teachers with knowledge about growth mindset research, and gives them ownership of the intervention and guidance on how to foster a classroom climate that supports a growth mindset. Our hypothesis is that the intervention increases students’ believes in own abilities to learn and make them better at utilizing the learning opportunities provided to them (Bettinger et al., 2012; Carrell et al., 2016; Castleman and Page, 2015; Koch et al. 2015; Lavecchia et al., 2014). We expect that in turn, this will make students more likely to choose challenging assignments, show more interest in school activities, have higher expectations about own performance and increase their achievement in school (Burnette et al., 2013). 

We test our hypothesis using a similar approach to Bettinger et al. (2018). First, we provide teachers with knowledge about growth mindset research and give them tools to help them foster a growth mindset among their students. These tools include the mindset intervention designed by Yeager et al. (2016) and adapted to the Norwegian context by Bettinger et al. (2018), boosters to remind students about growth mindset and guidelines on how to perform classroom discussions based on the intervention and the boosters. We then test whether these tools lead to increased incidence of growth mindsets among students using an experimental design with control and treatment groups. We measure students’ mindset using questionnaires both before and after the intervention. In addition to questions meant to detect students’ mindset, we ask the students questions to map their expectations about own performance, interest in school, behavior in school, attitudes towards school work, challenge seeking behavior and how they perceive their teacher. We also collect data on grades both before and after the intervention and behavioral outcomes in school (absence, passing, etc.). We use the data to compare students in the control and treatment group, and by doing this we get to uncover some of the mechanisms behind how growth mindset changes student behavior.
