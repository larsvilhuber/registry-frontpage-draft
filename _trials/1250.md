abstract: "We study how workers value alternative work arrangements through a field experiment. We consider a set of employee- and employer-friendly flexibility options. These include traditional 9-5 positions and worker-friendly alternatives including the possibility of making one's own schedule, choosing the number of hours of work, the option of working from home, and combinations of these features. We also consider employer-friendly schedules that allow the employer to set the work schedule with limited anticipation. Our approach allows us to estimate the entire distribution of willingness to pay across job applicants for these alternatives relative to traditional M-F 9am-5pm arrangements. We examine whether and to what extent different choices by gender can explain gender wage gaps. "
