abstract: "Preventive health information has become increasingly available and accessible in people's daily lives. However, given the abundant information people are exposed to daily, individuals with limited attention and who have been found to pay little attention to health risks and consequences may not seek out preventive health information in their daily lives. In this paper, I conduct a field experiment online in India to test an intervention that increases preventive health information seeking. In the intervention, respondents are presented with a disease experience story related to diabetes. I then measure preventive information seeking in a two-stage design that mimics daily information acquisition experiences."
