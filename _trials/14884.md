abstract: "In this experiment, we aim to test the impact of various information nudges on customer retention rate on a mental health platform. We have 4 groups of customers: (i) control group in which customers will not receive any information; (ii) base reminder group in which customers will receive a reminder to book a follow-up appointment; (iii) social information group in which customers will receive the base reminder and some additional social information; (iv) recommendation information group in which customers will receive the base reminder and additional recommendation information about the frequency of therapy sessions. Our target is to compare which intervention is the most effective in persuading customers to book follow-up appointments, potentially improving their mental health conditions."
