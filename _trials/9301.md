abstract: "Competition tied in with self-evaluation can trigger dishonesty in even the most honest person. In many professional settings, including in some parts of the United States military, subordinates are required to provide significant input about their work performance to their superiors as a part of the performance appraisal process.  In some cases, subordinates are expected to draft their own performance appraisals.  These appraisals may then be used to rank-order subordinates to determine who receives a limited number of rewards, such as a “Definitely Promote” (DP) rating of an officer in the United States military. The objective of this study is to examine the effects of two alternative incentive systems designed to simulate alternative performance reward systems on stated performance in a matrix-solving game."
