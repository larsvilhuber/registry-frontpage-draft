abstract: "This study investigates whether Russian President Putin gains support from anti-Americanism through a priming experiment. Apart from a control group, four randomly selected subsets of individual in the study are primed to have in mind: international relations generally (a placebo); a statement about United States hostility to Russia; a statement by Vladimir Putin on United States hostility to Russia; and a statement by Vladimir Putin calling for better relations with the United States. The study then assesses whether these primes are associated with different levels of support for Putin using two different indicators. The study will also explore whether effects vary by anti-Americanism measured prior to the experiment in the same survey as well as by key demographics including age, gender, education, and ethnicity."
