abstract: "Gender discrimination remains a prevalent issue in India and worldwide. Its manifestation in the form of preferential treatment of sons versus daughters before birth (e.g., sex-selective abortion) and after birth (e.g., unequal educational investments) threatens gender equality and economic efficiency. While strong gender norms have been identified as one of the most important drivers of parental son preference, they are often misperceived by the population. For instance, Indian citizens drastically underestimate public support for affirmative action policies. Such misperceptions may also exist for gender norms about son preference, resulting in a state of pluralistic ignorance: A situation, where the majority of individuals in a group privately oppose a certain norm but, because they wrongly believe that all other group members support it, they end up acting in conformity with the norm rather than with their own conviction. This scoping study investigates the existence of misperceived norms in the context of son preference in India and its relationship with observed preferential treatment by parents."
