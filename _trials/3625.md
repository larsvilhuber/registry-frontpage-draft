abstract: "Helping microentrepreneurs increase their profits is believed to be a promising tool in the self-help advocating development aid aiming to reach a large number of households threatened by poverty. Initiatives tackling the micro-level inhibitors to MSE growth are increasingly focusing on addressing the lack of business skills and managerial capital, with donors and practitioners pioneering a vast range of training courses to this end. Our study evaluates the PROMISE-IMPACT, Promoting Micro and Small Enterprises through Improved Entrepreneurs’ Access to Financial Services, initiated by the ILO in Indonesia and implemented by thirteen micro-Financial Service Provider, short FSPs. The program supports existing clients of the FSPs to explore whether business development services combined with finance can result in greater productivity and growth for the enterprises. As such, it provides classroom training and/ or individual consulting to MSEs, with a focus on financial management and marketing skills. Our research design is an RCT with more than 5,000 clients of the FSPs randomly assigned to one of the three treatment arms or the control group in winter 2017/2018. The treatment arms are: (1) Only classroom training, (2) only individual counseling, or (3) classroom training combined with individual counseling in follow-up visits, all provided by trained loan officers of the FSPs. Our research contributes to a growing body of evidence by tackling the following research questions: First, we investigate whether MSEs in Indonesia on average benefit from classroom training and/ or individual counseling. Second, we investigate who benefits the most from which type of business support. "
