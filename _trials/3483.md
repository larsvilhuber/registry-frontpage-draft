abstract: "The study is a replication of an existing paper: "Beauty, gender and stereotypes: Evidence from laboratory experiments". The purpose of the study is to examine the role of beauty and gender stereotypes in contributing to public goods using a lab experiment where subjects make repeated decisions on investments. Thus, we ask, do people contribute more based on how attractive they are? Do men and women contribute differently?  Do people expect attractive people to contribute more, and hence get disappointed and attach a beauty penalty to them? Our research replicates the original study that examined these and similar questions. The study will take place at Texas A&M University with undergrad students in a lab. We will ask subjects to make a series of decisions on a computer. "
