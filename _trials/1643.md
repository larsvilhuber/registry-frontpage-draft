abstract: "Can social signaling incentivize adults to take up deworming treatment? Working with the Kenyan Government, we implement a new Community Deworming Program that offers free deworming treatment to adults and explicitly emphasizes the public good aspect of deworming. We test two types of social incentives in the form of colorful bracelets and ink that adults receive upon coming for deworming. Different to most incentives that are material or private in nature (e.g. food, cash transfers) the bracelets and ink make the decision to deworm or abstain from treatment observable and allow adults to signal to others that they contributed to protecting their community from worms. We further introduce a calendar as private incentive that is comparable in its consumption value to the bracelet but cannot easily be observed by others. Communities are randomized into being eligible for the ink, calendar or bracelet or receive no incentive when coming for deworming. In a second stage, we offer free text messages to a random subset of adults living in these communities, reminding them of the availability of free deworming treatment and providing information about deworming treatment take-up in their community. The cluster randomization identifies the combined effect of social signaling, learning and reminders. The text messaging treatment allows us to separately identify the extent to which deworming decisions are driven by (i) reminder effects, (ii) social learning or (iii) the desire to signal to others. We further measure the effect of social incentives on individuals' knowledge and beliefs about others' deworming choices."
