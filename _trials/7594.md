abstract: "Making decisions under uncertainty is at the core of entrepreneurship. However, evidence suggests that entrepreneurs lack a method to make decisions under uncertainty. Prior work shows that entrepreneurs can improve their ability to make these decisions by adopting a scientific approach, i.e., validating entrepreneurial ideas as scientists act. Specifically, when entrepreneurs frame and identify the problem, articulate theories, define clear hypotheses, conduct rigorous tests to confirm or disconfirm these hypotheses, and make decisions based on these tools, they make better performance. Building on prior research conducted in Italy, the United Kingdom, India, and Tanzania, this study conducts a randomized controlled trial (RCT) which provides training to entrepreneurs, and explores the treatment effects of different groups in China. The study setting will be entrepreneurial firms in Shanghai as it is an essential economic center in China with a vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem. Moreover, this study also seeks to provide solid evidence and identify elements of most significant importance in absorbing and applying the scientific approach."
