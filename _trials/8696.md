abstract: "We investigate whether the awareness of the taxes that one pays is linked to preferences for redistribution and social policy. We intend to carry out a survey experiment in Russia - a country where a significant fraction of individual payroll taxes is paid by the employer and is in effect hidden from the taxpayer. The participants are assigned to one of two treatment arms: the treatment group where the participants are shown a video with a calculation of total amount of tax and social security payments that typically arise from his or her salary, and a control group with the video showing only the highly visible income tax. We also elicit several survey-based measures of tax literacy, and aim to analyze how information provision and tax knowledge in general translate into redistribution demand and attitudes toward government spending, as well as one's willingness to take civic action and hold the government accountable.
