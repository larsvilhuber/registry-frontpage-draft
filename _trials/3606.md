abstract: "Each year, over 150,000 California high school students receive letters notifying them that they qualify for Cal Grants, grant aid for college that is assigned based on family income and high school GPA. Historically, less than two-thirds claim their awards. The California Student Aid Commission (CSAC) believes this is in part because some students do not understand their eligibility. 

In 2018-19, high school seniors who qualify for a Cal Grant will be randomly assigned (at the high school level) to receive one of four distinct letters, which vary in their language and in the information contained. Samples of the letters are included below.

Primary outcomes of interest include whether students create accounts in CSACâ€™s online portal, enroll in college, and claim their awards, as well as which type of college (community college vs. 4-year) they choose."
