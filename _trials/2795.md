abstract: "We are conducting a large scale field experiment where we randomly assign desk mates in Hungarian schools. By comparing people with Roma desk mates to people with non-Roma desk mates we investigate whether close personal contact to Roma increases inter-ethnic friendship and trust. In this plan we pre-register some key decisions to follow once we receive the data."
