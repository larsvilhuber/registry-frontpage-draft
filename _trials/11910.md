abstract: "How do parents advise their children on decisions about occupational and vocational choices? Is parental occupational advice gender-blind?  This study aims to investigate whether i) the child’s gender affects the occupational advice parents give and whether ii) parental, regional, and occupational characteristics potentially drive occupational advice patterns.  For this purpose, we run a survey experiment where adults give occupational advice in a hypothetical parent-child scenario. "
