abstract: "This study analyses the effect of an information treatment on undergraduate students’ performance, learning behavior, and satisfaction. 
As part of an introductory course at a large German university, students receive randomly either a publicly available information on required learning intensity – or on loan periods at the library. Students are then tracked over their entire undergraduate course including their course-specific learning effort and their exam performance. Thereby, the study ascertains whether the provision of information at an early stage can affect academic performance.
