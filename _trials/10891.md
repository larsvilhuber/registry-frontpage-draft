abstract: "We use a field experiment to evaluate patience, time inconsistency and commitment demand among young children. We first show that patience at ages 5-10 positively predicts reading scores up to 4 years later, even when controlling for cognitive and executive function assessment scores. In contrast, time inconsistency and commitment demand do not predict reading scores. Second, we evaluate whether preschool affects patience. We leverage a field experiment that randomized children to different preschool curricula. We find that children who were offered the preschool curriculum focused on self-regulation make patient decisions in both periods of the experiment, whereas control children who were not offered the preschool intervention do not. Further, preschool helps children use commitment devices to manage their time inconsistency, but does not affect time inconsistency directly."
