abstract: "The research question guiding this study is: how does a firm that emphasizes its religious identity in a job ad affect hiring in terms of number of applicants and the composition of those applicants. In an effort to answer this question, I conduct a field experiment in which I partner with a law firm (Simms Showers LLP) that explicitly identifies as religious. In particular, Simms Showers’ stated mission is to “integrate [their] faith into the practice of law and serve [their] clients with excellence.” I note that this firm does not emphasize its religious identity on its website and other public-facing communications. 

In an effort to understand how emphasizing this identity affects hiring, I partnered with Simms’ Leesburg, Virginia office (its main office) that is looking to hire a paralegal. To answer my research question, I will first locate 1,000 candidates from ZipRecruiter in the greater Leesburg area who: 1) have relevant experience and 2) are searching for a new position. I will then purchase access to their details, including their resume and contact information. With this information, I will randomly assign one of two recruiting emails to these candidates – one in which I emphasize the religious identity of Simms Showers LLP and one in which I do not. 

I have six main hypotheses that I will test in this experiment. First, I hypothesize that among the general population, Simms’ emphasizing its religious identity in recruiting emails will not lead to a greater number of applicants relative to those emails in which it does not emphasize its religious identity. Second, I hypothesize that when I interact individual religiosity of the candidates with the treatment, this will yield a greater number of candidates for Simms. In other words, more religious individuals are more likely to apply in the religious condition. I note that I will proxy for individual religiosity by the zip code provided on candidates’ resumes. I tie that to county level religious adherence as provided by the United States Religious Census. Third, I hypothesize that higher quality applicants will apply in the religious condition. Fourth, I hypothesize that women are more likely to apply in the religious condition, whether I or not I control for individual religiosity. Fifth, I hypothesize that non-whites are more likely to apply in the religious condition, whether or not I control for individual religiosity. Finally, I hypothesize that those individuals who apply to the religious condition are more pro-social than those that apply to the control condition.
