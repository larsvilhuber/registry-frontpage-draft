abstract: "In developing countries women’s avoidance of bargaining with their spouse about the allocation of household resources has been suggested as a source of inefficiency. In particular, women seem to shield resources for educational investment for children from their husbands. Using a lab-in-the-field experiment this project studies whether parental preference heterogeneity and female empowerment in the household cause such behavior consistent with a non-cooperative model. Besides a direct cost, shielding resources from the spouse implies an efficiency cost from the lack of income pooling, which, in developing countries, allows access to indivisible investment goods and insures certain expenses against income shocks. In the study I am able to vary and measure efficiency losses directly. In the experimental design parents are asked to choose for or against joint decision-making and income pooling on a consumption versus educational voucher choice. I set up and test a simple model of bargaining avoidance and income pooling to address the roles of preference matching, bargaining powers, taking into account the potential endogeneity of marital matching. By additionally eliciting beliefs about the spouse's preferences, the study opens up a behavioral channel to understand household efficiency. Parental decision-making is further related to child outcomes. Understanding the underlying mechanism of an important occurring inefficiency of parental decision-making will allow to discuss improvements in cash transfer policies."
