abstract: "With the rise of industrial parks and low-wage low-skill manufacturing positions, more individuals (especially women) are moving from the informal labor market to the formal market. Previous studies have shown the long-run impacts of working in in these manufacturing positions to be mixed across a diverse array of contexts and outcomes (Heath and Mobarak, 2015; Atkin, 2009; Kagy, 2017). A recent study shows high rates of early turnover for workers randomly offered factory jobs outside of Addis, Ethiopia, alluding to potential early negative experiences in industrial employment in the Ethiopian context (Blattman and Dercon, 2018). This project has two objectives. First, using detailed high frequency data it will document the experience of newly hired women working in Ethiopian manufacturing, examining the level and evolution of their economic empowerment and household bargaining power as they move through their first three months of employment. We will explore how these measures of well-being interact with both these womenâ€™s baseline characteristics, as well as later absenteeism, retention and performance on the job. Second, this project will evaluate how giving individuals information about (1) how to make a financial plan given their income sources and their expenses, and (2) information about their own time preferences may improve upon these welfare and job outcomes."
