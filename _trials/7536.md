abstract: "We study the effect of performance thresholds on effort and risk-taking in economic decisions. Using a theoretical model, we show that if action is required to meet the threshold, then effort unambiguously increases. The effect of the threshold on risk taking is ambiguous: risk taking increases for thresholds of intermediate levels and decreases otherwise. Our experiment tests whether effort and risk-taking are affected by thresholds of different difficulty. It then studies whether these effects are in line with the model. "
