abstract: "The impact evaluation of the Philippine cash transfer program seeks to answer the following question: What is the causal impact of the cash transfer program on the beneficiaries’ health, education, and poverty indicators of interest? This is the fundamental evaluation question relating to the effectiveness of the designed cash transfer program for the Philippines. The results are intended to help guide government decisions related to program sustainability and scale-up. A broad range of outcomes will be assessed in order to evaluate the impact across a variety of dimensions. The interaction between this demand-side intervention and supply-side conditions (i.e. the state of the education and health facilities) will also be studied. The impact evaluation will also seek to validate the quasi-experimental regression discontinuity method vis-à-vis the RCT approach. This evaluation is focused directly on the relatively short-run impacts of the implementation of 4Ps (i.e. 28 months after the beginning of program implementation in RD only areas and 18 months in RCT areas). Future rounds of evaluation analysis could focus on medium- to long-run impacts, as well as potentially integrate other types of policy reform (for example supply-side interventions) and study their interaction with conditional cash transfers."
