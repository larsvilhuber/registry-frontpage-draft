abstract: "In this online experiment, we study the extent to which financial incentives change behaviour by 1) altering the pecuniary costs and benefits associated with actions or by 2) conveying non-price information. We construct an economic game (n = 3,657) in which some participants (‘employers’) set the salary (‘incentive’) that other participants (‘employees’) earn when completing an effort task on behalf of a charity (‘client’). Employers must choose from one of two possible incentive schemes; however, some employers are then randomly chosen to have their choices reversed. The structure of the game allows us to estimate whether the employers’ choice of incentives affects the behaviour of employees, holding constant the financial incentives that employees face. "
