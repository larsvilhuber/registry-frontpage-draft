abstract: "This study investigates attitudes towards climate change and risk perceptions in rural Mozambique. We designed a text message campaign to understand whether text messaging can help enhance understanding of climate change. The campaign comprises a set of four messages defining climate change and asking respondents to discuss it with their families and friends. Participants were randomly selected to receive the campaign on their mobile phone. We employ a survey to collect measures of understanding climate change, risk perceptions related to phenomena associated with climate change, perceptions about the consequences of climate change, and mobilization."
