abstract: "A growing body of literature points to the key role of socio-emotional skills in predicting educational success. Among these skills, grit – passion and perseverance in the pursuit of long-term goals (Duckworth et al., 2007) – has been shown to predict educational success over and beyond innate ability. We designed and implemented an intervention into the country-wide curriculum of middle school students in FYR Macedonia aimed at cultivating grit by teaching students the fundamentals of deep practice: setting and pursuing stretch goals through repeat effort, using effective self-regulation strategies, and adopting growth mindsets (Eskreis-Winkler et al., forthcoming). It also aimed at evoking positive role models and reducing stereotype threat, especially for girls and Roma children. The intervention, which comprises five consecutive sessions delivered during a school semester to students in 6th and 7th grade in FYR Macedonia, was delivered as part of an existing one-hour class in the Ministry of National Education and Science curriculum aimed at cultivating general life and civic skills. It is implemented as a multi-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial at the school level: the first treatment arm relies on student following a self-learning curriculum, whereas the second treatment relies on a teacher-delivered curriculum using the same content. The impact of the intervention on student attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, and educational outcomes is evaluated. "
