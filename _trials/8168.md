abstract: "We conduct a field experiment in a large, public firm to test whether AI-based recommendations for workers and leaders can improve productivity individually and in a team setting.  The AI-based recommendations are customized from comprehensive and granular data on employee activity throughout the day. We randomize the content and the nature of the recommendations, and aim to study how these interventions influence workers' productivity, work patterns, and cooperative behavior."
