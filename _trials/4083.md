abstract: "Experimental evidence is used to measure the sunk cost effect, and to evaluate the relationship between it and different measures of intelligence and reflective thinking, including fluid intelligence (Raven's progressive matrices), crystallised intelligence (International Cognitive Ability Resource: verbal reasoning item), the cognitive reflection test and openness from the Big Five Personality Inventory. In addition, the introduced experimental measure is used to validate an accessible scale-based (eighteen-item) measure for the sunk-cost effect based on self-reported choices in hypothetical scenarios."
