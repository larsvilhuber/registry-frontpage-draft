abstract: "The goal of this study is to understand the differential impact of two types of crises, climate change-induced disasters and Covid-19, on women's (as opposed to men's) political preferences and behavior in Bangladesh. Each exogenous shock disproportionately increases the risks and responsibilities women bear for ensuring personal and familial survival, with divergent structural impacts that may either expand or diminish the scope of female agency, respectively. We expect that each exogenous shock will alter women's preferences for redistribution. However, a given woman's ability to translate new preferences into collective action in favor of institutional or policy changes should vary based on the nature of the shock(s) to which she is exposed. Our intuition follows evidence that state-led redistribution of wealth is triggered by mass conscription for war, which disproportionately harms the least wealthy (Scheve and Stasavage, 2016, 2012). If exposure to the crisis of climate change-induced weather shocks---and Covid-19---operates similarly to conflict-based crisis, it should encourage those who pay the highest cost - here, women - to demand fundamental redistribution - here, a greater share of political, economic, and social resources."
