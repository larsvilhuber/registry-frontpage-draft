abstract: "Tamil Nadu is a nation-wide leader in child health. However, poor nutritional outcomes for infants and children remain a serious challenge. For example, according to National Family Health Survey 4 (2015-16), only 48.3% of children under 6 months of age are exclusively breastfed. About 50.7% of children aged 6-59 months are anaemic. Rates of full immunization has dropped from 80.9% in 2005-06 to 69.7% in 2014-15. In order to continue advancement in child health outcomes, the state needs evidence on what policies and programs are most effective in child thriving. Evidence also suggests that infantâ€™s health is determined before a child is born and maternal health and nutrition are associated with child health outcomes. 
Hence, J-PAL SA has proposed to lay the groundwork for a cohort study of infants in Tamil Nadu. This cohort study will begin by interviewing pregnant mothers and their mothers/mothers-in-law in the ante-natal period and continue to track the infants through the post-natal period. The study will help analyse how maternal health and nutrition, family dynamics and household decision- making influence infant health and later child health outcomes. 
During this cohort study, a randomized evaluation will be conducted to test the effectiveness of enhanced breastfeeding education of mothers and grandmothers on exclusive breastfeeding outcomes. As part of this evaluation, health workers in sample districts will be trained on an enhanced breastfeeding curriculum based on which they will conduct family based sessions with mothers and grandmothers in the villages.
