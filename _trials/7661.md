abstract: "Women business owners have more trouble getting capital than men. In this project, we run an experiment with hundreds of loan officers in Turkey. The goal of the present study is to document bias and identify precise mechanisms in that context. In particular, we focus on loan officersâ€™ perceptions of the consequences of their decision. Our study contributes to better understanding the causes of gender inequality in business financing, and points to direct policy implications. "
