abstract: "Guilt has been shown to affect economic choice, including propensity to engage in pro-social behavior. I use an experimental design with random assignment to examine the effects of guilt on a specific pro-social behavior, demand for goods with ethical attributes. The study uses hypothetical ratings of products to assess the premium assigned to organic, local, and monastic goods as compared to conventional alternatives and estimates the additional willingness to pay associated with guilty feelings induced through a writing exercise within the treatment group. Based on psychological and economic theory, it is expected that participants in the treatment (guilt) condition will assign a higher value to the ethical attributes. This work is part of a larger research agenda by the PI which seeks to better understand the implications of moral emotions on economic behavior, particularly pro-social behavior. "
