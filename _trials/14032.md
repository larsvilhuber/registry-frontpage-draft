abstract: "This study is based on an experimental design to test the effect of allegations and investigations of workplace misconduct on hiring decisions. Respondents will consider different profiles of job applicants and will be asked to rate their willingness to support having their employer consider them for positions. The profiles will include various records of workplace misconduct. We expect that respondents will be increasingly averse to hiring applicants as their records for workplace misconduct become worse."
