abstract: "I propose an experiment to elicit motivated pessimism about external factors and its eﬀect on entry and eﬀort in repeated rounds of a real-eﬀort task. The task is a simple typing exercise in which eﬀort is diﬃcult to measure precisely and the production function relating the task to payoﬀs is partially stochastic. This experiment is built on a conceptual framework with three types of beliefs formed by an individual following an unexpected outcome: “personal accountability” beliefs which attribute outcomes to an individual’s own performance, “temporary external accountability” beliefs which attribute outcomes to temporary bouts of luck but do not change their beliefs about future outcomes, and “persistent external accountability” beliefs which attribute outcomes to external factors and expect those external factors to have a similar effect on subsequent stages of the same decision environment. "Persistent external accountability” beliefs disincentivize effort and induce premature exit."
