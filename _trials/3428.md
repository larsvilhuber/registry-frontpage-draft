abstract: "We study the effects of distributing free pollution masks on short-term health outcomes in slums in Delhi. We also investigate what drives the take-up of pollution masks across slum residents and rickshaw drivers, using experimental variation in prices and information and exogenous variation in local pollution levels. In addition, we explore how social costs and network effects influence demand. Finally, we use data on the demand for pollution masks to estimate the willingness-to-pay for clean air in Delhi."
