abstract: "We test for correlation sensitive preferences and extent results of Loewenfeld and Zheng (2022). We disentangle correlation sensitivity that might arise due preferences that are sensitive to the correlation of payoffs across states from correlation sensitivity in choices that might arise due to comparing payoffs that are displayed in the same column.
