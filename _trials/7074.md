abstract: "Differences in parent-child interactions driven by child's and parent's gender are a key determinant of impact heterogeneity in educational interventions and intergenerational transmission of gender roles. In this project we conduct a survey experiment to evaluate whether there are gender-biased parental investments in learning practices at home. In particular, we are interested in understanding the perceived social norms that account for differences in parental engagement in math and reading."
