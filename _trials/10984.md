abstract: "Fake news is a global phenomenon that has been decisively influencing our political reality to date. Important features of fake news are that (i) the person who acts as the sender of messages has superior knowledge compared to receivers, and that (ii) the sender has incentives to push the receivers’ beliefs in specific directions. Also, the success of fake news is likely to depend on (i) the receivers’ confidence in their initial beliefs, and on (ii) whether the fake news is in line with the receiver’s (ideological) worldview (partisan behavior). We develop an experiment that accounts for these features of fake news. Subjects in their role of receivers are initially asked whether they believe that the unemployment and crime rates in a US state were higher under the Trump (T) or Obama (O) administration. They can then revise their beliefs based on a message from a sender, suggesting the correct answer. Receivers are informed that senders know the correct answer, are still allowed to send either T or O, and will get a bonus if the receiver’s final answer is T (O). Receivers will get a bonus if their answer is correct. This allows us to analyze how receivers respond to the senders’ messages depending on the senders’ incentives, the receivers’ initial beliefs, and the receivers’ political attitudes.  "
