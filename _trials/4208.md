abstract: "Adolescent girls in developing countries face high rates of adversity and are at an elevated risk of depression and other forms of psychological distress. Untreated depression can have negative consequences on life outcomes such as early pregnancies, social exclusion and school dropout. These can result in a cycle of poverty for young women and their families. Despite this being a very pressing problem there is little evidence on what types of interventions can help break the vicious cycle of poor mental health and poverty.

This research program aims to evaluate, through the use of a cluster-Randomized Control Trial (cluster- RCT), the effect of group-based interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT-G) and unconditional cash transfers on adolescent girls’ mental health and social functioning. Working with Strong Minds Uganda in collaboration with BRAC Uganda’s Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) clubs, the evidence generated from this research will create a better understanding of whether adolescent mental health improves through this cost-effective approach, and whether improved mental health impacts other outcomes of interest."
