abstract: "How does the level of political expertise among voters affect the quality of democratic choice? The answer to this question underlies one of the key hallmarks of representative democracy, namely, whether individuals with the best knowledge of political issues and policies are the ones who ultimately make political decisions. We propose experiments that will address this question by investigating the quality of democratic choice made by individual voters who have the same goals and studying how changes in the level of expertise among voters affect the quality of democratic choice and voters' willingness to participate in elections. Using a novel experimental design we will directly elicit voters' willingness to vote which will allow us to examine several distinct collective action issues that arise in democratic decision-making."
