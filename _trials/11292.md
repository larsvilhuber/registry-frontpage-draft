abstract: "This study aims to understand the relationships between electricity prices, beliefs about carbon taxation, and attitudes toward carbon taxation. The study will survey Swedish households living near electricity zone borders who are experiencing different electricity prices to identify the causal effect of the price differences on beliefs and attitudes using a geographic regression discontinuity design. Additionally, the analysis will examine the role of four beliefs in determining acceptance of carbon taxation. These beliefs include whether the policy will negatively impact household purchasing power, whether it mitigates emissions, whether it disproportionately affects low-income households, and whether it harms rural areas the most."
