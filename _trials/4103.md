abstract: "This study examines the possible different (or similar) reactions of human subject playing an incentivized task (for example a social dilemma such as a  "Give-some" game) either versus another human being or versus an humanoid robot. 
In particular we aim at manipulating the experimental tasks in order to analyse the subjects reactions to "defective" behavior by either human or robot partners in a multi-stage game setting in order to elicit possible differences in the attitude to restore trust towards a partner based on its(human vs robotic) nature
