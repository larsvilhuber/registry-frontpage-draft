abstract: "Distributive justice principles (e.g. Rawlsian, Utilitarian or transfer principles), are central when arguing for practical economic policies. In a sample representative of UK population, we study conflict between one’s preferences over these principles and distributive choices (over income distributions). In case of conflict, we offer a revision stage and find that people not acting in line with their principles abandon their principles. However, the principle of making efficient transfers from richer to poorer (cf. Pigou-Dalton) is not abandoned and thus receives more robust support. Furthermore, resolving inconsistencies between one’s principles and choices reduces polarization in views about practical economic policies."
