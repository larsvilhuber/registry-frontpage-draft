abstract: "This research studies how survey design affects transmission of sensitive information within organizations. We conduct a phone-based survey experiment with workers at two garment factories in Bangladesh to study how survey design affects their willingness to report misbehavior by managers, including threats, physical harassment, and sexual harassment. We experimentally vary whether the survey elicitation method provides plausible deniability when asking sensitive questions. In particular, building on Chassang and Padr√≥ i Miquel (2018) and Chassang and Zehnder (2019), we use hard garbling to provide plausible deniability by exogenously distorting survey responses. We also experimentally vary the extent to which the survey enumerator builds rapport with the surveyed individual and the level of identifiability of a surveyed worker."
