abstract: "Courts in developing countries face numerous constraints that prevent them from providing efficient and fair justice to citizens, or a strong institutional environment conducive to investment and growth. We ask: can low-cost, information-based interventions, using data regularly captured by administrative systems, help judicial officers overcome common incentive and behavioral constraints, and in so doing improve court performance? This note describes the pre-analysis plan of an intervention that will be implemented together with the World Bank and the Kenyan judiciary."
