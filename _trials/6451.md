abstract: "How do markets reorganize endogenously when there is exogenous entry of new entrants? When and how does this influence consumer demand and trust? We study this in the context of markets for retail digital financial services (DFS) / mobile money in Ghana. As markets for DFS evolve, new actors will enter the business environment; thus, influencing market competition. How these markets will reorganize themselves under entry and competition is an important and first-order question, yet poorly understood. We ask, specifically — (i) what price and non-price dimensions do retail mobile money businesses compete on (Quality or Firm Conduct or Transparency or Location)?; (ii) what are the general equilibrium impacts of competition on incumbents and other businesses?; (iii) can retail DFS unlock the potential of existing small business retailers — by adding retail DF as another line of business?; (iv) when and how does the induced competition affect consumer demand and trust in DFS? To answer these questions, we partner with MTN Mobile Money (the largest MNO-led DF provider) and GCB Ltd’s G-Money (the largest Bank-led DF provider) to randomize the expansion of new retail mobile money vendors across low-income localities."
