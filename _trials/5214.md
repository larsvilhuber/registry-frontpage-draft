abstract: "Innovation is a core component of a growing economy. Yet, it is still to be fully understood
how to best foster it. We study in the laboratory the effect of making strategies or profits
salient on the choice of participants to innovate using a management game. To do so, we use
participantsâ€™ generated reports and vary their content to be either strategy or profit focused,
keeping everything else, including a pay-for-performance incentives scheme, fixed. We expect
that participants who are asked to report their strategies will be more innovative than those
who report their profits."
