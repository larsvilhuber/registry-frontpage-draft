abstract: "The vegetable sector is crucial to many smallholder farming households in Kaduna and Kano state in Nigeria, but poor agronomic practices and unfavorable environmental conditions hinder its development. This leaves many households struggling with food insecurity, nutrient deficiency, and poverty. Quality seed of improved vegetable varieties and good agronomic practices have been empirically proven to boost farm productivity and to strengthen livelihoods. Moreover, agricultural extension services play a vital role in disseminating agricultural innovations to smallholder farmers. However, limited access to extension services, coupled with the high cost and last-mile distribution challenges hampers diffusion of knowledge and technology adoption. Research regarding Northern Nigeria has also shown that the access of female smallholders to extension services is more limited in comparison to male farmers, and that they have little agency in decisions that affect their well-being in comparison to their spouse. This research project deploys a randomized control trial to investigate the impact of agricultural extension services and education on intrahousehold collaboration on smallholder vegetable production. It is expected that agricultural extension services will raise farm productivity and education will promote joint decision-making by spouses leading to improved livelihood outcomes for the family."
