abstract: "This study focuses on a managerial question: when agents are competing across multiple periods, should managers reward the winners based on accumulative performance across periods with a larger prize (i.e., dynamic contest) or reward winners of each period with a smaller prize (i.e., repeated contest), to elicit higher effort? The standard economic theory would predict that the dynamic contest is optimal if agents only care about the prize they receive. However, based on evidence from the behavioral economics literature, we suggest that if managers can successfully create a social environment where the effects of certain psychological drivers of behavior become more salient, they could expect higher effort from agents in the repeated contest."
