abstract: "Tax compliance is difficult to enforce when services are provided to private households. In order to incentivize private consumers to act as third-party reporters, several countries have introduced monetary incentives such as tax credits for consumers that demand legally provided services. We study the causal effects of tax credit schemes for household services on consumers’ willingness to demand legally provided services. We implement a randomized control trial within a survey of consumers in Germany. Survey participants are randomly assigned to 1) a baseline scenario without a tax credit, 2) a tax credit of 20% that is granted “at source”, i.e., at the time of service consumption, as in Sweden, 3) a tax credit of 20% that can be claimed with the annual tax return, i.e., consumers receive the credit with some delay, as in Germany. To investigate the effect of the size of the tax credits we additionally implement two scenarios in which the tax credit is 30% via the tax return (scenario 5) and at source (scenario 6). Moreover, we are interested whether participants' willingness to pay differs when they do not have to calculate the tax refund themselves but the final price (decreased by the value of the subsidy) is displayed to them. Therefore, we add an additional scenario (scenario 4) where we show participants the final price. We aim to examine how consumers' preferences and their willingness to pay for legally provided services varies across these three conditions. We identify the willingness to pay with a discrete choice experiment. We hypothesize that the existence of a tax credit increases consumers' demand for legal services and their willingness to pay a higher price for legality. We expect that a tax credit granted at the time of consumption is more effective than the tax credit claimed with the annual tax return and that the tax credits of 30% increase the WTP to a greater extent than the tax credits of 20%. Moreover, we expect the the pre-calculation of the final price to increase consumers' WTP compared to a scenario where no such calculation takes place."
