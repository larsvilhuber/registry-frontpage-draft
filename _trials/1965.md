abstract: "This field experiment studies the impact of an introduction of academic debating aspects into high school curricula on the critical thinking of students. I hypothesize that the program improves general academic aptitudes such as reading or logical thinking skills, as measured by a standardized university entrance exam and a self-developed 'fake news test'. I test for possible negative effects of debating in the domain of (hyper)competitiveness. Additionally, I hypothesize that by debating both sides of issues students increase their open-mindedness and become more trusting of people who hold different opinions from themselves."
