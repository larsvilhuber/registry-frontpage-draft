abstract: "The youth living in deprived areas often try to start new ventures, such as launching a new enterprise, creating a new association or organizing events . However, these youth face a number of barriers to the implementation of their project. For instance, it is often complicated to turn an abstract and imprecise idea into a concrete action plan that could guide and facilitate the implementation of their project. 

The purpose of the “Groupements de Créateurs” program is to help the youth define and implement their projects. This unique initiative differs from other entrepreneurship programs as its purpose is to develop the autonomy of the youth. The ultimate goal of the “Groupements de Créateurs” goes beyond the implementation of a successful project, as it also aims to teach the youth good practices that could help them in every domain of life. In fact, teaching the youth how to design and implement a viable project can help them become more autonomous, improve their self-confidence and teach them to make informed and independent decisions. The first phase of the program, called the “Emergence phase” is based on the idea that young people should be able to identify the constraints that could arise when launching a new project, and should explore potential solutions that could help them overcome these barriers.
