abstract: "To estimate the effect of feedback provided by a commercial activity tracker (Fitbit Versa, FV) on measured physical activity (PA), we have designed an experiment in which participants (1) consecutively wear an activity monitor that provides feedback (Fitbit Versa) or (2) an activity monitor that does not provide feedback (GENEActiv, GA). During a one or two-day period subjects were wearing both devices, allowing for
calibration of FV to GA. We find a highly significant increase of about 7% in PA, resulting from the feedback provided by the commercial tracker."
