abstract: "In this project, I study the effect of training participation on the reference point with respect to a fair wage and how the subsequent productivity gains generated through training depend on the actual post-training wages. I consider a principal-agent relationship with four agents being matched to one principal. In each of two working phases the agents work for 10 minutes on a real effort task. I vary whether the respective agent receives training or can enjoy free time between the two working phases, and whether he receives a wage increase in the second working phase. Both before and after the training phase/free time, I elicit the social norm with respect to the fair wage for the second working phase using a mechanism similar to the one introduced by Krupka and Weber (2013). The results of my research will shed light on a behavioral mechanism potentially affecting the size of gains generated through training and thus have important implications for firms and institutions."
