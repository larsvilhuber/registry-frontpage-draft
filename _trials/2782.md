abstract: "It is a widely held belief that the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) instigates a ‘sugar rush’ that improves the performance, followed by a ‘sugar crash’ which diminishes the performance. In an educational context, this relationship suggests an important role of diet and nutrition in influencing a student’s performance. To test this relationship, two randomized field experiments were set up, with 399 preschool children in 25 classes. The children were randomized within classes into treatment (SSB) and control (artificially sweetened beverage) groups. The cognition and behaviour was tested before and after the treatment in a double-blind manner."
