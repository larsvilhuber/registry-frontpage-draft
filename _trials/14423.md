abstract: "A first study in schools in rural Madagascar evaluated the effect of a bundle of hygiene-focused interventions in schools and showed substantial improvements in girls’ learning outcomes (+0.2SD). Building on these results, this study will run a second RCT to disentangle the effects of physical infrastructure from all the other components of the intervention (sensitization and sanitary pads). This separation is crucial for cost-effectiveness analysis (since physical infrastructure is expected to account for about 60% of the per-head intervention cost), and for understanding the mechanisms through which expanding access to infrastructure can complement female empowerment interventions. The study will measure effects on learning, psychosocial wellbeing, and a variety of secondary outcomes."
