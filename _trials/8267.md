abstract: "In developing country settings where the state's reach and credibility are limited, social media could help connect citizens with government and shape pro-social behaviors by informing and encouraging citizen action. These phenomena are especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic, since citizens often lack information about how to act or might lack incentives to do so. We evaluate a randomized intervention that sought to increase citizens' access to social media for three months by paying participants' social media tax and providing them with mobile data. The endline survey enable us to assess how greater social media access affects measures of (1) information consumption and knowledge; (2) political engagement, attitudes, and views about democracy; (3) attitudes and behaviors in relation to COVID-19 restrictions and vaccination decisions; and (4) subjective welfare and valuation of social media."
