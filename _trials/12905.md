abstract: "Electric mobility options are expanding in developing countries, particularly so in Sub-Saharan Africa. E-moto (electric motorcycle) taxi drivers who rely on charging technology for refuelling must charge at stations that are spread out across locations, where the supply for charging may differ by station, and where drivers may have preferences over where to refuel and how long their e-motos may last on the road. In this project we examine the use of incentives to encourage e-moto taxi drivers to drive and refuel differently. We examine differences in driving behavior in the context of driver welfare and for the electric mobility network more comprehensively.
