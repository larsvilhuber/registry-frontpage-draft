abstract: "There is an overwhelming consensus that procrastination is prevalent among people, and university students in particular. Studies estimate that over 80% of college students engage in procrastination and up to 50% do it consistently and in a way that handicaps their efforts. It is thus unsurprising that a well-established body of literature links procrastination to poorer academic performance and academic failure. Given the high prevalence of procrastination and its negative consequences for academic success, this research project investigates whether a learning journal that features elements of interventions that have been successful at facilitating self-regulated learning and a soft commitment device can increase studentsâ€™ academic performance. Specifically, our first treatment arm offers students the opportunity to use a semester long online learning journal in which they reflect on their study behavior and set goals. In the second treatment arm, the learning journal additionally features a soft commitment device that allows students to commit to the goals that they set for themselves in the learning journal."
