abstract: "What if prejudice were visible? This paper examines the exceptional case of Moscowâ€™s rental market, where 20% of listings explicitly state racial preferences. Based on this exceptional case, we compile an "atlas of prejudice" for Moscow and shed light on a question previously difficult for empirical research to access: Does prejudice in the market distort prices and generate racial differentials in rents? To complement observational data on overt discrimination and link it to differential treatment studied in previous literature, we perform an RCT using the well-established method of correspondence experiments. We send two types of messages to a sample of listings, manipulating the names of the sender (potential tenant) to sound either ethnically Russian or non-Russian. Specifically, this approach allows us to explore three key questions: (1) How does the level of discrimination in Moscow compare to findings from other countries? (2) Is our measure of overt discrimination reliable? (3) Do overt and subtle forms of discrimination act as complements or substitutes?"
