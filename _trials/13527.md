abstract: "The increasing prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI) in job application process raises questions about its influence on recruiters' perceptions and decisions. This study aims to investigate the effects of perceived AI assistance and actual AI assistance usage in application materials on recruiters' judgments of job applicants. To address this question, we will conduct an experiment involving a simulated job opening for research assistants. Lab participants, such as students, will be asked to submit their resumes, write a cover letter based on the job position and complete a technical test.The primary participants in this study will be recruiters, who will evaluate candidates after reviewing their resumes and cover letters. We will employ a 2x2 experimental design, manipulating both the perceived use of AI assistance and the actual use of AI assistance in the cover letters.  By analyzing the differences in how recruiters evaluate applicants under different conditions of perceived and actual AI assistance usage, we seek to understand their impact on recruiters' judgments. The findings of this study will contribute to the growing body of research on the role of AI in hiring processes and its potential implications for applicants and organizations."
