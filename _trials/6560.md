abstract: "Using an audit field experiment, we seek to quantify the extent to which transgender women, transgender men, and racial and ethnic minorities (African American, Hispanic, Chinese people) face discrimination in access to appointments with mental health professionals (MHPs), i.e., therapists, counselors, and psychologists. Understanding the role of discrimination in access to mental health care is especially important given the mental health disparities that racial and gender minorities face: higher rates of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, PTSD, and suicidality. Using a popular online website, we request appointments from mental health providers, including psychologists, counselors, social workers, and psychiatrists. In these requests, we randomly assign names to signal race, ethnicity and gender, and we disclose the senderâ€™s gender identity (i.e., transgender, non-binary, or cisgender), mental health concern (i.e., anxiety, stress, or depression), and insurance status. In this appointment request, we include both an email address and a phone number."
