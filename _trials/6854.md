abstract: "An increasing number of scholars and practitioners are raising alarm about the black-box nature of machine learning (ML) predictions and demand more explanation about algorithmic outputs. Specifically, providing individual-level explanations about why ML algorithms produce specific predictions and which inputs cause it. While more transparent ML models arguably improve the detection of opaque discrimination, help enhance trust in the machine, and allow for more accountability, little is known whether, and if so how, algorithmic transparency causally affects human stakeholders' beliefs and behavior. Answering this question is crucial to understand the potential downstream effects of employing transparent ML systems that may, for example, occur because algorithms change people's beliefs about real-world relationships for the worse. To shed light on this issue, we design a novel experimental protocol that allows us to address considerable endogeneity concerns that inevitably arise in a field setting. Specifically, our experiment allows us to examine whether algorithmic transparency in a strategic setting (i) induces people to change their system of beliefs and behavior, (ii) affects efficiency and social welfare, (iii) changes people' perception and usage of the ML system, and (iv) isolate treatment heterogeneities. In our online experiment, 600 participants have to make a series of strategic transfer decisions under uncertainty, affecting their own and other people's material income. Our key experimental variation is whether participants, in addition to a ML model's prediction about the material consequences of their decision, receive a human-interpretable, state-of-the-art explanation (using LIME) of why the model produces a specific prediction."
