abstract: "Throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, female-managed plots tend to have lower use of agricultural inputs and labor, suggesting an untapped source of agricultural productivity. We evaluate a labeled loan designed to alleviate the labor constraint for female farmers using a randomized controlled trial. In a sample of female farmers participating in an input credit program, randomly selected participants could were offered an additional cash loan, which was described as a labor credit. We study effects of the labor loan on agricultural labor use, agricultural productivity, time use, womenâ€™s empowerment and other aspects of farmer and household wellbeing."
