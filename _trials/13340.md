abstract: "We study depression stigma in the marriage market in India.  We document the extent of depression stigma in the marriage market, elicit the penalty associated with depression with respect to dowry and partner education, and identify which beliefs correlate with this penalty.  We pair this analysis with experimental evidence of the long-term impact of depression treatment on marriage market outcomes of untreated household members."
