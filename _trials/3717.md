abstract: "We are interested in understanding the relationship between individuals' beliefs about the macro-economy and their spending behavior. For example: if one believes that prices will go up in the future, will that increase spending in durable goods? If one believes that the nominal exchange rate will go up in the future, will that increase spending in imported goods?"
