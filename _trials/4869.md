abstract: "We are evaluating the impact of two cross-cut interventions: (1) a cash transfer program implemented by the NGO GiveDirectly, and (2) a market access intervention which reduces travel costs for farmers to access agricultural inputs like fertilizer and improved seeds. The study will take place in 600 villages in Liberia and Malawi (300 in each country). In each country, 100 villages will receive cash transfers only, 100 will serve as control, 50 will receive both cash transfers and market access, and 50 will receive market access only. Surveys will be conducted with 10 households per village.

We plan to conduct two separate analyses from this experiment. 

First, we plan to evaluate the direct effect of cash transfers (controlling for market access). To do this, we will conduct a baseline and endline survey, which will include a host of outcomes. In addition, we will conduct high frequency phone surveys to measure dynamic impacts of transfers, with a particular focus on food consumption and related outcomes.

Second, we plan to evaluate the effect of market access and cash (and their interaction). This analysis will focus primarily on agricultural outcomes. "
