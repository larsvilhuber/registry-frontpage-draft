abstract: "Information on product availability is generally expected to increase demand but such effects have yet to be empirically tested. We conduct a randomised experiment in a UK Higher Education Institution to test whether information on the availability of canteen food increases or reduces demand both in terms of number of visits to the canteen as well as quantity/value purchased."
