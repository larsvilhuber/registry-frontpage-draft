abstract: "As COVID-19 disrupted in-person survey operations, phone surveys proved a viable, useful, and cost-effective data collection mode that has since become widespread in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Phone surveys also respond to the need, in light of recurring shocks such as natural disasters, health epidemics, and violent conflict, for more rapid, frequent, and flexible data collection modes that can become part of routine data collection systems.

However, moving from traditional in-person data collection to mixed mode data collection including phone surveys creates new questions for methodological research. One such issue are survey mode effects, that is, differences in measured outcomes resulting from the data collection mode â€“ in-person and over the phone. The existing evidence on mode effects proper is limited in the context of LMICs; but mode effects likely vary between different topics and question types, so there is a need for broad evidence on the matter.

In this study, we design a randomized survey experiment fielded as part of a large, representative household survey in Nigeria that comprehensively investigates survey mode effects across policy-relevant outcomes covering food security, health, labor, subjective welfare, migration, and other domains."
