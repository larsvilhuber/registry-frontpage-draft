abstract: "Parents frequently decide for their children and are important for children's development of skills and preferences. One skill of particular importance for various economic outcomes is patience. Using a series of experimental measures, we study parents' and children's time preferences, their intergenerational transmission of time preferences, and how parents decide for their children. The latter allows us to measure parental paternalism, i.e., parents' willingness to overwrite their children's choices. Furthermore, by implementing these experiments in a larger panel study, we can link further data on our participants and follow them over time. "
