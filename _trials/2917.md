abstract: "Over the last few years, financial inclusion has been a key priority for the Government of India, evident in the country's push to universalize access to basic "no frills" bank accounts through the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY). While there has been progress towards providing basic banking products to the masses, the path to universal financial inclusion is still fraught with major challenges. Even among holders of accounts with positive balances, many accounts remain dormant. Low financial literacy among the rural poor, especially women, implies the newly banked often lack a transparent, reliable, and low-cost method to access information their accounts, especially direct benefit transfers (DBT) made by the government into citizens'  accounts. As a result, awareness of transfers made into accounts is low. This lack of information about accounts impedes account holders' ability to effectively use their bank accounts and adversely affects trust in formal banking channels. Low awareness also increases the likelihood that corruption can occur at the last-mile, since even biometrically-linked identification tools do not preclude all forms of funds leakage and fraud. 
 
With the aim of addressing these challenges, we test the value of an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system to provide individuals with important information needed to successfully engage with the formal financial system. We propose testing the IVR system through a randomized control trial to assess the degree to which delivery of account information, particularly benefits from government schemes, via IVR helps integrate rural individuals into the formal banking system, increases knowledge and use of bank accounts, and whether IVR-based information provision speeds this process.
