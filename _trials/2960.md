abstract: "In todayâ€™s knowledge-based societies, understanding basic scientific concepts and the capacity to structure and solve scientific questions is more critical than ever. Accordingly, in this paper we test an innovative methodology for teaching science and environment in public primary schools where traditional (teacher centered) teaching was replaced with student centered activities using LEGO kits. We document positive and significant improvements in standardized test scores. Such positive results are mainly concentrated within boys that were located above the median of baseline academic performance."
