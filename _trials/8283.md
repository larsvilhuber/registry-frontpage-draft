abstract: "Classroom-based financial literacy training programs have been popular interventions implemented to promote financial inclusion, bridge the observed gap in financial management and improve business practices among microentrepreneurs. Their effectiveness, however, have been largely limited for a multitude of reasons. Is there a more innovative and less expensive means of delivering concise and actionable financial lessons to microentrepreneurs? Heuristics-based financial lessons delivered through mobile phone-based Interactive Voice Response (IVR) platform might hold a promise to improve financial knowledge and practices. We conduct an RCT to test the effectiveness of a heuristic-based financial literacy training program in the context of female owned businesses in five large cities in Ethiopia. We specifically focus on: 1) training engagement and likelihood of phone pick up; 2) changes in financial behavior, 3) changes in business practices, and 4) downstream effects on firm performance.  "
