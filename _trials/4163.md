abstract: "In this project, we investigate whether people’s support of a behavioral policy depends on the psychological mechanism by which it affects behavior. We implement an online-survey experiment among a representative sample of adults aged 18 years and older in Germany. Each subject is randomly assigned to one of four experimental groups, and completes three consecutive stages. In stage 1 all subjects are asked whether they support training for the unemployed. In stage 2 all subjects are presented with a vignette of an unemployed individual, who is informed by letter that the Federal Employment Agency registered him for a training course and that he has two weeks to object to his registration, and is otherwise obliged to participate. Subjects also learn that he participates in the course. In treatment 1 no further information is added. Treatment 2 is identical to treatment one, except that subjects additionally learn that the unemployed individual did not read the letter and thus did not know that he could object to his registration. Treatment 3 is identical to treatment 1, except that subjects additionally learn that the unemployed individual believes that the course will help him to find a new job faster because the Federal Employment Agency registered him for the course. Treatment 4 is again identical to treatment 1, except that subjects additionally learn that the unemployed individual, because of the letter from the Federal Employment agency, feels pressured to participate in the course and does not dare to object to his registration. All subjects are then asked to report their level of agreement with respect to the described procedure. Stage 3 elicits subjects’ beliefs about whether the procedure (i) restricts the freedom of those that are unemployed, (ii) influences the beliefs about the effectiveness of the course for finding employment (iii) exerts social pressure on those that are unemployed and (iv) “makes the decision” for the unemployed who are indifferent."
