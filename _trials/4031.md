abstract: "Hiring an employee is an essential task for decision makers and can significantly affect the future performance of an organization. Even though some research addresses the effect of hiring competitive employees on the organizationâ€™s performance, little is known about the impact of different competitive preferences on employee hiring decisions. Would decision makers like to hire agents who compete against other people or the ones who continuously challenge against their own previous performance or the ones who work efficiently without competing against anyone? Using one laboratory and two online experiments this project aims to investigate whether and to what extent competitiveness as a trait/preference impact one's likelihood of being hired. The laboratory study focuses on the performance aspect of competitiveness; i.e., are competitive individuals perceived as better performers than non-competitive individuals? Online studies focus on the social aspect; i.e., would competitive individuals be liked/disliked at different extents than less competitive individuals in the workplace? Would hypothetical cover letters be evaluated differently based on the competitive preferences of the candidate?  The study additionally involves a particular focus on gender. We will answer whether being a competitive woman is more likely to be penalized/disliked in a hypothetical job search situation and whether being a self-competitive individual (i.e., being committed to constant self-improvement as opposed to being rivalrous against other people) would increase women's likelihood of being hired.
