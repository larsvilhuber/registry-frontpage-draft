abstract: "New work demands for new pay, and while still many companies are hesitant to change their traditional incentive practices, more and more pioneering companies are experimenting with new forms of pay. One such new pay model incorporates the idea that employees can determine their own salaries. First studies examining the causal implications of self-set pay show higher effort provision, but also document relatively high wage levels.

Even though self-set pay can be, per definition, decided for individually, information about peer performance might still be highly relevant. The main goal of this online study is to examine the influence of performance comparison on self-set wages and to vary whether people are informed about the average output that was generated by others working on the same task. Specifically, the chosen wage levels are analyzed and also the proportion of the participants selecting the highest wage in both conditions (with and without peer performance comparison). Furthermore, I analyze the effect of delegating decision-rights to employees on effort provision by running two treatments with fixed pay, allowing comparison of performance under self-selected versus fixed wages in the same task."
