abstract: "Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) is a cost-effective and key protective measure against diarrhoea and pneumonia, which are leading causes of morbidity and mortality among children under the age of 5 years. Our previous diagnostic research revealed that household members, such as fathers, grandmothers and aunts influence the mother's decisions regarding the child's nutrition. 

We designed behavioural science backed solutions to support women and household members to sustain their commitment to exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of a child’s life. In this lab-in-the-field experiment, we evaluate the effect of these interventions on household members’ willingness to encourage EBF adherence. This evaluation will provide valuable insights on low-cost interventions that could be implemented by community health workers. "
