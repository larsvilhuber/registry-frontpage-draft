abstract: "In this pre-analysis plan, we describe a choice experiment that induces exogenous variation in job attributes. The key features of the experimental design follow Maestas et al. (2018). We aim at identifying workers' willingness to pay for certain job attributes. First, we plan to analyze the willingness to pay for job attributes indicating high work pressure (i.e., the extent to which a job is characterized by frequent deadlines and multitasking). Second, we plan to investigate willingness to pay for other job attributes, in particular of commuting time and the option to telecommute, and how these dimensions interact in shaping the subjects' willingness to pay for each job attribute."
