abstract: "This project aims to provide an evaluation of a Mexican government program to provide financial support to Mexican small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) through a matching grant scheme. The targeted firms are start-ups and scale-up firms that offer an innovative product, service or business model with high potential to compete globally and generate high impact in economic, social and environmental outcomes. We will work with the Mexican government to investigate the overall impact of the program on firmsâ€™ performance, as well as to explore how to more effectively pick high growth firms."
