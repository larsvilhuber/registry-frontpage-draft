abstract: "The literature has studied key drivers of occupational segregation under an implicit assumption of complete information. The representative argument is that women have stronger preferences over non-pecuniary attributes of jobs and opt into sectors with lower wages. However, evidence shows that male-dominated sectors generally provide not only higher wages but also better non-wage amenities. To understand this puzzle from the supply side, this project focuses on the role of information frictions that may hinder young female job seekers from making educated choices in their initial job search. I propose a novel survey experiment on 1,000 senior undergraduates in Korea, designed to test the hypothesis that students have inaccurate information on the gaps between the core attributes of male-dominated and female-dominated sectors. The randomized intervention provides accurate information on pre-specified job attributes of several sectors, calculated from a representative survey of recent graduates. Impacts are then traced on gender segregation in aspirations, information acquisition during job search, search intensity and direction, and sectoral allocation. "
