abstract: "This project studies the effect of social media on individuals' policy preferences. We study perceived endorsements, a central feature of social media, as evinced by common metrics of engagement: likes and retweets. Can the perceived engagement of social media messages affect how we evaluate policy choices? To answer this question, we will conduct an online controlled experiment with human subjects in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic policy trade-off."
