abstract: "Development Solutions and University of Liverpool are conducting a research study to address the need for sustainable menstrual hygiene products and understand the acceptability of reusable menstrual cups as a non-polluting alternative among women in India. The research is in the context of increasing access and use of single-use sanitary pads with resultant waste management implications. The key objectives of this study are:

-Understanding the acceptability of menstrual cups as a solution to girls and women in India in varying contexts
-Understanding the impact of provision of information only versus the provision of menstrual cups on uptake of cups as a sustainable solution to menstrual needs of girls and women in varying contexts
-Understanding of the practical inputs on the ecosystem requirements that need to be built in for effective uptake of menstrual cups

Insights from this study will be able to generate evidence for deeper research on the acceptability of menstrual cups in different contexts and support development of regulatory and policy frameworks for safe introduction of the product in the Indian market and through Government programs addressing MHM.
