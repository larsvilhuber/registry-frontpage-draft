abstract: "This paper evaluates the causal effects of a high-quality, intensive, part-time computer coding Bootcamp on skill acquisition and employment outcomes on a sample of young female participants. Spots ar offered in an oversubscribed coding course to a random subset of applicants in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Bogot√°, Colombia. We do a cross-cut random assignment of: (i) a spot in the course with a scholarship to cover most of the cost of the tuition, and (ii) access to a female peer (in the form of an encouragement to form a work team with another female classmate). We evaluate the impact of the BootCamp on females' labor market and educational outcomes. In particular, we aim to answer the following questions: (i) Does the BootCamp increase participants' skills demanded by the IT sector? (ii) Does the Bootcamp help participants access a job in the IT sector? (ii) Does access to a female peer increase the probability of acquiring these skills (taking up the BootCamp)?  "
