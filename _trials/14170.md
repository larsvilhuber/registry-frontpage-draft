abstract: "Individuals in a group, who repeatedly experience that their group's policy selection system does not decide in their favor, often develop system disbelief. The notion that the system is not favorable for the group, i.e., system disbelief, may be detrimental to the performance and welfare of the group. It may affect group membersâ€™ psychological well-being and their willingness to provide work effort, make financial contributions, or participate in cooperative coordination. In this experimental study, I investigate whether giving individuals a voice, i.e., the opportunity to express and explain their preferences, mitigates the development of system disbelief when decisions are made by a dictator, a dictator observing AI based decisions or a dictator observing borda count based decisions. The study adds to the knowledge on the drivers of discontent with policy selection systems. It provides insights for managers and policymakers concerning the design of such selection systems, especially in respect to welfare and resilience towards system disbelief."
