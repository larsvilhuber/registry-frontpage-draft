abstract: "Achieving high-quality purchases at low costs is the primary goal of public procurement, but realizing this goal in practice is often difficult. One potential obstacle relates to the interplay of incentives and preferences of bureaucrats. Very little is known about how bureaucrats make procurement decisions when facing competing goals under risk considerations, and whether their preferences are aligned with those of the taxpayers. 

We study how bureaucrats make decisions, and in particular, how they trade off and choose between alternative public procurement outcomes. Like many other domains in public decision-making, bureaucrats' procurement decisions are complex and are decided based on multiple features of the bids and the whole procurement process itself. To explore how public procurement officials make choices in this multidimensional framework, we use a conjoint survey experiment among non-probability samples of public procurement employees in Finland, Germany, and Italy. In the experiment, respondents have to make choices between a series of two fictitious profiles of tender outcomes. For each outcome scenario, the respondents have to decide which tender outcome they would prefer to have realized. These fictitious profiles differ with respect to several attributes that are randomized by the researchers. The tender outcomes differ with respect to certain features of the submitted bids such as price and quality as stated in the bids, the bureaucrat's relationship with the chosen firm through previous tenders, the number of received bids in the tender, potential favoritism of local firms and litigation risks.

In the framework of this stated-choice experiment, we study the causal effect of these attributes on bureaucrat preferences and the relative importance – and as such, the priorities – of each attribute for decision-making. We also ask whether procurement choices differ by the respondents' background characteristics on the bureaucrat-, office- and country-level.
