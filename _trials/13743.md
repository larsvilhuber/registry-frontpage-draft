abstract: "This study investigates the productivity impacts of thirteen generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with varying training compute sizes. By analyzing scaling laws, we measure how economic impacts evolve as the size of generative AI models increases. Our research is conducted in a real-world context, employing professional online translators to perform tasks akin to their routine professional work. Additionally, we explore the relationship between the skill-bias of technological change and the degree of automation. Our findings offer critical insights into the scaling effects of AI on productivity and the dynamics of skill-biased technological advancements in the labor market."
