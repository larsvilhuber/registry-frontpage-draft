abstract: "This study run by Electricit√© de France on a sample of its clients evaluates the impact of several measures on load shedding, i.e. voluntary reduction in demand for electricity, designed to reduce load at peak times, and if possible shift it to non-peak time periods.

The study's outcomes of interest include:
- demand reduction at designated peak time
- demand shifting to other time frames
- modes of adaptation, and habit formation by households: does behavior change on specific peak dates, or across the board?
- how the experiment changes consumer's attitude to peak-pricing programs in which the price of electricity can vary significantly with time

A specific design choice is to include multiple nudges in spite of the fact that the study is likely not powered to disentangle individual effects. This is motivated by two assumptions: reasonable nudges tend to have weakly positive effects, and weakly positive interaction effects; the distribution of treatment effects from nudges has a fat right tail. In that setting, optimal experimentation involves establishing a successful package of interventions before further identifying which ones really matter."
