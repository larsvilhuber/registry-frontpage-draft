abstract: "Students often enroll in higher education lacking basic competencies and this is one of the most common reasons for student dropout. This study evaluates the impact of personalized learning delivered through technology in the context of technical higher education in a developing country. We conduct an at scale cluster randomized experiment that involves 71 technical institutions in Ecuador to study whether the use of Assessment and Learning in Knowledge Spaces (ALEKS) during the first semester of higher education can improve short and medium terms outcomes by improving student readiness for higher education.  In the short term, we evaluate the impact of the platform on student math knowledge during the first year of university; the probability of enrolling in the third semester and failing a course. In the medium term, we assess whether treated students displayed better labor market outcomes, including the probability of being employed in the formal sector,  wages, and the type of occupation."
