abstract: "Despite the expansion of microcredit access, its outreach is still limited among farmers. Standard microcredit causes a timing mismatch between cash flow and credit flow for farmers. They have little income until harvest while standard microcredit requires weekly installment. This mismatch will cause underinvestment and borrowing for repayment, resulting in lower uptake rates. Further, agricultural investment is sequential while credit is disbursed in a lump-sum, inducing present-biased (PB) farmers to fail in setting aside a sufficient amount of the fund for later investment. We randomly offered three microcredit programs that differ in repayment and disbursement timing to tenant farmers: (1) standard microcredit, (2) crop credit that disburses credit in a lump-sum and requires a one-time repayment after harvest, or (3) sequential credit that disburses credit sequentially and requires a one-time repayment after harvest.
