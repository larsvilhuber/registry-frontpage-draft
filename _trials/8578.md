abstract: "The COVID-19 pandemic has created major disruptions in education. We focus on Peru, a country with low academic performance pre-pandemic, where containment measures forced children to stay at home during the entire 2020 and 2021 school year. We implemented a nationwide large-scale experimental intervention aimed at reducing learning losses in public high schools. To motivate adolescents to stay in school and continue to study in the midst and aftermath of the pandemic, randomly selected schools will receive information about the requirements to apply to Beca 18, a merit-based national scholarship that funds all college-related expenses for poor students. We randomly assigned the selected families into three treatment arms that provide information on employment gains, current educational achievement, and role models, respectively, and a placebo treatment group that received a standard message, and into a control group that receives no information. We target rising sophomores (8th graders in Peru's education system), because eligibility for Beca 18 depends on the GPA in sophomore and junior years. Finally, we will follow students in 6,081 public schools for at least four years to evaluate their learning outcomes over time as well as their decision to graduate from high school, apply to college and obtain Beca 18."
