abstract: "Randomized clinical trials play a critical role in generating knowledge about the safety and efficacy of new pharmaceuticals. However, many clinical trials are not representative of the patient population the resulting pharmaceuticals would serve. In a randomized experiment, we seek to understand how clinical trial diversity affects physician assessments of trial relevance for specific patient sub-groups and willingness to prescribe pharmaceuticals.
