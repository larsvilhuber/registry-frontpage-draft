abstract: "Existing literature suggests that taxation is necessary for robust democratic representation. The argument is centered around the idea that money is not fungible. Rather, how money is spent depends on how money is obtained. In the context of public finance, this implies that people's preferences over government expenditures depend on how the public revenue was collected. Revenue generated from a broad-based tax is potentially viewed differently than revenue generated from, say, an intergovernmental grant or resource windfall. We explore this idea using an experiment in which people are assigned the role of either "Governor" or "Citizen". Depending on the treatment, Citizens receive either i) earned income or ii) a windfall. An exogenously determined tax is implemented and the resulting tax revenue is given to the Governor. The tax revenue can be embezzled by a Governor, or invested in a risky asset that pays the Citizen $1.20 with a 5/6 probability and $0 with a 1/6 probability. Modeled as a hidden-action game, should a Citizen receive $0, they do not know if the revenue was embezzled or if the investment paid $0 by chance. We also augment this basic framework with a treatment in which Citizens can punish Governors by reducing their earnings by $0.20. Outcomes of interest include i) the rate at which Governor's embezzle money in windfall and earned-income treatments (in both the "punishment" and "no punishment" treatments), ii) the rate at which Citizens punish Governor's in windfall and earned-income treatments.
