abstract: "We will conduct an experiment with people in the U.S., recruited via Amazon’s MTurk. Participants are informed that the study investigates ways to motivate people to follow through on their intention, in this case writing a get-out-the-vote messages. We then ask them if they are interested in volunteering to write a short message to potential voters encouraging them to vote in the upcoming election. We then randomize those who are interested into one of four groups and learn about details of the task:
•	Control: participants receive no payment
•	T1 – Post Payment: receive $1.50 bonus after completing the message
•	T2 – Pre Payment: receive $1.50 bonus today
•	T3 – Choice: choose between receiving the $1.50 bonus today or after completing the task
We then compare the completion rates and the quality of the letter, as specified in more detail in the pre-analysis plan."
