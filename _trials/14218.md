abstract: "This follow-up study to AEA #0012065 examines the determinants of non-welfarist behaviors. In AEA #0012065, one task let participants choose to burn money in order to preserve the outcome of a lottery that assigned a lawyer to vulnerable tenants. We recruit participants to do this task, and vary features of the task to see how these features affect participantsâ€™ decisions. "
