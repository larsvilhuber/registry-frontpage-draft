abstract: "We study the role of leadership styles and the effect of labor market conditions on the choice of leadership styles via an experimental labor market interaction, where we have participants in the role of managers and workers. We implement the leadership styles as non-monetary, performance contingent reward or punishment in the form of ex-post communication from managers to workers: The content or tone of the communication could be neutral, friendly, or unfriendly contingent on the workersâ€™ performance. 

Further details of our experimental design and predictions are included in the attached pdf."
