abstract: "This project studies the impact of taste-based discrimination on the job search behavior (reservation wages, search effort) of individuals. The project is based on a lab-style experiment that will be carried out online. We create an infinite horizon search environment whereby participants sequentially search for offers randomly drawn from a known distribution. At the beginning of the experiment participants are randomly assigned to one of two artificial groups. In the baseline treatment, there is no difference between the job search environment of the two groups. In comparison, we introduce two treatments that allow us to study the impact of discrimination. In these treatments one of the random groups faces an adverse search environment: with a certain probability their offers are discounted by a certain amount (the discrimination coefficient). In the simple version of the discrimination treatment, individuals will not know whether their offer was discounted and they decide about acceptance of offers without this knowledge. In the choice version of the discrimination treatment, they will know if their offer was discounted and they can choose whether they accept discriminated offers. In addition, we vary the different parameters of the search environment. 

The aim is to study the impact of discrimination on the search effort, reservation wages, obtained wages of workers. For this we compare the baseline treatment to the discrimination treatments. We are also interested in how much percentage of the workers end up working for discriminating employers (that is discounted offers) in the discrimination treatments. We compare the experimental results to the theoretical prediction of risk-neutral optimal search models."
