abstract: "This study evaluates how individuals update their perceptions of corruption in response to new information about corruption enforcement. Theoretically, information about judicial investigations or convictions may simultaneously provide a negative signal about the extent of corruption and a positive signal about the level of enforcement. Our survey experiment is designed to measure these two effects and the net effect on corruption perceptions. It consists of an online survey of 7000 respondents in Ukraine, in which randomly selected sub-samples are exposed to information about corruption cases."
