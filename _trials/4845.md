abstract: "Discount rates in developing countries have been found to be very high, at times in the order of 100% a year or more. We devise a method to separate pure rates of time discounting from perceptions of the future as inherently uncertain. We then measures these different quantities while experimentally varying the institution delivering the future payout. "
