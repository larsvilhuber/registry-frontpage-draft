abstract: "Personality plays a big role in people’s decisions and behavior and hence affects socio-economic outcomes. For example, personality traits predict occupational choices, income, schooling, and financial decisions. Due to the lack of data about people’s insurance decisions that is linkable to personality traits, we know little about how personality is associated with insurance decisions and responses to disasters. In this study I elicit the big five personality traits and locus of control from participants who make insurance decisions in an incentivized online experiment administered on Prolific.ac. "
