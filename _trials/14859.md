abstract: "This study examines whether improved contract enforcement disproportionately benefits female-led small-scale enterprises. Stronger enforcement mechanisms may enable women to overcome scale constraints and achieve better economic outcomes by fostering collaborative partnerships with others, particularly men. To investigate this, we design a lab-in-the-field experiment aimed at identifying the causal effects of institutional improvements on business performance and gender disparities. The intervention is designed uncover potential channels driving gender-specific effects."
