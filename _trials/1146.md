abstract: "This study will examine the effect of music on workers' productivity. The setting is a large call-centre business in the United Kingdom, which
has agreed to cooperate with our research team. This study will use a randomized trial to find out whether, in a real workplace, productivity
is higher when workers hear background classical music. The control condition will be hearing no music.  Music will be played at randomly
assigned times during the day.  The identities of the employees will change through time, but the playing of the music will be orthogonal to
those identities.  To reduce possible problems from the multiple-comparisons problem (also known as the multiple-hypothesis testing problem), only one productivity variable will be studied in this project, and only one kind of music will be played.  To gain the necessary statistical power, the experiment will take place over approximately 2 weeks.
