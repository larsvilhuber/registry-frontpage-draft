abstract: "This study aims to generate evidence on the most effective way of selecting eligible beneficiaries to receive a livelihood support component comprising life skills and business skills training complemented by a lump sum productive grant, in the context of the Nigeria National Social Safety Nets Project (NASSP). This study will use a 2 x 2 factorial design (cross-cutting design) to evaluate the relative effectiveness of a combination of interventions that involve: 
1) households themselves selecting a beneficiary vs. default selection of the eligible female caregiver between the ages of 18-45 or other female in the household;
2)  a household sensitization component that encourages gender equality, household collaboration and cohesion vs. no sensitization. 
We will examine the impact of these interventions on household welfare and women's economic empowerment and well-being.
