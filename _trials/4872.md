abstract: "In the Developing World, Public Work Programs (PWPs) are an increasingly used tool to protect households against shocks to their income. To date, most of the evidence on this kind of program comes from one country (India) and uses quasi-experimental methods. An important question with regards to the evaluation of PWPs is how the labor supply at the household level reacts to the participation of one member to one of these programs. There might be crowding-out of family labor supply due to the additional resources brought in by the program; it is also possible that other members, in particular children, have to perform more household chores or unpaid family work to compensate for the previously inactive household member. This paper uses a large-scale randomized control trial of a PWP based on community social services in Egypt in order to investigate how these programs affect labor supply at the household level. The treatment is an offer of a good-quality jobs in community social services, for a duration of one year, targeted at disadvantaged youth, in particular young women. The randomization is done at the individual as well as the community level, in order to take into account possible crowding-out effects of the program on the local labor supply. In addition to answering the questions outlined above, the paper will allow to shed light on the precise nature of high youth unemployment in Egypt (ie., due to insufficient labor demand, or to constraints on the supply side)."
