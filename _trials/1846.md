abstract: "The goal of the study is to determine whether clinical decision support (CDS) for radiology affects the number, type, or appropriateness of targeted high-cost radiology images (i.e. MR, CT, NM, PET) ordered. The CDS will be delivered to physicians in the Aurora Health Care system in Wisconsin. It will be delivered in Epic, an industry-standard electronic medical record software, through ACR Select, which is a leading decision support tool based on the American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria  (see http://www.acr.org/Quality-Safety/Appropriateness-Criteria), and presents the ACR appropriateness scores for each image on a scale of 1-9 with 1-3 labelled as ‘usually not appropriate’, 4-6 ‘May be appropriate’, and 7-9 ‘usually appropriate’."
