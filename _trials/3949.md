abstract: "This project investigates whether new job search tools can increase workersâ€™ transitions, employment, and earnings. Our intervention provides workers information on occupations offering relatively high wages and rapid employment conditional on their past labor market experience, education, and demographic characteristics. Workers access this information through a user-friendly website and smartphone app. Our implementing partner administers employment services to workers in southwest Michigan. Alongside this partner, we evaluate this intervention using a randomized controlled trial that links individuals to administrative UI records. This project sheds light on whether innovative low-cost tools can improve employment prospects and matches. We also learn about whether barriers to information acquisition meaningfully hinder worker search."
