abstract: "Whistleblowing, i.e. the act of reporting illegal actions of a manager by an employee, is an important tool to uncover corporate fraud. Previous experimental literature has studied firms independently of each other. However, competition between firms can be an important driver of corrupt behaviour. In an experiment, we use treatments with and without firm competition and conjecture that whistleblowing is less likely under competition. We additionally explore whether managers and employees form self-serving beliefs about the prevalence and acceptability of cheating and non-whistleblowing."
