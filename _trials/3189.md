abstract: "Appeals to group identities can increase contributions to public goods and induce pro-social behavior. But humans have inescapably plural identities. Therefore politicians, companies and NGOs that want to make use of group identities in public campaigns or in private messages face a tough choice between the multiple identities of their audience in any particular context. In 2014, the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Clean India Campaign which aims at changing social norms for littering and open-defecation. This project will test whether appeals to group identities can reduce littering in a field experiment in Bengaluru, India, and whether local identities or the national identiy are more effective."
