abstract: "Uganda currently hosts the highest number of refugees in Sub-Saharan Africa and is renowned for having one of the most progressive refugee policies globally. Despite extensive studies on Uganda's success in refugee management, the issue of local integration as a durable solution from the perspectives of both refugees and hosts has not been thoroughly examined. This study employs a mixed methods approach to analyze and compare the perspectives and preferences of refugees and local Ugandans on local integration. Additionally, it tests the importance of intergroup contact in shaping these perspectives and preferences. The quantitative part involves a fully randomized choice-based and rating-based conjoint analysis, where respondents will choose between pairs of communities, each with randomly assigned integration scenarios across six dimensions. These scenarios will vary in their level of perceived integration. The study will estimate the causal effect of each integration dimension and determine the relative importance of community characteristics. The qualitative part includes focus group discussions and key informant interviews to explore the meaning of local integration from the viewpoints of refugees and Ugandans, along with their experiences and preferences."
