abstract: "This is a longitudinal cluster randomized impact evaluation of the Government of Malawi's Social Cash Transfer Program (SCTP). The study was conducted in Salima and Mangochi Districts. Two Traditional Authorities (TAs) in each district were randomly selected to enter the study. A total of 29 village clusters (VCs) in these two TAs were included in the study. Half (15) were randomized to a delayed-entry control arm via public lottery; randomization was stratified by district. Approximately 3500 households were interviewed in 2013 (baseline), 2014 (17 months after the intervention began), and 2015 (34 months after the intervention began). The delayed-entry group entered the program in February 2016. "
