abstract: "In this experiment we test whether informativeness of the ordering of collaborators matters for the extent of gender discrimination. We match individuals (candidates) who have previously performed mathematical quizzes, in pairs, and ask a new group of subjects to pick (the best) candidates based on information about pair performance, gender, age and type of university degree. Subjects are paid based on their chosen candidates' individual performance on a mathematical quiz. First, we vary the informativeness of a candidate's mathematical performance by ordering pair members either alphabetically (ABC treatment) or according to merit (123 treatment), listing first the pair member with the highest number of correct answers. Second, we measure the presence of gender discrimination by varying the gender compositions of candidates in the choice sets that subjects choose from. In this plan we describe hypotheses to be tested, the coding of variables, and the empirical strategy that will be used."
