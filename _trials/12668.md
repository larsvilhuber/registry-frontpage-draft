abstract: "Participants are recruited online using Prolific. They are asked to perform a series of decision tasks in exchange for a flat payment and additional decision-dependent incentives in part of the tasks. In particular, participants are asked to rate 20 charities and organizations according to how much they favor them using 9-point Likert scales (see the supporting document). Two additional questions after the ratings ask for the most- and least-favorite organization from the list. Participants are then asked to give binary answers to several survey questions (see the supporting document). The order of ratings and questions will be randomized for each subject (within blocks of similar questions). We
will further measure response times for each binary choice. We plan to compare how the answers to these questions might differ between groups of participants (see the supporting document for how we pre-define the groups)."
