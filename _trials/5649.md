abstract: "The present study investigates the role of decision making on assistance in everyday life. Moreover, we are interested in whether participants decide using a human care giver (CG) in everyday life to assist or if they prefer the robot (R) for assistance (four treatments differentiated by satisfaction levels with aid over ten rounds). We analyze if this decision depends on individual characteristics. To investigate these questions we designed an online experiment where participants have to decide in ten rounds if they want to use a CG or a R. They get the satisfaction level after each round and can then decide about their preferred aid in the next round. After ten rounds of the experiment, the participants have to answer a questionnaire. Participants are paid according to their success (=cumulative satisfaction level). "
