abstract: "This study investigates the evolving landscape of carbon offsetting and consumer preferences. While carbon offsetting alone cannot fully address the climate crisis, its impact remains significant. The global offsetting market has seen rapid growth, reaching a value of $2 billion in 2021. Nevertheless, offsets from the voluntary carbon market are associated with considerable permanence uncertainties, casting doubt on their long-term climate impact and their contribution to net-zero goals. These concerns are particularly salient for nature-based offsets, such as forestry projects, given the risks associated with natural hazards and land-use changes. At the same time, nature-based offsets are offered at relatively low costs and provide a range of valuable co-benefits, making them 'charismatic carbon' offsets, and therefore particularly appealing to consumers. To explore individual preferences in carbon offsetting, this study employs an incentivized framed-field experiment. We aim to understand how consumers assess the importance of prices, permanence, and co-benefits when making offsetting decisions. First, I investigate subjective beliefs about the permanence and co-benefits of available offsetting options, addressing potential knowledge gaps and misconceptions among consumers. Second, I explore whether providing information about the permanence issues associated with offsets affects their perceived market value.
