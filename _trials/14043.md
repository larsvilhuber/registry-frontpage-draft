abstract: "This study investigates the role of stereotypes about gender abilities in explaining the existence of gender bias in redistributive choices, as recently found in \citet{cappelen2023experimental}. 
Using a worker/stakeholders design, we assess how gender bias in redistributive choices varies when spectators are provided with information about the type of assignments undertaken by workers. To this aim, we compare redistributive choices when spectators are informed that workers have conducted an unspecified assignment, a male-typed (visual-spatial rotation) assignment, or a female-typed (facial emotion recognition) assignment. Our findings will contribute to understanding gender inequality by exploring individuals' fairness preferences related to stereotypes about gender abilities. Moreover, we aim to provide insights for policy interventions to address gender disparities."
