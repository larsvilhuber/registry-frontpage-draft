abstract: "Microfinance institutions face tightening pressure from policymakers to eliminate their reliance on subsidies. For many institutions, microloan terms are critically related to their reliance on subsidies. We evaluated how microcredit clients in South Africa responded to changes in loan terms. We found that clients adapted both their demand and compliance based on loan terms, and were particularly sensitive to above-average interest rates."
