abstract: "Ill-health is commonly believed to be detrimental for labor market outcomes. Yet, causal evidence mostly comes from analyses of severe shocks, whereas minor variations in health are not only more common but also a better target for prevention measures. For a first study, data from the German Socio-Economic Panel are merged with data on regional weather conditions prior to the date of a survey interview. While bad weather leads to minor reductions in health, as reported by survey respondents, the effect on their working hours is, surprisingly, positive. The evidence seems to support the idea that less healthy individuals compensate the potential impairments on labor productivity by spending some additional time at the workplace. Analyzing effect heterogeneity across subgroups, the study shows that there is only little variation across industries, but stronger increases in working time among people in part-time jobs. While there are no gender-specifics in the health impairments due to bad weather, the increase in working hours is driven by women. To empirically test the potential compensation mechanism, a pre-registered survey experiment is used to obtain causal evidence on the implications of health-related productivity losses. Using hypothetical workplace scenarios, the survey participants assess the social appropriateness of behavioral decisions made by female and male employees in different occupations. The experimental design enables the identification of the effects of changes in productivity due to illness on the social pressure to work longer and sheds light on possible gender differences in this context."
