abstract: "We study how important information affects vaccination intentions and decisions of the general population. We also want to understand treatment heterogeneity by exploiting a rich history of vaccination intentions prior to the intervention. Further, we can explore heterogeneity by a range of sociodemographic characteristics and other dimensions."
