abstract: "Heal to Grow is a strategy that seeks to promote socio-emotional development and well-being in children during early childhood (0-5 years) through group-based mindfulness and socio-emotional skills sessions with ECD workers in Colombia. To achieve this goal, the strategy promotes the socio-emotional well-being of ECD workers, emphasizing the importance of strengthening their skills to improve their interactions with children, pregnant women, and caregivers and promote socio-emotional and well-being development among these populations.

Heal-to-Grow is implemented through the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare (ICBF) through a network of Service Units (UDS) in a sample of 3 capital cities and some surrounding municipalities. UDSs are early education and care settings or home visit schemes under the responsibility of a trained person for children from 6 months to 5 years of age. All UDS under ICBF serve about 1.7 million vulnerable children and their families nationwide.

This study aims to evaluate the impact of the strategy through a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The evaluation will allow Heal to Grow to determine with greater certainty if it achieves its ultimate goal of promoting the socio-emotional development of young children and caregivers by strengthening the emotional well-being of ECD workers. This evidence will also inform whether Heal to Grow should continue a process of refinement or identify alternatives to scale the strategy so that it can cover a significant number of ECD workers at the national level."
