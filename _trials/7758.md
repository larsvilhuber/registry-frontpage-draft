abstract: "Taking advantage of the implementation of a biowaste recycling system in Palma (Spain) that tracks individual real-time data on the usage of bio-waste bins, we run a field experiment to test the effectiveness of soft-commitments in promoting recycling. The intervention is implemented by a team of environmental educators who has direct interaction with citizens. They offered to a random set of households the possibility of signing a non-binding commitment on recycling practices to see if this has an impact on recycling habits. 
In the control group, subjects sign an informed consent allowing us to use the data they generate. In the treatment group, subjects additionally sign a non-binding commitment stating that they intend to recycle the recommended number of times per week they should recycle.
