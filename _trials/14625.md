abstract: "For this study, we conducted a trial preceding the implementation of a nationwide tool in France to help high school seniors decide on their track choice after they graduate. To test the effectiveness of this policy, we recruited voluntary high schools and randomly assigned some classes to a placebo and some to the treatment. Both control and treated students were asked for information on their history, preferences and areas of interest. The treated students were given recommendation and information on paths of higher education that might interest them, based on the information provided. In addition, another A/B test was nested within this experiment, this time with individual randomization within treated classes. In version A of the platform, assigned to half the students, each path’s information note is clearly accompanied by information on the distribution of grades of students entering this path, whereas in version B this information must be sought out by students."
