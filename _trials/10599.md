abstract: "We evaluate the impact of Save the Children’s Skills to Succeed (S2S) program on youth (ages 15-24) who have dropped out of school. This pre-analysis plan outlines the hypotheses to be tested and specifications to be used in the analysis of the impact of the S2S program in the slums of Dhaka, Bangladesh. This plan was completed before conducting any analysis using the endline data and can thus serve as a useful reference in evaluating the results of the study.

In this pre-analysis plan, we specify the hypotheses to be tested and specifications to be used for analysis of the in-person endline survey. This survey will take place in Dhaka between July and September 2022. Using this endline survey data, we estimate the effect of the S2S program on the participants’ labor market outcomes, sense of agency, motivation and transferable life skills, among others. The randomization structure of the program treatment allows us to causally identify these effects. In addition to these direct effects, the study examines potential wider labor market effects, and spillovers within the participants’ households. The study also incorporates a component meant to promote gender parity meant to improve gender equality in the workforce."
