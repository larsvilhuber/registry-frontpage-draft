abstract: "Current research suggests that poverty can be a self-perpetuating process, leading to negative affective states, which in turn may constrain an individualâ€™s ability to make favorable decisions.  Findings further suggest that internal psychological constraints may hinder the take up of economic interventions.  The aim of this paper is to evaluate the role of locus of control on the economic decision-making of farmers in Odisha, India. We will first ask whether low locus of control constrains the decision-making of farmers. We then proceed to ask if locus of control can be positively influenced through an intervention and further, if this can change the decisions of farmers including whether they take up crop insurance; increase their agricultural practices; and raise their aspirations for the future. This paper will build on a sample of 1689 farmers from Odisha, India and will exploit data from a randomized controlled trial conducted in June 2019."
