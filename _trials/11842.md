abstract: "In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of non-cognitive skills in shaping critical life outcomes (Borghans et al., 2016). My investigation is centered around a specific non-cognitive skill: an individual's sense of belonging and significance, referred to as 'b & s'. Belonging denotes the subjective sense of connection individuals feel towards their community, social environments, and the wider universe. Significance refers to the subjective feelings of importance, value, and personal relevance. This study aims to quantify the influence of b & s on vital mental health and economic outcomes. The approach involves a survey where individuals are randomly assigned to a control group or one of two distinct treatment conditions designed to increase belonging and significance.
