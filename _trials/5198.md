abstract: "In 2007, we conducted an experiment as part of the IADB 2007 project “Building trust and social capital to reduce social exclusion”, where subjects played a series of decision making games, the first of which was the trust game (Berg et. al. 1995).
For this study, we will invite those subject to play the trust game 13 years later, to examine long run stability of trust, the effect of significant life events on trust levels, and preferences for consistency.
