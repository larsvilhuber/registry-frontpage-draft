abstract: "In Kenya, many court cases concerning land, inheritance, custody, and family matters are referred to the newly introduced court-annexed mediation (CAM) system. However, 58% of mediation cases are not successfully resolved and returned to the court, and agreement rates vary greatly by mediator. We use historical data on mediation case outcomes to estimate the mediator "value added" for the probability of a mediation case reaching an agreement. We then randomly assign incoming cases to mediators with an estimated value added above vs. below the median to test whether value added is a robust predictor of future performance and to estimate the individual-specific contributions of mediators to mediation success."
