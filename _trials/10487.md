abstract: "In literature a paucity of issues to measure cognitive functioning in the blinds is available (Rich, Anderson, 1965; Pichot, 1968; Newland, 1969; Vander Kolk, 1977; Nelson, Joyce, Dias, 2002) but in these reviews it is clear that they are not yet widely available without further support for research and development. This is particularly true for blind children. The purpose of the current study is to provide a proposal version of some of the Visual Performance Subtests adapted to blind children."
