abstract: "Decision-support systems can influence people in various domains of life. Firms have started implementing these systems via chatbots and other natural language-based assistants. While benefiting from these decision-support systems, individuals provide sensitive and valuable data to the private industry. By using this data, companies may generate additional profits. Moreover, by making their data available, individuals may also promote the common good. Regulators have recently called for efficient tools to let the public collectively benefit from its own data. The study investigates how people may voluntarily upload their data to a database that is used to develop and operate a decision-support system to promote a public good. "
