abstract: "The Academic Advising Program was introduced at the University of Melbourne in 2020. The goal of this program is to build connections between students and academics so that students can receive personalized guidance and support while navigating the opportunities and challenges of university. The current system randomly assigns students to academics. However, a great amount of feedback has indicated that participants care about whom they are assigned to. A better match between students and academics can make it easier for academics to provide useful and relevant advice and improve students' engagement and participation in the program. In this project, we aim to tackle this problem using insights from the matching theory and market design. "
