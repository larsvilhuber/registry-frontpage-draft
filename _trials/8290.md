abstract: "The emergence of new technologies that allow perfect detection of violations at near zero marginal cost can revolutionize the enforcement of environmental regulations. We conducted a field experiment to evaluate enforcement though smart water meters with Fresno, CA. Nearly 100,000 single-family households in Fresno were experimentally assigned combinations of enforcement method (automated or visual inspection) and fine levels. We measure the impact of treatment assignment on outcomes related to enforcement and compliance, water use and customer contact with the water utility. "
