abstract: "Using experimental finance methodology, we simulate financial decision making under risk in the form of investment tasks. Experimental Currency Units aim to make the situation more realistic. The ECU frame, however, is often arbitrarily chosen. In particular, when tangibility or numerosity - individuals tend to over-infer quantity when it is represented with higher numeric values - has an effect on risk decision making. Do higher ECU frames bias decision making in financial risk-taking tasks? This study aims to test whether the ECU frame - affects financial decision making under risk. Our result will refine experimental finance methodology.
