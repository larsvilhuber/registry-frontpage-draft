abstract: "Many development programs in developing countries seek to achieve lasting behavior change in gender norms among their beneficiaries through program interventions. Development programs typically provide their beneficiaries with gender trainings for some period of time, with behavior change often a core element of the programsâ€™ theories of change. As development programs in developing countries increasingly target women in order to improve outcomes for all, questions related with engaging men in the process remain unanswered: How can social stigmas held by men about their participation in household chores and childcare be addressed? Can we achieve more by post training reminders, perhaps in the form of periodical reminders reinforcing training contents, using new technologies like mobile phones? The high penetration of mobile phone adoption in the developing world attracted researchers to look for ways of using mobile phones in delivering information to target populations. We conduct a randomized control trial (RCT) in a population of rural participants in a livelihoods and gender training program, randomly assigning participants to a treatment group, which receives phone-based reinforcement of training messages related to male participation on household chores and childcare. Participants assigned to the control group receive the same number of phone calls addressing a placebo topic unrelated to the treatment. "
