abstract: "The aim of this project is to analyze the effects of providing information to parents on the quantity and quality of screen exposure in early childhood. We randomly provide evidence-based recommendations on best practices to the main caregivers of children between 0 and 5 years of age. Parental practices and beliefs regarding screen exposure are gathered through online surveys. This allow us to identify the causal effect of an information policy on parental beliefs and decisions regarding early screen exposure. Our primary outcomes are: screen time, co-viewing, content quality, screen habits, parental use of screens and a summary index of the child's media exposure (quantity and quality). Our secondary outcomes are parental beliefs on screen exposure.

The experiment takes place in Uruguay. Potential participants receive an invitation to participate in the study and a small survey to determine eligibility. If individuals are eligible, they receive the baseline survey. Those that fill-out the baseline survey are randomly assigned to treatment and control. The information treatment is provided at the end of the baseline survey. The intervention consists on a short video with information on regulation of media time and best practices during exposure based on recognised health-institutions. Moreover, a digital leaflet with personalized tips on screen exposure is provided. The expected sample size is between 1,500 and 3,000 caregivers at baseline. 

The control group is active, receiving an analogous intervention on an unrelated parenting topic: feeding practices in early childhood. We use this cross-intervention design to provide an estimate of experimenter demand effects in parenting practices.  "
