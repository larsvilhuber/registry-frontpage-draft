abstract: "Existing evaluations of text- message based reminders of court appearances have been found to substantially reduce the probability that a defendant fails to appear (FTA) in court. Reducing FTAs can potentially minimize the link between criminal conviction and persistent poverty, as FTAs for minor misdemeanors lead to arrest warrants being issued, increased fines, or even incarceration. The research team has submitted a large proposal to evaluate two potential strategies to reduce FTAs among the people charged with misdemeanors associated with homelessness.  This complementary pilot proposal is intended to replicate an existing successful text-message based reminder system, implemented in New York City, in Shasta County.  

Given the institutional and population differences across these two studies, it is not obvious that the findings of Cooke et al. (2018), which have generally been replicated in other large urban jurisdictions, will hold in smaller, rural court.  Further, the target population, people at risk of homelessness, may be less likely to receive text messages and may respond to those messages differently. Our focus on those experiencing housing instability is crucial because these individuals are the most likely to miss court and experience economic distress.

We propose to implement this pilot study over two months, with a one month follow up period, during which we will produce a short summary of the pilot results, comparing FTA rates across control and treatment groups, and for those charged with misdemeanors in general and those charged with misdemeanors related to homelessness.   These results will allow us to place the findings of our larger study in the larger context of research on reducing FTAs.
