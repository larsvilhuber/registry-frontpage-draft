abstract: "Many safety net program applications result in procedural denials due to the administrative burden associated with applying. We study the effect of an alternative application process for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) designed to alleviate barriers to program access associated with the intake interview. Using a field experiment involving over 60,000 applicants in Los Angeles County, we find that access to on-demand interviews significantly increases long-term participation rates and expedites the time to approval. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating flexibility into the design of program integrity policies to minimize procedural denials."
