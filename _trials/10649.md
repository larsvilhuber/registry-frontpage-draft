abstract: "The Luminos Liberia programme (also known as Second Chance, or SC) provides 10 months of intensive classroom instruction to out-of-school children (OOSC) to (re-)integrate students into mainstream public schools at the end of the program. The programme began in Ethiopia and expanded to Liberia in 2016 and is considered to be an accelerated learning programme, in which children learn basic literacy, numeracy and socio-emotional skills. IDinsight partnered with Luminos to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the impact of the programme on children's learning outcomes. In this impact evaluation, 50 randomly assigned communities will participate in the programme, whereas 50 comparable communities will not. 20 children per community are tested on learning and numeracy skills (using respectively EGRA and EGMA) at the beginning and end of the programme, allowing for a rigorous estimation of the impact on learning outcomes. In addition, 5 children per community are tested on socio-emotional learning outcomes. In addition to the RCT, 5 children from public schools in every community are tested, to construct a scoring benchmark."
