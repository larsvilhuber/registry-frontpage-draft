abstract: "Recent data have shown that covid19 is disproportionately infecting and killing African Americans and Latinx people in the United States. Moreover, since our last experiment, the killing of George Floyd by Minnesota police has raised awareness of structural racism in the United States.

The aim of the study is to build off results from our first experiment (AEARCTR-0005789, NCT04371419), and test whether messages that acknowledge racial injustice on behalf of institutions affect the retention of knowledge and movement of beliefs and behavior with respect to COVID-19. We  will also test the effect of concordance of providers and whether highlighting the unequal burden of the disease has additional effects on knowledge, beliefs and behavior regarding covid-19. The sample will include African American and white adult Americans and oversample those with less than a college degree. We are also interested in whether there are differential impacts of racial concordance and acknowledgments of racial injustice by the race and political views of the message's recipient."
