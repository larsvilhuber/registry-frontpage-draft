abstract: "Empirical evidence shows that people attribute good outcomes to their own merits and bad outcomes to external factors that are beyond their control. We will test how this self-serving attribution bias shapes people's beliefs about meritocracy in society and affects downstream consequences for economic actions. We hypothesize that people who experience bad outcomes form more pessimistic beliefs about the meritocracy of society and as a consequence become less motivated to work hard. In contrast, overconfident people who experience good outcomes form more optimistic beliefs about the meritocracy of society and as a consequence become more motivated to work hard."
