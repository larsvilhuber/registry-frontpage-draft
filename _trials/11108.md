abstract: "This project is the first experimental assessment of preventive patrolling in Brazil. We partnered with Parana Military Police to design and test the effects of hot spots policing on crime in Curitiba, Brazil. We identified 557 hot spot street segments and randomly assigned 211 to receive more police visits over the intervention period and will compare this treatment effect against business-as-usual patrols at hotspots. It is hypothesized that more time spent at hotspots (i.e., 30 minutes) with two or more visits per day will cause more reduction in robberies and other crimes that take place on streets.  We also use non-experimental streets to test for spillovers onto non-hot spots and examine aggregate effects citywide. This study will complement the scant literature on hotspot policing in Latin America which so far has shown limited impact. The intervention has started on March 27th 2023 and is planned to last until July 2023.
