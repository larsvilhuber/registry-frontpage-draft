abstract: "Individuals often change their decision-making in response to complexity, as has been discussed for decades in psychology and economics, but existing literature provides little evidence on the general characteristics of these processes. We introduce an experimental methodology to show that in the face of complexity, individuals resort to "procedural" decision-making, which we categorize as choice processes that are more describable. We elicit accuracy in replicating decision-makers' choices to experimentally measure and incentivize the choice process' describability. We show that procedural decision-making increases as we exogenously vary the complexity of the environment. This allows for procedural reinterpretations of existing findings in decision-making under complexity, such as in the use of heuristics."
