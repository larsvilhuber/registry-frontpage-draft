abstract: "This study examines the potential of one-on-one conversations to weaken taboos and agreeent to social restrictions surrounding menstruation. The research design involves structured conversations between school-attending teenagers and facilitators. During these brief interactions, facilitators guide participants through a questionnaire and present vignettes that may prompt reflection on societal perceptions of menstruation and to encourage participants to imagine themselves in various menstruation-related scenarios.  

To assess the impact of these conversations, we exogenously vary the placement of questions regarding participants’ agreement with menstrual health behaviors—positioning them either at the beginning or the end of the session. This experimental design allows us to isolate the causal effect of the conversation on participants’ agreement with menstrual restrictions. "
