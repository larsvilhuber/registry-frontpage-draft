abstract: "Babble is the consonant-vowel syllabic vocalisations (e.g., ‘dadada’) produced by infants typically from 7 months of age and is the precursor to spoken language. Whilst early babbling and first word production are known to be related, a causal relationship has not yet been experimentally established. This project will address this through a new intervention aimed at infants from lower-SES families. 
Such infants are at risk for slower-than-typical early word production. It is well established that children from such families have much less adult speech addressed to them than children from middle-SES families, and their language on entering nursery/reception is less advanced than that of children from middle-SES families. We suspect that the lower exposure to speech in those infants begins in their first year – low-SES-infants’ babble receives fewer adult responses contingent on their vocalisations at age 11 months than does that of middle-SES infants and they engage in fewer verbal interactions with adults and vocalise less than middle-SES infants, even though they begin babbling at a similar age. 
The intervention will be delivered using an iPad game (BabblePlay) which we have designed, that rewards infants with moving shapes appearing on the screen when they vocalise.The app responds to voiced infant utterances in real time with colourful moving shapes, providing reinforcement to all vocalisations within an infant’s pitch range that are not too loud (so as not to encourage shouting and crying). It does not respond to environmental sounds such as bangs, rustling and traffic noise.
We predict that infants who have used BabblePlay will have larger vocabularies than those who have not, and that their parents’ attitudes towards talking to infants will become more favorable as a result."
