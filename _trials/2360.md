abstract: "The objective of this project is to investigate factors associated with stated willingness to pay (WTP) among customers of two water utilities in Kenya for a sanitation surcharge to achieve safe sanitation in low income urban and peri-urban areas. We employ the double-bounded contingent valuation method to measure customer willingness to pay for improved sanitation services to nearby low-income communities.  We vary the scenarios quasi-experimentally to study the effects of messaging and surcharge administration.  We measure attitudes, demographic and housing characteristics in the survey to see how well they correlate with willingness to pay."
