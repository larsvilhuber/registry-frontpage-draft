abstract: "The test will have two phases to test changes to processes and procedures in order to determine if such they result in increased (a) registration and (b) engagement among young people (aged 18-45) in group sessions designed to increase resilience and community cohesion in Yemen. Phase 1 will test if a behaviorally informed recruitment flyer that uses a reminder, pro-social motivation, the salience of safety, scarcity, and the provision of a map result in a higher proportion of individuals coming to register for the workshop compared to a flyer without these elements. Phase 2 will test if (a) the use of an SMS reminder and a behaviorally informed registration flyer that includes a reminder and pro-social messaging increases the proportion of registered participants who subsequently attend the first session of an educational workshop; (b) sending a SMS reminder to participate in each of the 3 sessions and making a public commitment to participate in all session results in participants attending more workshop sessions; (c) making an implementation intention to follow through on the community cohesion activity they commit to during the workshop increases the proportion of individuals who subsequently present their final community initiative during the grant competition one month later.
