abstract: "This experiment studies network formation in a lab setting. Participants interact in a group, and choose an effort level and their connections to other group members. Effort and linking are costly but also bring benefits according to the linear-quadratic utility function studied in many network game applications. We study equilibrium formation and selection, and the efficiency of the experimental outcomes relative to the theoretical predictions. We vary the group size and the cost of linking across experimental treatments. "
