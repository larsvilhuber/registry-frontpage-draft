abstract: "There are structural barriers to women's economic participation and empowerment in India. Among these barriers is the lack of affordable and reliable daycare services. The responsibility of providing childcare is imposed primarily on women and contributes to gender inequalities experienced by women over the life-course. The provision of affordable and reliable daycare services is a potentially important policy lever for reducing gender inequality and improving health and socioeconomic well-being over the life-course. Access to daycare might reduce barriers to labor force entry and generate economic opportunities for women, improve education for girls caring for younger siblings, and promote nutrition and learning among children. However, empirical evidence concerning the effects of daycare programs over the life-course in low-and-middle-income countries is scarce. We propose a cluster-randomized impact evaluation for estimating the effect of a community-based daycare program on health and economic well-being over the life-course among women and children living in rural Rajasthan, India. This interdisciplinary research initiative will address an important research gap and has the potential to inform policies for improving the daycare system in India in ways that promote inclusive economic growth."
