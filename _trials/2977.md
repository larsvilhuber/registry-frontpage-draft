abstract: "The objective of the study is to assess, 4 years after a pilot safety net intervention ended in April 2014, the sustainability of the intervention's impacts on households, children, and women. The intervention, called the Transfer Modality Research Initiative (TMRI), was assigned following a cluster-randomized controlled trial design in two zones of Bangladesh (north and south). WFP-Bangladesh implemented the intervention, and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) conducted the impact evaluation research. Intervention arms were assigned at the village level, stratified by zone, where arms were as follows: (1) cash transfers [north and south]; (2) cash transfers + nutrition behavior communication change (BCC) [north only]; (3) food transfers [north and south]; (4) food transfers + nutrition BCC [south only]; (5) food-cash split [north and south]; and (6) control [north and south]. Within treatment villages, women living in very poor households were targeted to receive benefits for two years, from May 2012-April 2014. For the original impact evaluation, longitudinal data on 5000 households were collected from 2012-2015 (RCT ID: AEARCTR-0000247).

For the sustainability study in 2018, given available funding, the sampling frame will include 4000 households. This will include all households that were originally in the following arms: (1) cash transfers [north and south]; (2) cash transfers + nutrition BCC [north only]; (3) food transfers [north and south]; (4) food transfers + nutrition BCC [south only]; (5) control [north and south]."
