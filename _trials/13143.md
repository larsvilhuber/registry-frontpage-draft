abstract: "This study experimentally investigates behavior under uncertainty when subjects experience growing awareness of states. The theoretical literature on evolution of preferences in response to growing awareness has suggested that subjective beliefs evolve according to reverse Bayesianism. Our experimental design allows us to disentangle behavior across two different dimensions. One dimension is whether or not behavior is consistent with reverse Bayesianism. The other dimension is whether preferences are consistent with subjective expected utility, the more general class of biseparable preferences, or with neither. The former dimension concerns between-awareness-levels behavior, while the latter dimension concerns within-awareness-level behavior. Our experimental design allows us to test connections between the two dimensions, thereby casting light on whether and how behavioral patterns within and between distinct awareness levels are linked.
