abstract: "What is the willingness to pay for reliable electricty among rural consumers in developing countries, and how responsive is demand to changes in the price of electricity? Electrification is a major growth policy challenge for developing countries, as it requires large investments in infrastructure while consumers' and producers' willingness to pay for electricity in low income countries remains largely unknown. These challenges are exacerbated in rural areas, where potential consumers of electricity tend to be poorer and the costs of extending access to the grid higher than in urban markets. I use a randomized control trial (RCT) with customers of a pay as you go (PAYG) solar company in Rwanda and Kenya to study demand for electricity among rural consumers by randomly varying the effective price of electricity for different consumers. This experimental design allows me to estimate the price elasticity of demand for electricity and to trace out the demand curve for electricity. Because customers have a solar home system that includes a battery for storing electricity generated during daylight hours, consumers have reliable access to electricity as long as they purchase system access time. Therefore, my estimates of consumer demand will be estimates of demand for reliable access to electricity. Furthermore, consumers in my sample purchase all appliances except mobile phones from the solar provider, nearly all of which are primarily for consumption. These features of my experimental setting enable me to contribute to understanding demand for reliable electricity for consumption among rural consumers. 

In addition to providing evidence on the nature of demand for electricity among rural consumers, I will contribute to the growing body of evidence on the benefits of rural electrification. Measuring the benefits of electricity for consumption is particularly challenging, as it requires valuing difficult to measure benefits like increased leisure time, long-term improvements in health outcomes, improvements in educational outcomes, and enhanced feelings of safety and security (CGAP 2017). Rather than attempting to directly value such benefits, I take a novel approach by applying the techniques developed in Ligon (2016) to measure households' marginal utility of expenditure. I plan to supplement this with a structural estimate of welfare.
