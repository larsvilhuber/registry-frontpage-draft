abstract: "Recruiting and retaining talented employees is important for organizational success. Scholars have examined various individual factors (e.g., demographic characteristics, employee work attitudes, employee motivation) and organizational factors (e.g., human resource management practices, job characteristics, work environment) that affect (i) incumbent employees’ retention and turnover intentions and (ii) prospective employees’ likelihood of applying for and accepting certain jobs. However, most of these studies have focused on careers in the private sector, which are not often impacted by perceptions of public support or scrutiny. In this study, we examine the impact that perceptions of public support and scrutiny have on one’s willingness to pursue or continue a career as a law enforcement officer. Public support for law enforcement is a highly polarized topic in the United States, making this the ideal setting to determine whether the public’s perception of a group of workers impacts the recruitment and retention of those individuals."
