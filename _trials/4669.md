abstract: "We investigate the effectiveness of documentary films to change individual attitudes justifying domestic violence, and reporting of own experiences of domestic violence. We study this in Tanzania, where the Tanzanian Ministry of Community Development, Gender and Children produced a documentary film showing severe cases of violence against women, albinos and children, in 2009. We use fragments of this documentary as experimental treatments with the intention to evaluate the effectiveness of documentary video material to affect individual attitudes about domestic violence, and reporting of own experiences of domestic violence. In particular, we compare these two outcomes among participants who watched a video on violence against women, with those of participants who watched a video on violence against albinos (control group 1) and participants who did not watch any video (control group 2). The intervention is implemented separately among women and men to assess the effectiveness of the video across genders. Findings from this study can enhance the current understanding of whether and how documentary video material can help public policy in changing harmful individual attitudes and social norms."
