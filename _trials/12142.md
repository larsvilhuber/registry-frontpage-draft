abstract: "We study the effects of a psychological self-affirmation intervention on performance in a real-effort task. The study is motivated by a previously conducted field experiment among a poor and stigmatized group in Namibia, in which a standard self-affirmation intervention (recalling successful experiences) backfired by reducing productivity. In an online experiment, we study whether this backfiring can be explained by a failure to adequately respond to the self-affirmation prompt. Subjects may either fail to adequately respond when they have difficulty recalling successful experiences (“ease-of-retrieval”) or when subjects do not fill the time allocated to talk about positive experiences."
