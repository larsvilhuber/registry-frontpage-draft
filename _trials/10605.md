abstract: "Despite the high societal costs generated by conflict between social identity groups, we still have little clarity of what the micro-foundations of these conflicts are. Understanding and disentangling the deep drivers of conflict is important because they determine which policies are effective. In this paper, I first ask to what extent is intergroup conflict driven by hate vs fear. To answer this, I use a lab-in-the-field to estimates preferences and beliefs, and understand to what extent each one prevents cooperation between groups. Then, I ask how popular local policies tackle these two channels to increase cooperation. To answer this, I evaluate the effects of radio drama with a message to increase intergroup cooperation, and estimate how the treatment changes the parameters I estimate in the lab, and other real behavior outcomes."
