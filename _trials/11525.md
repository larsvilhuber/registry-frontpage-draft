abstract: "The primary objective of our study is to empirically examine the effectiveness of a video message addressing environmental concerns. The narratives in the video aim to motivate viewers to modify their behaviors and contribute to averting a significant environmental catastrophe. Our focus lies in evaluating the impact of two key factors: the content of the message and the person delivering it. We specifically intend to investigate how these factors influence public awareness, changes in beliefs and attitudes, and support for policies related to the potential submergence of a mega city in a developing nation. To achieve this, we will manipulate the content and presenter along two dimensions: religion and science. In terms of content, we will augment the standard environmental damage message with both religious and scientific narratives. Regarding the presenter, we will enlist the services of an actor who will portray two distinct roles: an academic/researcher and a Muslim religious leader or imam. To establish a baseline for comparison, we will also include a control group that will view a placebo video without a presenter. The study seeks to shed light on the most effective strategies for delivering environmental messages, thereby promoting public engagement and encouraging behavioral change among individuals."
