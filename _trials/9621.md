abstract: "Service provision by governments is often delayed in developing countries. On one hand, the government's capacity is constrained by lack of resources. On the other hand, it is often argued that government officers do not perform optimally with given resources. To address these issues, the state government in India.  The existing Act mandates bureaucratic officials to deliver the services within a specified duration, a violation of which can incur a penalty. Using a randomized controlled trial, we evaluate an intervention where the time provided by the pre-existing Act to government officials to deliver citizen services is shortened.  We measure officials' performance using administrative data and citizen surveys."
