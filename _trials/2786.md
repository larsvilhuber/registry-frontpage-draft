abstract: "The research seeks to assess the impact of a program targeted to increase the take-up of local social services with a particular focus on employment amongst disadvantaged families in the Belgian city of Kortrijk. The study is designed as a RCT which will enable us to test whether close counseling by multi-disciplinary case handlers leads to increased take-up rates of social services (and to some extent benefits). The effectiveness is tested by randomization of poor households into two groups: an intervention group and a control group. Approximately 235 participants will be equally divided between control and treatment. In addition to testing a strategy to reduce non-take-up of social services and benefits, the research aims to understand the underlying mechanism of non-take-up (NTU) and examine other possible outcomes of the intervention. Therefore the RCT is complemented by a mixed method approach where participants in the experiment are surveyed to shed light on determinants of NTU and examine as well outcomes including well-being, social network, trust in institutions, satisfaction with social services as well as living conditions. The hypothesis is that the integrated delivery of social services through multidisciplinary case handlers leads to better employment outcomes for service users. More precisely, it is assumed that pro-active action will improve the take-up of employment support, income support and other social services provided directly to the person and that the outcome and sustainability of employment support will improve when effective action is taken in several domains of life, delivered in an integrated manner through single points of contact. The study and program are funded under the umbrella of the EASI (Employment and Social Innovation) programme (PROGRESS axis) of the European Commission. "
