abstract: "Policymakers often choose between price-based and regulatory policies to achieve the same policy objective. This study explores preferences for price-based versus regulatory measures in the contexts of sugar-sweetened soft drinks and car traffic in city centers. To elicit preferences, we employ a multiple price list format, which enables us to evaluate the impact of the price of the price-based measure on policy preferences. We also use information treatments to experimentally vary perceptions of the price-based measure's effectiveness and fairness. In addition, we gather beliefs about the characteristics of each policy and measure moral convictions in the form of inclinations toward utilitarianism as well as trait reactance."
