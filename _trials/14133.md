abstract: "In surveys, social desirability bias can impact how respondents answer questions. We intend to survey people to ask their responses to hypothetical scenarios where we randomize language about the scenario in which they are answering the question. We will use their responses to understand how different language and prompts about the situation in which they are responding to the questions may (or may not) change how they people answer questions."
