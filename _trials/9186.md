abstract: "Inequality is often inherited: individuals are not involved in the process that generates inequality, yet end up with different amounts of resources or opportunities based solely on relations to other people. We have previously conducted an online survey experiment with
a broadly representative sample of the US population to study individuals' redistributive preferences in situations featuring inherited inequality. This first study has been preregistered at the AEA RCT Registry (RCT ID: AEARCTR-0007948) and can be accessed here: https://doi.org/10.1257/rct.7948-1.5000000000000004. We now plan to conduct a second replication study which includes some methodological improvements.
Details presented in the pre-analysis plan."
