abstract: "This study evaluates the impacts of three different active labour market policies for unemployed youth in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We look at the impacts of the following interventions: i) a transport subsidy to lower the costs of searching for employment in the centre of the city, ii) a screening intervention where individuals are given a range of personnel tests and issued with certificates reporting their outcomes for these test (this intervention is given with training on how these certificates can be used to apply for jobs), and iii) a job fairs intervention, where individuals are invited to attend an event where they can interact with a number of large firms looking looking for recruits. The project also seeks to estimate the spillover effects from treated individuals to untreated individuals in neighborhoods where a randomly varying proportion of unemployed individuals are given the treatments.
