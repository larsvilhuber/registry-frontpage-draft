abstract: "The number of displaced people globally has reached a historic high, posing significant challenges in addressing the needs of the affected groups. Displaced people often face numerous hardships including a lack of economic opportunities, vulnerability to shocks, and poverty. Additionally, they are particularly vulnerable to psychological distress due to traumatic experiences, challenging camp or transit situations, loss of family members, and uncertainty, while their access to mental health services is low. In this study, we examine the interaction between the economic and psychological wellbeing of refugees in Kenya and evaluate how both dimensions are impacted by a program bundle, including (1) a cash transfer and (2) a psychoeducation program and financial literacy training.

We implement our study in the Kakuma Refugee Camp and the Kalobeyei Settlement in Turkana County, Northern Kenya, which host about 283,000 refugees, predominately from South Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo."
