abstract: "Yemen is one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises where around 21.6 million people require some form of assistance, and 2.25 million children are estimated to suffer from acute malnutrition. The conditions are expected to deteriorate due to the country’s damaged food systems, local infrastructure, economy, and reliance on seasonal rainfall and groundwater resources for agricultural production. The disruptions caused by the ongoing civil war, a great increase in food commodities prices caused by the Ukraine war, coupled with high prices of and unreliable access to diesel for pumping well water, pose a great risk to country’s food security. This project aims to evaluate the impact of implementing solar-powered water pumps and water-conserving irrigation system on water accessibility, water consumption, irrigation costs, productivity, and livelihoods. We estimate these effects by employing a clustered randomized control trial in Yemen, with one control group and one treatment group in addition to assessing potential spillover impacts."
