abstract: "Theoretical models suggest that observability, along with its downstream consequences, is a key parameter shaping individuals’ pro-social behavior. However, empirical findings reveal mixed effects, prompting questions about when and why individual pro-social behavior is sensitive to observability. To address these questions, we will conduct an incentivized between-subject online experiment aimed at untangling possible relevant mechanisms that drive the impact of observability on pro-social behavior. Specifically, we will examine two key factors: the level of observability and observer’s feedback on the decision. In a dictator game with an observer, we will explore how the level of observability (knowing there will be an observer; exchanging photos; seeing each other in a video call) and observer’s feedback on the decision (like/dislike) influence individuals’ pro-sociality."
