abstract: "This paper describes a series of school-based field experiments in over 200 urban schools across three cities designed to better understand the impact of financial incentives on student achievement. In Dallas, students were paid to read books. In New York, students were rewarded for performance on interim assessments. In Chicago, students were paid for classroom grades. Researchers estimate that the impact of financial incentives on state test scores is statistically zero, in each city. Due to a lack of power, however, researchers cannot rule out the possibility of effect sizes that would have positive returns on investment. The only statistically significant effect is on English speaking students in Dallas. The paper concludes with a speculative discussion of what might account for inter-city differences in estimated treatment effects."
