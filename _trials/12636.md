abstract: "The aim of the trial is to investigate how a well designed pre-school program can improve child development and school readiness, while at the same time improving female empowerment through improved employment and earnings and better recognition of their roles as mothers.
Currently preschools in Tharaka Nithi County, Kenya only admit children from 4 years old. And while there is a curriculum for their education schools tend to be under-equipped with learning materials.

The intervention consists of six main components: A. Expanding admission to 3-year-olds in the current preschools (they currently start at 4), B. Preparing a curriculum to accommodate the 3-year old children (as the curriculum currently starts at 4 years) and improving the teaching practices in the center for all children, including the 4 year olds, C. Developing teacher activity guides to support curriculum implementation, D. Providing developmentally appropriate teaching and learning materials (e.g. picture books, puzzles, games), E. Adding an extra teacher in the preschool class (PP1), and F. Training the teachers in the implementation of the curriculum through teacher-training workshops and in-class coaching.

The study targets are women's; labor supply, earnings and empowerment; and the cognitive development and school readiness of the 3- and 4-year-old children.
