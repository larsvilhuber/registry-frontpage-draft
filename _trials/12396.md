abstract: "Can mentorship programs improve women's job search and early career outcomes? We will run a randomized controlled trial to evaluate an online one-to-one mentorship program targeted at female college students and early career women, with the majority being from socially vulnerable groups. We hypothesize that structured one-to-one mentoring programs increase self-confidence, networks, and job search readiness and, consequently, improve labor market outcomes of college-educated women, particularly from socially disadvantaged backgrounds."
