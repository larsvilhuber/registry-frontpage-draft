abstract: "We conduct an experiment to investigate how task autonomy affects intrinsic motivation. In the experiment, we study how autonomy affects performance directly through the opportunity to actively select a task in itself, as well as indirectly through the selection of a suitable task. Therefore, we investigate two complementing effects of task autonomy: an indirect (selection into tasks) and a direct effect (intrinsic motivation). "
