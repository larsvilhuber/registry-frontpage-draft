abstract: "India has an extensive network of Primary Health Centers that provide essential medical care to the very poor.  However, despite the large budgetary allocations made to the public health care system, the quality of care remains low, as do health outcomes.   One key reason for this is the high level of absenteeism amount the medical staff (see Duflo, Hanna, and Ryan, 2010 for a discussion of absenteeism among government workers in India).

The State of Government of Karnataka (GoK), India, proposes to tackle this issue through the use of technology via a pilot project in five districts of the state. In the pilot, the Multi Function Devices (MFDs) will be used to (a) digitally capture the thumb impressions of health staff to monitor attendance, (b) capture beneficiary photograph and signature electronically to ensure only the genuine patients receive the benefits, and (c) transmit information on local disease and health patterns in real time to state health authorities to enable effective response to emerging local health threats. This technology will be coupled with a system of incentives to encourage improvements in staff attendance, reduce leakages, and ensure prompt action on emerging local health threats. 
The government has asked for a randomized evaluation of the study.   322 PHCs will be in the study.  The government will run their intervention as they normally would, in roughly half of the PHCs (140).  They will pay for the costs of the intervention.

The evaluation design, data collection effort and analysis is led by JPAL researchers."
