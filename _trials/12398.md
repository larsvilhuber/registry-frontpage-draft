abstract: "Irrigation allows farmers to adapt to heat stress or droughts. However, the threat of groundwater depletion and uneven access to irrigation make it an incomplete adaptation response. This project assesses how public goods, like water reservoirs that enhance widespread irrigation access through collecting and storing rainwater, can facilitate climate adaptation. We test the effectiveness of such tanks by studying the constraints they face from farmers' irrigation responses and other input markets like water and labor. 

In the Bundelkhand region of central India, traditional tanks were constructed centuries ago to store rainwater for irrigation during the next dry season. The tanks have accumulated silt over time reducing their capacity and ability to source water in the dry season. Our intervention will deepen these tanks to improve their volume and facilitate underground drainage of harvested water. Farmers can access this water directly from the tank through pumps or increased water levels in their wells. This intervention could either equip farmers with the necessary irrigation to improve their productivity and mitigate the negative effects of climate shocks, or, it could lead farmers to undo the positive effects of the tank by disproportionately increasing water extraction as a response to the increased water supply. The effects of the tank may also be susceptible to "elite capture" through large farmers using costly equipment to monopolize the resource in the local water market. Therefore, we also evaluate how an individually targeted intervention like training on conservative and climate-robust agriculture affects the resilience, productivity, and efficiency of groundwater use. Our design tests the extent to which the training can substitute or complement the tank renovation intervention. Last, we will measure how the tank affects labor supply and demand on the farms and whether this is likely to moderate the effects of the intervention on climate adaptation.
