abstract: "We analyze the supply curve (willingness-to-accept, WTA) using BDM alongside real opportunities for blood donation. We investigate how information about peer blood donation behavior affects supply and whether a respondent's own blood donation aligning (or not) with their identity group peers influences their identification with that group. We assess the persistence of such identity shifts, employing various identification measures, including two incentivized ones. Additionally, we explore how the perceived scarcity of one's blood impacts WTA as a secondary inquiry."
