abstract: "The majority of refugees globally have limited access to local labor markets due to legal restrictions and high unemployment in many of the low and middle-income countries hosting them.  In this project, we investigate the promise of randomized remote work training and professional mentorship in increasing access to online work opportunities for refugees, often economically and geographically marginalized. The interventions aim to lift informational, logistical, behavioral, and cultural barriers to remote work adoption and success. First stage outcomes of interest include take-up and participation in the training and mentorship sessions, knowledge and skills, activity on online work platforms, and human capital investments. Second stage outcomes of interest include  employment online and offline, social integration, migration decisions and intentions, and mental health.
