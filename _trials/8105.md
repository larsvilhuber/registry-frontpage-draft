abstract: "The COVID-19 pandemic is a challenge to all global communities. To overcome it, successful cooperation is critical. At the same time, essential resources such as safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19 and intensive care units in hospitals are scarce resources. For a nation to survive, such scarce resources should be available to all residents, including foreigners. However, the competition of individuals for scarce resources might lead to deepened social divides. Whether a nation can distribute scarce resources in a manner considered optimal for society as a whole, overcoming the conflicts of individual interests, would be an informative measure of that nation's inclusiveness, an ability that affects its survival.

Our experiment is set amid the natural experimental environment of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. Japan's capacity for vaccine production is still tightly limited as emergent variants of COVID-19 might necessitate three or more doses of a vaccine. We investigate whether respondents want to allocate COVID-19 vaccines equally among residents of Japanese and foreigners with the same background characteristics, in accord with standards that the government has applied.

We employ a randomized conjoint design. Respondents are shown three hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine recipients, each with different background characteristics, including nationality and residency status. We then asked the respondents to place three potential recipients in order of priority allocation. We observe a marginal change in the preferred allocation of vaccines when nationality and/or residency status is changed. "
