abstract: "DDU-GKY is a large-scale training programme in India. It is targeted at the rural poor youth, and combines short-term training with guaranteed job placement. Dropout during training and the lack of retention in placement jobs are the main problems faced by the programme. Based on evidence gathered in a previous project, we hypothesise that an important determinant of dropout is misinformation of trainees about the programme and placement jobs. We design an information intervention that takes the form of two information sessions, one before the training starts and the second before trainees are placed with employers for on-the-job training. We randomise these interventions across 90 training batches in Bihar and Jharkhand. We intend to use administrative and survey data to analyse the effects of these interventions on training completion, job uptake and retention, as well as other outcomes describing the labour-market and socio-economic situation of trainees.
