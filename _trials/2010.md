abstract: "There has been a recent research growth in the intersection between health and behavioral economics. Some of this research has looked into the importance of the framing of the information delivered. Most of this work has focused on emphasizing the positive or negative effects of specific behaviors (e.g. quit smoking, improve diet, take a specific treatment, etc.). In this trial we will test framing in a different sense: encouraging beneficiaries to increase their effort without referring to the benefits or detriments of not following a specific action. As part of a government pilot program called Prospera Digital, pregnant women and mothers with babies less than two years old receive personalized SMS with healthcare information. Our trial consists on making a small variation to the pilot program with the objective of measuring the influence of motivational and socio-emotional content (MSE content) on womenâ€™s behavior and their babies health outcomes. Two sets of messages have been designed: (i) the first set of messages, the control arm, removes most MSE content possible from the government trial program without affecting the knowledge that the messages intend to transmit; (ii) the second set, the treatment arm, exacerbates the MSE content without adding healthcare information.
