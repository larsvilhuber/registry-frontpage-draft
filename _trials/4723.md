abstract: "Data sharing has become more widespread, in part due to progressive policies by biomedical journals that promote its availability. Yet despite programs intended to enforce sharing upon request, scientists may not make their data available for many reasons, including concerns about sufficient time and lack of funding. While there is some evidence that the recipients organization may have an impact on data availability, current data sharing policies do not make distinctions between private and public funding of research by the recipient. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to determine whether perceptions of the funding source of the recipient will impact the willingness and ability to share data by scientists conducting and publishing secondary research (i.e., evidence synthesis)."
