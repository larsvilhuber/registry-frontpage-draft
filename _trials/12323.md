abstract: "Using a large-scale survey experiment of German households, this study examines how transparency related to costs and future cost projections influences the choice of heating technologies among private households. Employing a Multiple Price List, participants repeatedly choose between a replacement of their current fossil heating system and a heat pump at incrementally decreasing prices. This enables us to estimate the price premium that households are willing to pay (or the price advantage required) to switch from a fossil fuel heating system to a heat pump, along with the subsidy necessary to encourage households to choose a heat pump."
