abstract: "I evaluate a randomized controlled trial of high-touch financial counseling sessions provided by a non-profit financial wellness organization. Counseling sessions consist of thirty- to sixty-minute phone calls, in which counselors help individuals prioritize their debts and construct a detailed budget. Drawing from a sample of highly-distressed student loan borrowers, I measure the impact of these counseling sessions on a variety of financial health outcomes, including credit scores, bankruptcies, credit card balances, and student loan delinquencies."
