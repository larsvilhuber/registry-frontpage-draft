abstract: "Eight years after the 2008 economic crisis, high unemployment rates among youths combined with school dropout rates significantly above the European average have left Spain with an important population of undereducated youth who are neither working, nor in education or training (NEETs). Concretely, NEETs without higher secondary education represent 7.9% of Barcelona's total population aged 16 to 24. Reconsidering their decision towards post-obligatory education, and increasing their academic training, could improve labor market prospects for these youth group. A randomly selected subset of NEETs with lower secondary education certificates were offered a 9 months professional training on the Mobile sector with the objective of bringing them back to education and labor. Fifteen months after the finalization of the program, youths who were randomly selected to participate in the training were more likely to have a permanent contract and to have a job which better fitted their education level. Although no significant impacts were found in terms of general labor market participation, the point estimates were always positive and showing a clear positive trend, indicating that effects could come in the longer term. Finally, no impacts were found on enrollment rates in higher education programs. Dropout rates before completion for the training program were significantly high."
