abstract: "The question of whether wearing face masks in public is an effective measure in slowing the spread of COVID-19 is subject of current public discussion. To add to this debate, we conduct a field experiment investigating whether face masks affect how individuals comply with public health recommendations such as keeping a physical distance of 150 cm. Using two treatments (with and without mask), experimenters wait in lines to enter businesses to measure the distance kept by the person next in line. We test whether wearing a face mask impacts the distance kept by others."
