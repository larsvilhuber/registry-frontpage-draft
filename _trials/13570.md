abstract: "We study how people change their behavior after being made aware of bias. Teachers in Italian schools give lower grades to immigrant students relative to natives of comparable ability. In an online experiment implemented in 2021 as follow-up from Alesina et at (2018), we randomize teachers to either an active control group (generic debasing message) or an IAT disclosure. We find that IAT disclosure and generic debiasing have similar average effects, but there is heterogeneity: teachers with stronger negative stereotypes do not respond to generic debiasing, but change their behavior when informed about their own IAT.
