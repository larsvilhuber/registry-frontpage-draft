abstract: "Despite the rapid expansion of mobile coverage in the developing world, roughly 10% of the world's population still lives beyond the reach of a cell tower and all of the platforms, products, and services that cell towers make possible. This study investigates the impact of a new type of cellular connectivity designed specifically to address the "last mile" problem: the Community Cellular Network. Built on open-source technology, the Community Cellular Network provides community-owned cellular infrastructure at one-tenth of the cost of traditional mobile towers.
Our goal is to develop a deeper understanding of the social and economic impacts of first-time access to a cellular network in isolated communities in the Philippines. We use a two-stage randomized control trial in which we (i) randomly assign villages to receive or not receive a new cell tower; and (ii) within treated villages, randomize the price that households paid to access these networks. This pre-analysis plan describes how we plan to study the impacts of cellular access on social network structure, and several social and economic outcomes."
