abstract: "Our study evaluates the impact of the peace building educational programme in public schools in three southern regions in Kyrgyzstan: Osh, Batken and Jalalabad. The programme is aimed to encourage inter-ethnic, religious and racial understanding, leadership and conflict resolution skills among youths in societies prone to conflict. Participants are expected to gain the skills and shift in perspectives needed to break cycles of intolerance and violence and to transit from a culture of conflict to a culture of participation. This study evaluates the impact of a pilot program and aims to determine whether the program effects (a) sustain in the short to medium term (i.e.12 months after the program ends); (b) spill over to untreated peers (or family members); and (c) have the potential to be scaled up to a (sub) national level."
