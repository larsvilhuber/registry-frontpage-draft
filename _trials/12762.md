abstract: "The participation in individual shareholder voting for corporate governance proposals among publicly listed firms in China is notably low. This project aims to conduct a field experiment by providing governance knowledge and information about voting events to individual investors, assessing whether the treated firms experience an increase in shareholder voting participation and governance changes in the post-experiment period."
