abstract: "This study estimates the impact of three summer outreach programs for rising high school seniors. The programs are hosted annually by a selective private university that graduates a majority of its students in a science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM) field. The study randomly assigned program applicants between 2014 and 2016 to a control group or one of three summer programs: a six-week, residential program, a one-week residential program, and a program that takes place online over six months. The population targeted by the program is high-achieving but faces one or more potential barriers to accessing selective universities or STEM fields, such as being a first-generation college student, low-income, an underrepresented minority, or from a rural high school, for example. The outcomes studied include college application, admission, and enrollment, and student majors. Outcome data is taken from surveys, the National Student Clearinghouse, and administrative records from 36 selective private universities."
