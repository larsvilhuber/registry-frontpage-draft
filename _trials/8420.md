abstract: "This project will test whether access to a gaming pedagogical app can improve the teamwork and leadership abilities of young unemployed workers in Peru. Participants will be randomly assigned to three treatment arms: (i) access to the gaming app, (ii) access to the app plus an instructional component on social skills, and (iii) access to the app and the opportunity of leading their teams. We will use a virtual platform we have developed to measure social skills based on previous studies to measure the primary outcomes. We will also correlate these measurements with labor market outcomes and estimate treatment effects on employment and wages.
