abstract: "This study will conduct an online experiment to examine how much Americans may be willing to pay for improved equity in health outcomes.  Participants will receive a description of a hypothetical Alzheimer's disease treatment that reduces disease progression, but is not covered by insurance, and ask respondents whether they would (hypothetically) be willing to pay various amounts to make it available for everyone using unfolding valuation brackets.  We will present the choice using three different frames, randomized across participants: (1) a neutral frame, and frames highlighting Alzheimer's disease's disproportionate effects on (2) individuals with low socioeconomic status, and (3) persons of color.  Comparing valuations across groups will provide an estimate of the incremental valuation of the equity-enhancing properties of the treatment and capture whether the valuation differs if inequality is framed in economic or racial/ethnic terms.
