abstract: "Psychosocial stimulation delivered to poor, disadvantaged children and their mothers through home visits, has been shown to have large and sustained impacts on child development and later outcomes in life. This existing evidence comes mainly from small efficacy trials and a limited number of efforts to implement this type of intervention at a pilot scale. The current research project aims at understanding what magnitude of impacts can be obtained when an intervention that delivers psychosocial stimulation services through home visits to children 0-3 years of age in poor rural districts of Peru is rolled-out and implemented at large scale as a national program. 

The Programa Nacional Cuna Más (Cuna Más) was created in Peru in 2012. One of its two services, Servicio de Acompañamiento a Familias (SAF), was designed based on the successful and well-evaluated Jamaica parenting intervention. In two years, it was scaled-up to reach 60 thousand children.

Our aim is to understand the effects of this intervention on child development, on parenting practices, and on the quality of the home environment (play materials and play activities). We also aim at understanding the extent to which heterogeneity in the magnitude of such effects is associated to the quality of the home visits being delivered. Our research used the gradual roll-out of SAF to implement a randomized-control trial in 180 districts (municipalities) throughout 12 departments in Peru. The results of this study will inform on the magnitude of the impact of a psychosocial stimulation delivered at scale through home visits. They will also be informative of key elements of home visiting quality that are most associated to that impact and that need to be consolidated when taking this type of intervention to scale.
