abstract: "Impact evidence of technologies constitute a strong foundation for transparency as well as accountability in agricultural research. The robust evidence generated by impact evaluation studies serve as a basis for higher level of innovation, extension and technology promotion. This context, in fact forms the rationale for the present experimental research and the project is proposed with the aim of promotion and impact evaluation of ICAR-Indian Institute of Wheat and Barley Research (ICAR-IIWBR) released wheat variety (DBW 222) at the farmersâ€™ field."
