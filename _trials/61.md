abstract: "The Ultra Poor Graduation Pilot in Peru is a part of the CGAP/Ford Foundation global initiative, currently being implemented in eight countries, that combines safety net programs with entrepreneurial activities to develop a graduation model for the poorest households. In 2009, we conducted a baseline survey for 2,400 ultra-poor households in the Canas and Acomayo provinces in the Department of Cusco, Peru. Eight hundred households were randomly selected in 40 treatment communities (on average 20 households per community) to receive the intervention. The treatment households received an intensive support package including: livelihood trainings, productive asset transfer, consumption support, healthcare, and financial services. By investing in this multifaceted approach, the program strives to eliminate the need for long-term safety net services. Two follow-up surveys are conducted in July-September 2013 and July-September 2014."
