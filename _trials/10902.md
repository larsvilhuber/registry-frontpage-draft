abstract: "While many developing economies have made progress in providing access to education, the provision of quality education that delivers life-long learning, learning-how-to-learn, and developing the ability to apply knowledge to unfamiliar circumstances is essentially absent. In collaboration with the Agastya foundation, we conduct a randomized controlled trial in public schools in Uttar Pradesh (UP) to evaluate an intervention that provides alternative science-based pedagogy -- described as discovery-based pedagogy -- in 68 "treatment" schools which are then compared to 64 "control" schools. We aim to evaluate the impact of the intervention on students' life-long learning skills which are transferable and that go beyond academic success. Transferable skills are not taught using a textbook but have to be developed through the teaching and learning experience, which is the focus of this alternative pedagogy and we investigate whether the intervention resulted in improvement in students' overall creativity, curiosity, confidence, commitment and content-based learning but also in terms of scientific skills.
