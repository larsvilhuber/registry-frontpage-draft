abstract: "The consumer bankruptcy system provides significant benefits to high-debt individuals, yet fewer than 1% of US adults file each year. We use a randomized experiment to identify which factors are important deterrents to obtaining debt relief through bankruptcy. We will survey high-debt individuals. We will elicit perceptions of facts about bankruptcy and provide randomized information about bankruptcy to correct misperceptions. By exogenously shifting beliefs about bankruptcy, we will estimate the effect of the information provided on participantsâ€™: (i) willingness to consider bankruptcy and (ii) willingness to pay for bankruptcy information."
