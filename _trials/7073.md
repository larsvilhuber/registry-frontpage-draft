abstract: "This study presents new evidence on the gendered effects of social safety net programs, in the context of the Nigeria National Social Safety Nets Project (NASSP). The program has three components: 1) a basic unconditional cash transfer, 2) a top-up conditional cash transfer with behavioral change training, and 3) a livelihood support component comprising life skills and business skills training complemented by a lump sum productive grant. This study will evaluate the relative impacts of receiving Package 1 (component 1 alone), Package 2 (components 1 and 2), or Package 3 (components 1, 2, and 3). This evaluation will provide new evidence on scalable strategies to implement targeted government-led cash transfers and sustainable support for graduation out of poverty. It will especially further our understanding of the impacts of livelihoods interventions on intrahousehold gender dynamics and womenâ€™s economic empowerment and wellbeing."
