abstract: "This study looks at the hireability of people age 35-75 with Hispanic and non-Hispanic first and last names using resumes for a clerical position and hiring manager and administrative assistant professionals from mTurk.  We surveyed 125 participants before the COVID pandemic, 275 during the start of the COVID pandemic, but before shutdowns, and plan to survey 400 several months into the pandemic and shut-downs/reopening.  We will compare age discrimination before and after the pandemic.  We expect to see increased age discrimination because of the increased danger with age of COVID and because of stereotypes about technology use and age.  We will compare discrimination against Hispanics before and after the shutdown, and do not have a prior about the sign.  We will test different hypotheses about why discrimination could change during the pandemic.  We will test that technology has become more important by determining if job histories and training that emphasize technology are more beneficial in the post-period.  We ask questions in the pre- and post- period about how much supervision each applicant would need and expect that needing less supervision will become more important in the post-period.  We provide information about PTA volunteerism in the pre- and post- period and predict that this signal will become more negative (less positive) in the post-period.  We hypothesize that having a nice address could become more or less important-- on the one hand with remote work commuting time is less important, but on the other hand, having an indicator of reliable internet access could make it more important.  We predict that a recent work gap will be less important as many high-quality workers are being laid off."
