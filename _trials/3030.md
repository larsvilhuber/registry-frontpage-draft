abstract: "Bayesian Updating is the dominant theory of learning in economics and other disciplines. According to this theory, decision-makers have prior beliefs which they update according to Bayes rule after receiving new information. The theory is silent about how individuals react to receiving information that the subjects have not observed previously and, hence, which they may deem impossible. Recent theoretical literature has put forth a possible mechanism, called “reverse Bayesianism”, which decision-makers may use to react to unforeseen events. However, these and other possible mechanisms have not been experimentally tested. The project will fill this large gap in the literature by running a series of economic experiments. First, the experimental subjects will be asked to virtually and repeatedly draw balls from an urn. This will allow them to form beliefs about the proportion of different prizes in the urn. Subsequently, they will repeatedly bet on various prizes drawn from the urn. The subjects’ beliefs about the composition of the urn will also be elicited. The composition of the urn will be changed midpoint during this sequence (by adding a new prize that wasn’t originally present in the urn) so that the experimental subjects subsequently observe events that couldn’t be predicted given their prior information. We will explore how this will change their betting behaviour and their beliefs about the composition of the urn. We will also address the following questions. Do individuals naturally expect events that were previously considered impossible? Do individuals learn to expect what is previously considered impossible? Do individuals attach a positive or negative value to the consequences of such events?
