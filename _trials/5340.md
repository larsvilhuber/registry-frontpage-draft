abstract: "We design a lab-in-the-field experiment to understand farmers’ information-seeking behavior by taking Ethiopia as a case study. Specifically, we aim to understand the role of overconfidence and trust in farmers’ information-seeking behavior. The study will thus contribute to a deeper understanding of the low uptake of agricultural technologies among farmers in sub-Saharan Africa.
