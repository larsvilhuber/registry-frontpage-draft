abstract: "This study emphasizes the role of generative AI in modifying the descriptions of innovative solutions and how these modifications influence evaluation outcomes of humans and of AI. Specifically, the research explores how summarization, which condenses solutions into more essential and streamlined versions, and targeted reframing, which changes the writing style and wording for desired purposes, affects human evaluators' perceptions of novelty, feasibility, and other evaluation metrics.
The study's inquiry revolves around AI's ability to reframe ideas by either enhancing or neutralizing the novelty presented in these descriptions. By creating AI-modified summaries, the experiment tests whether these modifications change evaluators' views on the novelty and feasibility of early-stage ideas. The AI-neutralized descriptions allow the team to control for cognitive biases that may arise due to detailed or promotional language. Thus, the study will also investigate differences between human and AI evaluation depending on the summarization and framing. 

Key points of consideration include:
Summarization and Cognitive Load: Simplified AI-generated summaries reduce the cognitive burden on evaluators, potentially leading to less biased and more objective assessments.
Neutralization vs. Promotional Framing: The study compares the effects of AI-neutralized descriptions, where promotional language is stripped, versus AI-enhanced versions that promote novelty. It investigates whether these framings impact novelty perception and decision-making differently.
Perceived vs. Objective Novelty: AI-modified descriptions allow a direct comparison between human-perceived novelty, AI-perceived novelty (prompted GPT model), and objective novelty measures (similarity embedding techniques). The research questions whether AI summarization can bridge the gap between these dimensions.

This study thus aims to shed light on how AI-driven text modifications can influence innovation evaluation, providing insights into the role of linguistic framing and summarization in decision-making processes."
