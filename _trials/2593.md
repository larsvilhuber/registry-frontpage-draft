abstract: "This project explores the effect of a governance training and uniform distribution program on governance by Village Development Councils (VDC) in rural Malawi.  The project leverages a randomized control design to evaluate to interventions, a governance training and a uniform distribution program to committee members,  to understand how the two treatments affect a) general governance outcomes b) VDC members' efficacy and job performance, and c) villagers' perceptions of VDC members. Working in partnership with Catholic Relief Services, the PIs will conduct a baseline survey in all Group Village Heads (administrative unit for GVHs)  and then an endline in communities, which have received treatment 1 (governance training), treatment 2 (governance training and uniform distribution), and control villages (no training or distribution in the period of study).  The project conducts surveys with villagers, VDC members, other committee members, and GVH heads to evaluate the outcome variables of interest. In addition, we will conduct functionality assessments on the performance of VDCs. "
