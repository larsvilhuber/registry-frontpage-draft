abstract: "Training and professionalization interventions are an important vehicle for economic support within the development assistance landscape. Yet rigorous quantitative impact evaluations of such programs remain scarce, especially in developing countries. In order to help fill this research gap, we will conduct a rigorous impact evaluation of a program for the Professionalization of Artisans (ProfArts) in Ghana. The program will deliver top-up training, licensing, certification, and related benefits to up to 10,000 artisans drawn from the Ghanaian construction sector, with beneficiaries to be randomly selected from up to 20,000 baseline respondents. In a first step, we examine the effects of randomly assigned recruitment content on application rates, the composition of the applicant pool, and downstream program outcomes. In a second step, we use a randomized controlled trial to estimate effects of the program on four groups of outcomes: (i) employment, measured e.g. in terms of job retention, acquisition and lengths of employment spells, (ii) job quality and quality of life, including e.g. earnings and workplace conditions, (iii) mobility, e.g. migration intentions and behaviors, and (iv) firm-level outcomes, e.g. firm performance and employment."
