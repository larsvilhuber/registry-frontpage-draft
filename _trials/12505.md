abstract: "The San Antonio G.O.A.L.S. Initiative is the first randomized controlled trial to examine the effects of cash assistance in San Antonio, Texas. Methodist Healthcare Ministries of South Texas (MHM) commissioned this RCT that provides monthly cash payments of $500 to participants via pre-paid debit cards. Led by Dr. Melinda Denton (PI), a research team from UTSA is serving as the independent third-party evaluator for the study and has randomly assigned participants to treatment and control groups. Surveys will be administered to participants 5 times over the course of the study and semi-structured, in-person interviews will be conducted with a subset of participants. The primary research question is: “Does combining cash assistance with other services (i.e., a cash plus intervention) propel families further and/or faster toward economic self-sufficiency than providing cash assistance alone?”"
