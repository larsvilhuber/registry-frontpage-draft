abstract: "We replicate Gächter et al.'s (2017) 10-period public good game without punishment and with dynamic interdependencies, where each agent’s wealth at the end of period t serves as her endowment in t+1. In contrast to the original experiment, we use a non-student sample in a remote online experiment. While experiment with repeated group interactions have been conducted with click workers on platforms such as Amazon's MTurk before, we investigate how well this experimental design can be applied to the general German population. For this reason, we will draw comparisons to Gächter et al.'s (2017) original data and consider methodological challenges such as dropouts. If dropouts do not turn out to be a concern, we will rund additional treatments that incorporate risk or uncertainty.
