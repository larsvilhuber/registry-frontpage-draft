abstract: "Due to the large number of children at risk of not reaching their development potentials, developing countries need to find innovative methods that can ensure effective provision of high-quality early childhood programmes at scale. The goal of this study is to examine the effectiveness of integrating a multi-purpose parenting intervention that targets both nutrition and psychosocial stimulation into a pre-existing public health service in rural China. 206 natural villages will be randomly assigned to either control or treatment group. In collaboration with the National Health Commission (NHC) of the People’s Republic of China and Save the Children, the integrated programme builds on the existing health infrastructure and is delivered by village-level public health workers. 
In the treated natural villages, parenting trainers, selected by the HFPC, will provide parenting training on nutrition and stimulating activities via fortnightly home visits and monthly group activities. During each home visit, parenting trainers will first spend 30 minutes teaching the primary caregiver how to stimulate each child’s development through fun and interactive play activities (using a set staged-based curriculum), and then spend 10 minutes measuring child’s anthropometrics (height and weight) and providing nutrition guidance. For the group activities, parenting trainers will invite all assigned caregiver-baby dyads to join, and then hold a group reading/play/story session. The intervention will be provided for exactly one year from May 2019 to May 2020.
