abstract: "In this study, I explore the role that accounting rules, in particular the restrictiveness of GAAP, have played in the declining supply of accountants through both analysis of archival data and a survey-based field experiment. I find in my archival analyses that the restrictiveness of the profession has decreased the supply of accountants and accounting students. I find evidence that this has shifted the role of the accountant and has particularly deterred specific types of individuals: those who are creative, those who place greater importance on interest in their major, and those who value intrinsic factors over extrinsic factors in their career choice. I supplement these findings with a survey-based field experiment that (i) aims to identify the key reasons students avoid accounting through survey responses, and (ii) assesses whether the salience of restrictiveness can change studentsâ€™ perceptions of the profession."
