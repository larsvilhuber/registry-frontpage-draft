abstract: "Limited knowledge of financial concepts is associated with poor financial behavior such as low rate of formal savings and poor usage of bank accounts. Well-designed financial education programs have the potential to improve financial knowledge and behavior, leading to improvements in well being. In partnership with the World Bank and the Government of Rwanda, IPA is evaluating the impact of financial education, delivered through SACCOs, on clientsâ€™ financial knowledge, skills, attitudes, behavior, and overall welfare. The study design will measure direct effects of financial education as well as test variations in delivery channels. "
