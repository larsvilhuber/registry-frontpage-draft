abstract: "MDRC, in partnership with Abt Associates and MEF Associates, is conducting an evaluation of Individual Placement and Support (IPS) employment services implemented in a Federally Qualified Health Care (FQHC) setting, among individuals receiving behavioral health services. The evaluation is part of a broader study called Building Evidence on Employment Strategies (BEES). BEES is funded by the Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation within the Administration for Children and Families at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. FQHCs are community-based health care providers of primary care services to low-income and underserved populations. FQHCs deliver comprehensive primary care and preventive care to persons of all ages, regardless of their ability to pay or health insurance status. Two sites have been selected for this study: Harbor Care, Inc., in Nashua, New Hampshire, and Impact Behavioral Health Partners & PCC Community Wellness Center in Chicago, Illinois. Broadly, IPS is an evidence-based model for delivering employment services originally developed for people with serious mental illness and implemented in community mental health settings. This study is an opportunity to build upon the strong evidence base about IPS services to explore its effectiveness for patients receiving behavioral health services when implemented in an FQHC setting. The evaluation is using a randomized controlled trial to understand how access to IPS affects outcomes related to employment and earnings. Individuals receiving behavioral health services at the FQHC, who are eligible for and interested in receiving employment services, are assigned at random to a treatment group, who is offered IPS services, or to a control group, who are referred to other services in the community.  The goal is to enroll at least 800 individuals in the study. Outcomes will be measured over an 18-month follow-up period. The main outcomes to be measured are number of quarters employed during the follow-up period, total earnings during the follow-up period, and employment in the last quarter of follow-up."
