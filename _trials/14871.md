abstract: "Broadly speaking, this research is for a lab-in-the-field experiment that seeks to: 1) determine whether there is an “energy-efficiency gap” between consumer demand for energy-efficient technology and expected demand, as predicted by theory; 2) identify interventions that can reduce this gap; and 3) provide explanations for the existence and persistence of this gap. Primary outcomes include demand for an energy-efficient good and behavioral deviations from theoretical predictions of demand. Treatments involve providing information about energy efficiency, financial incentives, and model-augmented feedback on respondent decision-making. This feedback uses respondents’ stated preferences, beliefs, and previous choices as inputs.

The experiment is administered as an online survey to a sample of respondents who reside in the United States. Treatments are administered within- and between-subjects. Three measures of the primary outcomes are collected for each respondent: a baseline measure before information, after information, and after feedback."
