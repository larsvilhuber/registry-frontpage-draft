abstract: "The COVID-19 pandemic has increased mental health concerns around the world. While there are several papers linking COVID-19 to mental health, causal evidence on the topic remains limited. In this paper, we study the impacts of COVID-19 on mental health using priming techniques. We exogenously vary the salience of COVID-19 crisis among rural households in India to examine the effect of the pandemic on mental health. "
