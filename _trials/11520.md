abstract: "Through this paper I want to study the effect of a light-touch information intervention, among early childhood care and education providers in India, on motivation towards professional development /profession related equipment. Recurring professional development or in-service training of teachers (service providers) is one of the most important policy recommendations to improve the quality of education (services). However, literature has documented that such in-service training of teachers do not always lead to definitive results in form of teacher/student outcomes. It could be attributed to poor planning, poor quality of training, lack of teacher/trainee motivation, mismatch of perceptions among
trainees and training objectives, to name a few. This paper proposes to fill some of the gap in the literature, related to trainee motivation, by collecting data on teachers' (service-providers') perception regarding in-service training and testing if information about their content-knowledge gap motivates them to choose professional development related payoffs over cash payoffs.
