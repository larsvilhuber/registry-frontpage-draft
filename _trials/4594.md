abstract: "Increased prevalence of mobile phones in slum-communities is regarded as a key opportunity for eradicating poverty. Eventual impact of a mobile-phone-based intervention is conditionally dependent on users’ interaction with their mobile phones. In this paper, we attempt to shed some light on the dynamics of mobile data usage of slum-dwellers. This research project examines how data plans with shorter replenishment cycles impact poorer users’ interactions with their mobile phones. We expect that participants who are likely to binge-use their mobile phones may prefer plans with smaller replenishment cycles and may benefit more from using such plans."
