abstract: "In this study, we investigate the impact of highlighting flexible work opportunities in job advertisements on the number of applicants and the composition of the applicant pool. In collaboration with a recruiting service provider, we conduct a field experiment on social media platforms where potential candidates see job ads that highlight either work-from-home, flexible work hours, or no job characteristic. First, we test whether highlighting one of these flexible work options relative to no job characteristic increases the number of applicants, as well as the impact on the composition of the applicant pool. Second, we examine heterogeneities based on job profile."
