abstract: "Mental health disorders are among the leading causes of the global health-related burden. Mental health disorders are exacerbated by poverty and exposure to adversity like conflict and adverse shocks. Despite the high prevalence, adequate care for mental illness is mainly inaccessible in low- and middle-income countries. Given the bidirectional link between poverty and mental health and the limited mental health treatment in many low income settings, combining antipoverty interventions with psychotherapy delivered by non-specialists may be promising. Using a randomized control trial design, this study will compare the impact of a psychotherapy program, group Problem Management plus, with and without a one-time lump sum cash transfer on mental health, daily activities, and economic outcomes among Productive Safety Net Program clients in the regions of Amhara and Oromia.
