abstract: "This study examines the role of parental misperceptions and information gaps in contributing to the persistently high rates of child undernutrition in India. It is guided by two core hypotheses: 1) Parents systematically overestimate the nutritional status of their children (if parents form expectations about how healthy their child is by observing other children around them, then parents in areas with high levels of stunting and wasting may be more likely to believe that their own child is relatively healthy), and 2) Parents systematically underestimate the returns to child nutrition on long-term health, education, and labor market outcomes. These misperceptions, if proven true, may create a suboptimal equilibrium for child nutrition outcomes, trapping families in a cycle of inadequate nutrition. 

The study employs an individual-level three-arm randomized control trial with 1500 mothers of children aged 7-24 months in Telangana, India, to test whether providing mothers with information about their childâ€™s true relative nutritional status, and the returns to child nutrition on health, education, and labor market outcomes, will improve child feeding practices and health outcomes. It also examines how parents form expectations about child health and explore mechanisms through which misperceptions are formed in the first place.  "
