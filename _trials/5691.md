abstract: "This paper reports a field experiment showing that motivated cognition makes people fail to learn from important objective information. We find that when Chinese Muslim students were scheduled to take the high-stakes College Entrance Exam during the month of Ramadan, they exhibited strong patterns of motivated cognition to underappreciate the cost of fasting on exam performance. When randomly granted explicit
exemptions issued by religious leaders to break the fast, their motivated beliefs were significantly alleviated, which enabled them to more accurately interpret how fasting would affect exam performance, and made them more willing to break the fast during the exam.
