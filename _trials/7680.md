abstract: "This project examines whether news consumers are sophisticated enough to detect media bias using both observational and experimental data. The observational data from a Chinese micro-blogging platform suggests that users are more likely to repost "inconsistent" news,  defined as news with attitudes different from the media outlet's usual attitudes. To explore whether this reposting pattern reflects strategic thinking, we run an online experiment that randomly varies whether news sources are revealed to news consumers and tests its effect on their inference about the importance of news, tendency of reposting etc. "
