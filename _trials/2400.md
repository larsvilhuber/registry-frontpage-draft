abstract: "The market for residential solar panels in the United States is growing rapidly, bolstered by substantial government support at the federal, state, and local levels. Yet there are concerns that this support is primarily benefiting wealthier households, due to different electricity rates, liquidity constraints, landlord-tenant issues, length of tenancy, and perhaps even preferences (Borenstein and Davis 2016, Borenstein 2017). Accordingly, there has been increasing interest by policymakers and other stakeholders in expanding the adoption of solar to low and moderate income (LMI) households.

Community shared solar (henceforth, “community solar”) can help reduce up-front costs of installation, and also removes the need for a rooftop suitable for solar. It also allows households to still leverage economies of scale when they themselves have lower electricity needs. Thus it may be more attractive to LMI households. Furthermore, by providing a product that expands the markets to households that may not be able to install rooftop solar, we expect to see additional word-of-mouth and thus more total adoption of both community solar and rooftop solar.
