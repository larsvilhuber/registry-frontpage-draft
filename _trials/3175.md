abstract: "Promoting female empowerment through increased political participation remains a core policy challenge throughout the developing world.  In this work, we explore if information about women-centric work of incumbent politician can increase women participation in politics. Past work has shown that political participation can serve to improve female specific public policy and service delivery in countries such as India and Brazil. However, there is a dearth of evidence on whether women voters reward such decisions through increased political participation? If so, are these decisions independent of their male counterparts in the family or household? Our study will directly shed light on these questions by presenting evidence around the effect of information about women-centric policies on increased female political participation and subsequent electoral outcome.
