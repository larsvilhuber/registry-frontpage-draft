abstract: "This lab experiment investigates how a market intermediary affects the outcomes of a carbon offset market, and how a contractual mechanism can deliver the most socially desirable outcomes. A market intermediary is hypothesized to enhance market participation and market supplies through contract designs. In a baseline treatment, no intermediary or contract is provided to market suppliers who undertake both the production costs and market entry fees. Two intermediary treatments introduce two types of contracts: (1) a fixed price contract for each unit of supply; and (2) an uncertain price contract where the unit income is a share of the realized market price. In both intermediary treatments, the contract is provided to suppliers who have a high market entry fee, which can be avoided by accepting the contract price instead of the realized market price. This experiment also elicits subjectsâ€™ risk attitudes and demographic information."
