abstract: "We investigate firm take-up of two COVID-19 focused benefits which provide (i) wage support for workers who are kept on payroll and (ii) lines of credit backed by government guarantees.  We randomly assign firms to a series of treatment wings providing either information regarding the program, or a combination of information and step-by-step application support.  We plant to investigate the impact of these interventions on program take-up, borrowing, employment, and firm performance.
