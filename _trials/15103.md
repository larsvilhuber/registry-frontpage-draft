abstract: "This research explores the relationships between inequality, envy, and productivity in resource-sharing contexts. Building on behavioral economics and social psychology, this study investigates how inequality affects jealousy and subsequently influences individualsâ€™ economic behaviors, particularly effort and redistribution. The project will be situated in rural Kenya, where collectivist norms and informal redistribution mechanisms shape economic decisions. Using randomized control trials, we aim to identify the causal links between inequality and envy, the role of jealousy in sanctioning behaviors, and how visibility impacts effort choices. Two experimental designs are employed: the first examines social responses to inequality and the second evaluates effort disincentives in a workplace setting under varying types of conspicuousness. This study will contribute to understanding the socioeconomic dynamics of inequality and provide insights into policy interventions aimed at enhancing productivity and fostering equitable growth."
