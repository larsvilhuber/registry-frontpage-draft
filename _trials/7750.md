abstract: "When people choose what messages to send to others, they often consider how others will interpret the messages. A sender may expect a receiver to engage in motivated reasoning, leading the receiver to trust good news more than bad news, relative to a Bayesian. This paper experimentally studies how motivated reasoning affects information transmission in political settings. Senders are randomly matched with receivers whose politics happen to be aligned or misaligned with the truth, and either face incentives to be perceived as truthful or face no incentives. These incentives decrease the truthfulness of senders; instead, incentivized senders choose to send more false information to align with receivers' politically-motivated beliefs. The adverse effect of incentives is not appreciated by receivers, who rate senders in both conditions as being equally likely to be truthful. A complementary experiment further identifies motivated reasoning among receivers and senders' beliefs about receivers' motivated reasoning as the mechanism driving these results. In addition, senders are willing to pay to learn the politics of their receivers in order to send more targeted misinformation."
