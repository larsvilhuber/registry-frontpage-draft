abstract: "Impact evaluation of an entrepreneurship program implemented in Western Cote d'Ivoire.
The program focuses on promoting productive self-employment to sustain livelihoods, in a rural area which was hit by the post-electoral conflict of the last decade. It aims to sustain vulnerable populations through entrepreneurship training and access to financial capital. Shared prosperity is expected to reinforce social cohesion, as well as more direct interventions such as a peace building training, and repeated interactions with other ethnic groups during trainings and meetings. This is all the more relevant in this area which is ethnically fractionalized following conflict displacement."
