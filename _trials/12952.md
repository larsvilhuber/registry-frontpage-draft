abstract: "Among the challenges faced by communities hosting internally displaced people (IDP) the most important one might be to build trust between IDPs and local population. We investigate how local individuals interact with IDPs, and how these interactions differ according to the cultural distance between local and IDPs, where cultural distance is measured in terms of ethnicity, religion or language. To do so we conduct a field experiment in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. Participants are randomised between a control group, a group primed to increase empathy and a third one primed to view IDPs as contributors to their local communities and play standard economic games with IDPs from different cultural origins."
