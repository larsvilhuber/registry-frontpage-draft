abstract: "In information dissemination campaigns by agricultural extension services, seemingly small attributes, such as the way it is delivered or who it is delivered to, can result in significant differences in outcomes, such as knowledge transfer, adoption and yield. In the context of ICT-mediated knowledge transfer, this study investigates the role of the gender composition of the person(s) who provide the information and the gender composition of the person(s) who receive the information in making the information transfer more effective. In addition, video as a way to deliver extension information is augmented with a more demand-driven ICT solution, such as Interactive Voice Response (IVR). Effectiveness is assessed in terms of knowledge gain, adoption, yield increase, and poverty reduction. These research questions are answered through field experiments, where farmers are randomly assigned to particular interventions."
