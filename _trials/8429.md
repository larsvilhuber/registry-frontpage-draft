abstract: "Can Mobility Mentoring – a system of holistic, one-on-one mentorship combined with monetary incentives – help low-income residents achieve economic self-sufficiency? Specifically, we aim to examine the effects of Mobility Mentoring delivered through the AMP Up Boston program on participant economic outcomes (employment, earnings, household income, and financial health), housing stability, receipt of subsidized housing and other public benefits, and (if funding permits us to do follow-up surveys) health and well-being outcomes. With help from the Boston Housing Authority (BHA), Economic Mobility Pathways (EMPath) will recruit participants for the AMP Up Boston program from residents in BHA public housing and recipients of BHA housing vouchers and randomly assign access to the program among interested eligible residents. Treatment group participants will be able to receive three years of Mobility Mentoring Services, while control group participants will receive the services usually available to them in the community. We plan to follow study participants for ten years from random assignment through administrative data, allowing us to see whether recipients of Mobility Mentoring make temporary, short-term gains or sustainable, long-term changes in their economic situation."
