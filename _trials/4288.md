abstract: "This project aims to understand social motives and their interaction with instrumental motives in shaping individuals' decisions to participate in anti-authoritarian protests. We focus on the large protest in Hong Kong against the proposed Extradition Bill, which will take place on June 9th, 2019. We cross-randomize two treatment arms: (a) information that changes individuals' perceived pro-social and anti-social norms adhered by protest participants and non-participants; and (b) monetary incentives to participate in the protest. We then observe experimental subjects' protest participation decisions as our primary outcome of interest."
