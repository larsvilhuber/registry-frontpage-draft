abstract: "How to raise the quality of publicly provided services in in the face of tight resource constraints? In this project, we evaluate the introduction of a tech-based, low-cost platform allowing extra-judicial mediators in Peruvian free mediation centers to monitor their own performance. We assess the impact of the platform on both mediators' performance and on socio-economic characteristics of the users of these mediation services."
