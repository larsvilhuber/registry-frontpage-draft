abstract: "In this project, we study social contact through group activity as a possible channel to reduce discriminatory attitudes among people from different religion and caste groups. Using random group assignment, we allocate people from different social groups into different teams of about 5 women each where they perform several group activities and participate in the training. The experiment has been conducted in 30 slums in Kanpur with 155 groups of women, where an introductory level beautician course was delivered full-time to groups of five women over five days. Each day the training commenced at 8am and finished at 5pm with a one-hour break. Baseline and end line surveys (both post-training and a follow up six months after the training concluded) which captured perceptions about the other religion and castes reveal changes in attitude towards the hostile group as they interact and intermingle with each other during the training.
