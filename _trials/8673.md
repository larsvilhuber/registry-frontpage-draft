abstract: "How to frame nudging to students to motivate them to high achievement? To answer this question, we plan a large-scale randomized vignette experiment among university students that test the impact of differently framed nudging messages on students’ motivation. All students at the University of Szeged receive a random vignette via SMS out of eight possible vignettes. Vignettes describe students the hypothetical exam with systematically different wording along three dimensions (framing, regulatory focus, and exam difficulty). We test how the different descriptions of the vignettes influence students’ anticipated effort (our outcome) measured by students’ motivation in preparing for the hypothetical exam. "
