abstract: "We are currently running a field experiment of a novel microfinance product, inspired by the rotating structure of a ROSCA.  This is a scaled-up version of the product structure presented in CSAE Working Paper WPS/2014-32 (Afzal et al, `Two Sides of the Same Rupee?  Comparing Demand for Microcredit and Microsaving in a Framed Field Experiment in Rural Pakistan').  We are currently approaching the completion of fieldwork."
