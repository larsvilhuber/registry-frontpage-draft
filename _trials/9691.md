abstract: "We analyze the organization of corruption in a state agency. The dual mandate of the Democratic Republic of the Congo's traffic police agency is to manage traffic and to enforce the traffic code. We first document that, in the capital's branch, Kinshasa, traffic fines account for only 22% of the  revenue generated by the branch. The remaining 78%  of revenue comes from bribes  paid by drivers. 63% of revenue from bribes is generated through a "quota scheme:'' managers at police stations ask agents posted at street intersections to escort drivers to the stations, where the managers extract a bribe from the drivers themselves. Experimentally decreasing the quota level, hence mitigating its effect, we find that the quota scheme worsens the agency's ability to fulfill its first mandate, while not improving its ability to fulfill the second. First, the quota causes 65% of all  traffic jams and almost all  accidents  at the branch's intersections. Second, we find evidence suggesting that it fuels allegations against drivers that are more often false-extortion-than true, consistent with the scheme not creating  incentives to comply with the code. The findings emphasize that the manager's demand for bribes is significant and creates profits and distortions  beyond those that would be made possible via corruption by individual state officials."
