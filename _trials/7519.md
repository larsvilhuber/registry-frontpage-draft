abstract: "Economists have now recognized that agents' social perceptions and relations shape economic interactions. We propose a novel experiment with the objective to study whether the opposite direction is operative, namely whether the economic setting affects agents' social perceptions and potential relations with others. Our treatments exogenously vary the economic setting, and in a cross-subject study, subjects are asked their social evaluations of others in the different settings.
