abstract: "Discounting in experimental bargaining games has typically been implemented by shrinking
the pie along the game path. How one should implement real world discounting in a
laboratory setting to imitate real world trade-os is not obvious, and the procedure chosen
may impact on experimental outcomes. In this study we analyze whether the main results
found in Ochs and Roth (1989) replicate well when using delayed mobile phone payments to
implement discounting."
