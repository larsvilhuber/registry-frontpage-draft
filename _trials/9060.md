abstract: "Agricultural productivity in Sub-Saharan countries is low despite the existence of technologies available to farmers that might profitably increase yields. In this project, we propose that labor market frictions constrain the diffusion of new agricultural technologies. Specifically, we argue that take-up of new agricultural technologies might hinge upon the availability of a rural labor force skilled in these technologies, and that farmers may underinvest in training others in these skills if they cannot fully appropriate the returns of this training. We design an RCT in partnership with the NGO “One Acre Fund” in Burundi (OAF) to test the hypotheses that 1) contracting frictions that prevent farmers from fully appropriating returns from training contribute to inefficiently low level of training on these technologies in equilibrium and 2) that encouraging training and the increasing the stock of skilled workers can increase the adoption of productivity-enhancing technologies."
