abstract: "We implemented a randomized experiment in Romania to elucidate how messages, including general reminders and peer information, impact saving in an upper-middle income setting. We randomly selected 540 farmers from a rural region of Romania to participate in our study. Each participant was presented with an offer to join our experimental home-savings account and informed that after three months, the research team would revisit to observe the total accumulated savings and pay one percent interest on the balance. At baseline, all participants were asked whether they would like to set a savings goal and if so, how much they wished to save over the following months. In addition, participants were randomized into three groups. In the first group, participants received a general text message reminder to save. In a second group, participants received the general reminder and were also informed of the average savings goals of their peers. In a third, control group, participants received no text messages. Baseline was conducted in November 2017 and endline was conducted in March 2018. At endline, we measured and paid interest on the total savings in the experimental account. In our analysis, we compare savings outcomes across the three messaging treatment groups and conduct a heterogeneity analysis across the savings goal indicated at baseline."
