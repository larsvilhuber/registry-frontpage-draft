abstract: "Road traffic accidents in poorly regulated public transit is a leading cause of death in low- and middle-income countries. We study how providing information about bus safety to passengers affects the demand and supply of safer public transit when firms have market power. We collect measures of safe driving for buses belonging to five firms operating at one of the busiest long-range bus stations in Nairobi, Kenya, using a newly developed tracking device. In a first experiment, we privately inform passengers approaching the station which firm is the safest choice. Passengers do not respond to the treatment, although they are willing to switch for a small subsidy. In a second experiment, we then provide a public signal to both passengers and firms that buses are now being tracked. Passengers receiving private information about bus safety now respond by choosing the safe firm, and some firms provide safer services. We rationalize these effects in a game-theoretic model of firms facing different costs of providing safe services and derive welfare estimates of alternative equilibria. The model implies that the welfare effects of information interventions crucially depend on the nature of the market equilibrium."
