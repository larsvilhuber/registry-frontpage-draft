abstract: "We study an intervention that aims to engage adolescent girls, “Young Girl Leaders”, as ambassadors who are encouraged to speak out in their schools against the harmful stigma that surrounds the topic of menstruation in a context where material constraints to hygienic practices are also lifted. We aim to test whether the intervention, taking place in rural Madagascar, increases girls’ ability and willingness to attend school, increase their access to health-related information, and improve their psychosocial wellbeing, by reducing stigma and encouraging discussion of stigmatized topics,"
