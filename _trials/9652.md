abstract: "IRC’s central hypothesis for this pilot project is that when climate vulnerable communities have timely access to information and the financial and social resources to act upon that information, they will avoid negative coping strategies and build more diversified and climate resilient livelihoods.  Community members are acutely aware of how their environment is changing due to slow and sudden onset climate change, and these communities are rich with historical and new knowledge on climate change adaptation and mitigation measures. However, resource constrained communities lack effective systems to disseminate real-time information about climate risks and their potential severity and many households in resource constrained environments do not possess the financial means to implement adaptive or mitigation measures that would allow them to protect or adapt their livelihoods during a stress and/or shock. This is especially true in conflict-affected communities, where a lack of social cohesion and inter-community economic linkages can exacerbate vulnerabilities.

To test this hypothesis, the IRC will pilot the climate risk reduction payments in Adamawa state (northeast Nigeria) with smallholder farmers and livestock owners. The IRC will apply a systems approach, working within and with the existing ICT (radio, SMS, voice, mobile, etc.) systems, agriculture extension providers, and other key stakeholders within the government and community. Together with the local community, the IRC and Google.org will build on existing community resiliency strategies and local knowledge in developing a climate risk data platform incorporating climate, weather, economic, and crisis indicators—and will make the data available to the community members and local stakeholders. Then, over the course of the agricultural season, the pilot will deliver lump sum cash payments to participating target households when triggered by the data platform’s risk thresholds. IRC will design and implement a cash delivery program with the protection principles outlined in the IRC’s Safer Cash Toolkit, ensuring equitable and safe access for individuals, especially women.
