abstract: "By offering means-tested secondary school scholarships to a randomly selected subset of youth in Ghana, and comparing school enrollment and longer-term outcomes in cognition, health, employment, as well as attitudes and beliefs, between scholarship winners and a similar group of youth not offered a scholarship, this study aims to provide evidence on the barriers to enrollment and estimate the longer-run impacts of secondary education. 

Starting in 2017, we began tracking children of the respondents to assess the inter-generational impact of secondary education on cognitive development. This project is conducted in collaboration with Professor Elizabeth Spelke's Laboratory for Development Studies at Harvard University and Mark Walsh. "
