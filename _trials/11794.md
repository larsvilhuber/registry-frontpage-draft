abstract: "We conduct a field experiment in Rwanda that randomly offers individuals different monthly payment obligations (debt) in exchange for pledging varying shares of their future incomes (equity). Our experimental design identifies selection and treatment effects across both debt and equity dimensions of the experimental offers. Specifically, we randomly offer enrollees in income-share agreements (ISAs) the opportunity to lower their pledged income shares by 4 or 8 percentage points in exchange for flat monthly fees ranging from 1000 to 20,000 Rwandan francs. To identify moral hazard, we estimate the treatment effect of accepting a contract with a lower income-share obligation, using contract offers as instruments. To identify adverse selection, we compare individuals who received different menus of offers but ultimately pledged the same income share. Estimating treatment effects and selection patterns in earnings, repayment, and risk factors enables us to quantify the welfare losses associated with information asymmetries in equity-like contracts and identify market failures in household financing."
