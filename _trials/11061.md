abstract: "Observational studies have documented a negative effect of air pollution on the productivity of workers engaged in both cognitive and physical tasks in both outdoor and indoor settings. These studies typically rely on air pollution data from outdoor municipal monitoring stations along with fixed effects and/or instrumental variable econometric models. We will use a randomized controlled trial to identify the effect of air pollution on both labor productivity and absences in an indoor setting. We will use air quality monitors installed in the workplace to measure indoor air pollution and air purifiers to improve air quality in randomly selected workplace locations such as buildings, floors of buildings, or rooms within buildings."
