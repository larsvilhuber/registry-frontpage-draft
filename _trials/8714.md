abstract: "This study conducts a randomized control trial with students enrolled in the final year in vocational colleges in Vietnam. It evaluates the effects of soft skills training and career-counseling services on studentsâ€™ labor market outcomes. These interventions could potentially address two key challenges faced by vocational college students that we identified through pilot surveys in Vietnam. First, students graduate without the skills demanded in the labor market, in particular relevant soft skills. Second, there is a mismatch between students and available jobs/employers, which leads to low rates of employment and job retention. 

The RCT design involves four treatment arms: soft skills training (treatment 1); career counseling (treatment 2); soft skills training and career counseling (treatment 3); and neither soft skills training nor career counseling (control).
