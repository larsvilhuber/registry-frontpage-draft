abstract: "Access by individuals and businesses to beneficial and inexpensive financial services and products, also known as financial inclusion, is a critical pathway to poverty alleviation and economic growth in developing countries. While Armenia, the location of this study, has made many advances in financial inclusion over the past two decades, persistent geographic inequities between urban and rural regions mean that those outside the capital city have significantly lower levels of financial service adoption. To this point, most related programs in Armenia have focused on increasing financial inclusion through increasing financial awareness and literacy. Greater financial literacy, however, is likely a necessary but not a sufficient condition for broad financial inclusion in rural regions of Armenia. Awareness of financial products and an understanding of how they function can lead to greater demand for the product. However, even if demand exists, there can be significant constraints to greater financial inclusion. Rural residents must usually travel to larger towns to engage with the financial sector, which can potentially involve significant opportunity costs. This project thus plans to addresses this geographic constraint by taking advantage of the decreasing price of internet and internet-connected phones in Armenia, which has led to greater prevalence of these devices in rural villages. The intervention in this program focuses on training individuals in using mobile financial apps in rural villages, and using incentives to generate diffusion of this technology through the social networks of those trained. This project thus fills gaps in our knowledge both in the specific context of Armenia and in the general economics literature as to whether incentivized diffusion of mobile banking apps can lead to greater financial inclusion and positive economic outcomes. A better understanding of efficacy of this potential mechanism can allow better policy to be designed in various developing country contexts.
