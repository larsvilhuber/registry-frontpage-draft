abstract: "We conduct a randomized field experiment in cooperation with the Regional Water Company Prishtina to improve payment behavior for water among private customers in Pristina (Kosovo). In a first stage, we conduct interviews to investigate reasons for non-payment. In the second stage, we attach stickers to customers' invoices and highlight the most important numbers on the water bill. Customers can put these stickers as reminders to pay on the insider of their door. In total there are six sticker treatments. Three stickers types highlight the positive consequences of paying (gain) and three highlight the negative consequences of not paying (loss). Within each frame, we test two types of self-concept treatment over a basic sticker. The self-concept stickers intend to link the payment behavior to the self-concept of customers by persuasion (e.g., "Please be a responsible citizen") or attribution (e.g., "You are a responsible citizen")."
