abstract: "This trial extends the trial period for "Budgeting, Feedback, and Spending Decisions" (AEARCTR-0000889) and launches a replication of the original trial.

As of the date of this registration (October 30, 2015), the investigators have not received data regarding the spending decisions of individuals in the original study (AEARCTR-0000889).  The partner company that is implementing the trial, however, has been tracking user engagement as a result of the trial (the frequency with which individuals in the study use the mobile app).  The partner company has been pleased with the user engagement resulting from the trial and is expanding the research in two ways.  First, individuals who are in the original trial will continue to receive the treatment to which they were originally randomly assigned beyond October.  Second, additional individuals who are not part of the original trial will be randomized into a replication of the original trial.

The abstract from the original trial is pasted here:  Working with the developers of a mobile phone app that helps individuals track their spending, we study whether giving users regular feedback (via push notifications) on their progress relative to their budgets influences spending on bank cards and credit cards. Users are randomly assigned to receive progress updates relative to narrow budget goals or relative to broad budget goals. A third group is randomly assigned not to receive progress updates."
