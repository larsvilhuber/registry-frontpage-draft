abstract: "The use of autonomous ML based pricing algorithms has grown in many markets in recent years. Recent research shows that such pricing algorithms can increase prices by softening competition and potentially engaging in collusive behavior. Additional research shows that the design of algorithms affects the extent to which they produce supra-competitive prices. These findings create substantial uncertainty for policymakers and for firm managers. It is unclear to what extent software designers actively consider competition or other
“downstream” effects of widespread adoption of their algorithms in markets when designing them. It is also unclear to what extent firms using algorithms can influence software developer decisions and designs. While outsourcing algorithm development can help firms access a larger
pool of high skilled workers, and allow more firms to compete in markets where algorithms are being used, this outsourcing may make it harder for firms to have influence over the ethics of the algorithms being developed. Thus, our paper seeks to study 1) how third party programmers develop pricing algorithms, 2) whether third party programmer training affects how they develop pricing algorithms, 3) whether employers can influence how third party programmers develop pricing algorithms by increasing programmer awareness of revenue maximization, and the
consequences from price collusion."
