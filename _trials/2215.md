abstract: "Many young girls in developing countries experience early pregnancy and  lifelong dependence upon family and partners, which may prevent them from reaching their full productive and social potential. In this paper, we consider two potential barriers to female empowerment: lack of reproductive health knowledge and lack of economic opportunities, and report from a randomized control field experiment of an empowerment program involving 3485 adolescent girls in 80 schools in rural Tanzania. One group was randomly offered a training program on reproductive health, a second group was offered a program on entrepreneurship while a third group was offered both training programs."
