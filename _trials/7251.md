abstract: "We provide students with the information about peers' major choices and future job prospects to examine the importance of peer choices and the returns to education in college enrollment decisions. Our study subjects are grade-12 students in 17 high schools who are about to graduate and make educational choices. Students in one treatment arm are provided with major-disaggregated information about their peers' preferred major choices and future job prospects. Students in the other treatment arm are provided with the disaggregated information only about future job prospects. We measure students' beliefs about peers' preferred choices and the returns to tertiary education before and after the intervention and also collect the data about students' actual college choices."
