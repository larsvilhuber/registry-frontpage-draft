abstract: "Can providing access to childcare services for three to five years old children (i) improve children’s educational (and health) outcomes, (ii) stimulate the development of female businesses and (iii) improve the effectiveness of mainstream business development interventions, such as business grants? These are the key research questions that we plan to address in this research.

Microenterprises are an important source of employment, and developing such enterprises is a key policy concern in most countries, and especially in low-income countries where they employ more than half of the labor force (Hipple, 2010; de Mel et al., 2008). But while there is a lot of optimism about the power of finance for small-scale business development, a growing literature shows that success cannot be taken for granted and may critically depend on the entrepreneur’s gender, educational background, and business skills. 

The links between familial obligations and business development are highlighted by a number of recent studies. Using capital grants to measure returns to capital in Sri Lankan microenterprises, De Mel et al (2009) show that male-owned microenterprises had high returns to capital, while female-owned enterprises did not benefit from the grants.  Fafchamps et al (2014) find that in Ghana, grants to microenterprises have differential effect by gender of the entrepreneur and by kind of transfer (in cash or in kind). Berge, Bjorvatn and Tungodden (2015) show that combining human and financial capital interventions caused a substantial improvement for male entrepreneurs, but not for female entrepreneurs. The authors suggest that social constraints - and in particular domestic obligations - could be an important explanation for the lack of impact for female entrepreneurs.

In this project, we propose an innovative way to study microenterprise development, by fully integrating domestic constraints in the study of business development and by combining a direct business support intervention with a family support intervention. We will collaborate with BRAC in Uganda to conduct a randomized experiment that will provide randomly selected women with: (i) subsidized access to childcare (the family support intervention) (ii) a business grant (the business support intervention) (iii) childcare and a business grant together (to understand complementarities). A fourth group will be kept as control.
