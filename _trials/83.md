abstract: "To examine the impact of expanding access to basic bank accounts, we set up three randomized evaluations in rural areas of Malawi, Uganda, and Chile. In each study site, we sample around 2,000 unbanked households living within reach of the branch, and sponsor basic accounts at local bank branches for a randomly selected half of them. We examine take-up of the accounts. In Malawi and Uganda, we use three rounds of follow-up surveys to study treatment effects on total savings as well as downstream outcomes over two years. "
