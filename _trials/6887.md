abstract: "The registered study is a clustered randomized controlled experiment (RCT) examining the impacts of digital-based agricultural extension on farmer’s adoption of smart farming technologies in Inner Mongolia, China. We conduct this RCT with a total of 115 rural villages in two counties in Inner Mongolia, Northwest of China. The selected counties are typical semi-arid climate conditions, maize production is the main staple grain, and the local farming relies on underground water irrigation. Focusing on maize farmers, this study investigates farmers’ adoption of an additional data-driven technology on top of the drip irrigation system they currently use. We explore how a video-mediated agricultural extension program affects farmers’ knowledge about data-driven technologies and the resulting adoption behavior. Furthermore, we examine the adopters’ maize production as well as their water and chemical fertilizers usage; that is, the economic and environmental consequence of adopting data-driven technologies. This study aims to shed light on the effectiveness of digital agricultural extension in overcoming farmers’ knowledge barriers. "
