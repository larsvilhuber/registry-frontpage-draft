abstract: "Most governments of developed countries offer some form of tax benefits to encourage charitable giving. The efficacy of such policies eventually depends on whether donors are attentive towards these policies and what (mis)perception donors have.  A rich tax literature has demonstrated that consumers are inattentive to value-added taxes when they are not salient and that individuals have misperceptions concerning complex tax incentives. There is little evidence whether salience and information provision of tax deductions might matter for donations. Furthermore, it is not clear whether the results from previous studies in the tax literature that test for salience and information provision would translate to charitable giving, since making extrinsic incentives more salient could potentially crowd out intrinsic motivation.  Whether more salient tax incentives and information provision could induce donors to give more is therefore an empirical question. This research project aims to answer this question by conducting an online field experiment on Germany's largest online platform for charitable giving. The intervention will take place on the payment page of the platform, where potential donors decide how much they wish to donate, after which they should fill in the required fields and complete the payment for the donation. For each website visitor, I exogenously vary whether information is provided on tax benefits. "
