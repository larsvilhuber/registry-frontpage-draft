abstract: "We propose a randomized controlled trial to study the impact of an unconditional money transfer on consumption among French households. Participants receive a monetary transfer in the form of pre-paid debit cards; the treatment and control groups vary in whether (and how fast) the available funds on the card decrease over time, as well as whether participants are subject to a framing treatment. We study the differences in the consumption response to these treatments, and their heterogeneity with observed characteristics."
