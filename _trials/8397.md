abstract: "We present a field experiment designed to understand the role of herding in collective action, and to disentangle the mechanisms that can drive it. Subjects will be exposed to online petitions via Facebook ads. They will be given messages containing information about the number of individuals who signed each petition, and about their attitudes towards petition. By comparing the fraction of subjects who signed the petition after each message, we will be able to observe the effect that knowledge of participation by others has on individual decisions to participate. We will also observe the extent to which this effect is driven by concerns about being pivotal, or by the willingness to be a part of a successful political movement."
