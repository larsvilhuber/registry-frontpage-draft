abstract: "The prospect of upward mobility (POUM) hypothesis finds that individuals who are poorer than the average optimally choose to oppose redistribution policies because they expect to be richer in the future, assuming full rationality, a mobility process that is concave in expectations, redistribution policies that last for a sufficiently long period, and individuals not too risk-averse. This is defined as the POUM effect. However, full rationality, on which the POUM hypothesis is based, seems to fail empirically. This leaves open some questions about determinants of the POUM effect, concerning the effect of self-confidence and entitlement on redistribution preferences. I designed an experiment in which the mobility process is endogenously modified by individuals’ relative performances or luck, and it is characterized by the POUM effect or not based on performances or luck. It has a certain and uncertain part, with the uncertain part being dependent on the experiment’s outcomes. Individuals expressed their redistribution preferences three times. First, they expressed their redistribution preferences with no future mobility. Second, decisions were taken knowing that there was future mobility and estimating the unknown part of the mobility function through expectations of subjects’ relative performance or luck, introducing the self-confidence or optimism effect. Finally, subjects made choices knowing that there was future mobility and their actual mobility function, introducing the entitlement effect across treatments. Other determinants of redistribution preferences, such as risk aversion and individual characteristics, are controlled through a specific test and a questionnaire."
