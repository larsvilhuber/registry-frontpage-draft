abstract: "Media content is often distorted (e.g. towards negativity or ideology) and a growing body of evidence suggests that an important reason for this is the demand side. Digitalization enables journalists to learn about the reading preferences of their audiences in detail and rewards respecting reader preferences in content production much stronger than traditional news settings. Could the shift in incentives thus amplify certain biases in the media? And if so, what would be the consequences for consumers?
In a first study, I aim to shed some light on this with a focus on biases in tonality. I will experimentally vary incentive schemes in content decisions of real journalists in a controlled survey experiment to gain a better understanding of journalistic content choices and their effects on the beliefs, emotions, and behavior of readers."
