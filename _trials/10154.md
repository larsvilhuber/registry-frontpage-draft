abstract: "Individuals with criminal records often have very low voting rates in states where they are legally eligible to participate in elections. Misinformation about eligibility, lack of knowledge, and lack of interest are all thought to prevent this population from voting. Even though text messaging interventions to increase voting rates are commonplace among the general population (even if not very effective), it is unclear whether text messaging can address barriers to voting among system-impacted groups (i.e., individuals with records, those with incarceration histories, and those affected by a family member’s incarceration), who have unique needs and challenges to voting. 

Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we experimentally test whether and how text messaging interventions can address misinformation and low motivation among system-impacted groups to increase their electoral participation. Within the RCT, we leverage insights from adaptive text messaging interventions, which address variation in individuals’ responses to interventions by tailoring treatment to time-varying characteristics observed throughout the study. Using information about participants’ registration status by the state’s registration deadline, we adjust our interventions to tailor prospective messages accordingly. This design is well-suited for the identification of efficient ways to address heterogeneity in voting behavior in the weeks leading up to an election, and will move forward the knowledge about electoral participation among system-impacted individuals.
