abstract: "Remote surveys in low-income settings, particularly in East Africa, are common, though currently include a range of common practices without clear best practices and are predominantly the purview of market researchers, with limited application in academic research practices to-date. Yet, differences in survey response rates and data quality across different modes of remote data collection and survey design features is of key importance as remote research becomes more popular in light of COVID-19, both for academics and organizations. This study tests for differences in response rates, data quality and substantive responses across two of the most common modes of remote data collection -  phone and SMS surveys - and across core features of the survey design - question order, pre-communication, and completion incentive. This study is conducted using a survey on COVID-19 in Kenya amongst a low-income urban population, and the substantive content covers economic, psychological, and physical effects of COVID and a set of basic economic preference outcomes. The study aims to give robust evidence to validate methods for researchers and provide best guidelines for optimal survey design.
