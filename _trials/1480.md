abstract: "A randomized evaluation in Chile finds that providing a 3-month program of small group tutoring to fourth graders using college student volunteers raise language scores and measures of attitudes towards reading for some subgroups of the population. In particular, students from low-performing and poor schools in areas in which the program was implemented increased their performance in a reading test by between 0.15 and 0.20 standard deviations and improved significantly their self-perceptions as readers. Researchers also present cost-effectiveness analyses and find that for the students for which the program was effective the program was in the range of the current estimates."
