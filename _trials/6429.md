abstract: "This experiment aims to test the validity of the results found in an exploratory experiment. 

In February - March 2020, we ran a first online survey on Prolific in which we sought to explore the determinants of the acceptability of food policies (information campaigns, labels, taxation, and withdrawal from the market). We focused on three types of products (sugar, palm oil and cage-eggs) contained in snacks like cereal bars. Participants were asked to report the acceptability level of each policy for a given topic (sugar, palm oil or cage-eggs) and whether they would hypothetically vote for their implementation. 

We explored 9 factors for the acceptability of food policies:
- Legitimacy of the state to intervene
- Awareness of the externalities at stake
- Scientific norm on the topic
- Social norm on the topic
- Effectiveness of the proposed policy
- Targeting of the consumers of the proposed policy
- Coerciveness of the proposed policy
- Majoritarian support for the proposed policy
- Inequalities resulting from the proposed policy

We found support for all variables but scientific norm. We also found evidence for an interaction effect between awareness and coerciveness: the more the policy is seen as coercive, the more awareness has an impact on the acceptability of the food policies. "
