abstract: "This study aims to examine the impact of directly introducing firms to investment partners (i.e., investors, accelerators, incubators) in Africa on deal generation and, ultimately, firm growth. We provide firms with opportunities for direct introductions to these partners within a randomized controlled trial setting. Our goal is to measure the causal impact of these introductions on various investment and business outcomes. Investment outcomes include active interaction between firms and investment partners, such as meetings to discuss potential investments, investments made by the partners, and the value of those investments. Business outcomes include revenue and number of employees."
