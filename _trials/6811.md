abstract: "This study consists of a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of a “mobile creches” childcare intervention implemented through the Labor-Intensive Public Works (LIPW) component of a youth employment and skills development project in Burkina Faso. The LIPW project aims to increase access to temporary employment and skill development opportunities for out-of-school youth in 9 regions of the country. The study sample includes 2,036 female public works participants in 36 work sites, with 18 sites randomly selected to receive mobile creches and no childcare provision introduced in the remaining 18 sites. The study aims to measure the impact of the mobile creches on child development outcomes and public works participants’ employment outcomes, time use, and well-being. "
