abstract: "Within a large retail chain we introduce a bonus payment and provide more autonomy in decision making for store managers, implementing a 2x2 experimental design. The bonus is based on the storeâ€™s profit contribution margin (= sales - costs of goods sold - inventory shrinkage - personnel costs).
Store managers in one region in South-East Germany are randomly assigned to one of four treatments. 25% of store managers receive a bonus based on the contribution margin. Another 25% of store managers receive more autonomy in their work by allowing them to decide on the items placed in front of the cash desk. 25% of store managers receive both, the bonus and the additional autonomy. The remaining 25% serve as control group. 
Based on a theoretical model we study the following hypotheses: The bonus payment will increase the contribution margin and will do so to a stronger extent when it is accompanied by an increase in decision autonomy. We also hypothesize that the granting of autonomy alone (without the bonus) can have countervailing effects. On the one hand, store managers can make better use of local knowledge in decision-making and may be motivated by the increase in autonomy. On the other hand, decentral autonomy can have a cost if less able store managers cannot make effective use of their local knowledge.
