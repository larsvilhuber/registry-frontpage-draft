abstract: "Within a large retail chain, we randomly assign store managers to either a performance-contingent bonus or a fixed bonus payment. The performance-contingent bonus is based on the storeâ€™s profit contribution margin (= sales - costs of goods sold - inventory shrinkage - personnel costs). "
