abstract: "We evaluate the impacts of a low-cost lean manufacturing consulting program aimed at optimizing plant-floor production. The Brazil More Productive is a national-level program that subsidizes consulting services to small and medium firms. We are conducting a randomized phase-in trial to investigate the impacts of this program on productivity. We will also document changes in management practices, owners/managers' perception of their production environment, and reasons for not having adopted these practices before the intervention.
