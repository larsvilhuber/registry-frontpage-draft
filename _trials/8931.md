abstract: "A vast literature has documented the importance of cultural beliefs and norms for economic performance. In search of the ultimate link between beliefs and prosperity, an obvious role has been suggested for religion. Evangelicalism is among the most dynamic religious movements in the world and is the fastest growing portion of Christianity. Yet despite this expansion, little is known about the evangelical movementâ€™s expansion, especially at the individual level. 

This project examines the causal impact of joining the evangelical movement on economic well-being and various other socioeconomic outcomes. The impact will be assessed using a randomized-control encouragement design.
