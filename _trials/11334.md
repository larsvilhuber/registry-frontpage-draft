abstract: "Electronic game now has a new version for its gambling part which is called pity system which gives player a guaranteed one time of win after a consecutive number of loss. The effect of this pity system to people’s purchasing preference of electronic lottery is unclear especially when game companies have adopted this system in their games. We design a online experiment to test the effect of this new system and to find whether pity system increase people’s preference to buy the lottery by person or by group."
