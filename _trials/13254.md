abstract: "According to India’s National TB Prevalence Survey 2019-2021, 64% of those who display symptoms of pulmonary Tuberculosis (TB) do not seek healthcare. We designed a survey-based experiment to test the effectiveness of short (~1 minute) audio-visual messages on self-reported intention to seek medical advice for TB when experiencing a cough. The messages leverage behaviourally informed strategies to address potential barriers to seeking care for TB.
