abstract: "In this study, we use a lab experiment to investigate individuals’ reaction after a defeat. In a
first stage, subjects complete a math task and decide on their payment scheme (piece-rate vs
tournament). Subjects observe the result of the competition and decide whether they want to
compete again. A novelty of our design is that we use strategy elicitation method by providing
a sequence of potential points gap. Our research seeks to elicit men’s and women’s behaviors
in a repeated competition context. Our results show that men are more willing to re-enter the
competition with a larger point gap when being defeated by a female opponent, compared to
when they loose against their male counterparts. On the other hand, women are indifferent to
the gender of their opponent when deciding to compete again."
