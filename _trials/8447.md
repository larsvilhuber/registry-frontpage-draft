abstract: "Sports betting is a widespread phenomenon and an increasingly important concern for policymakers throughout the world. This study will investigate the betting behavior of low-income individuals in the context of a developing country. The core hypothesis is that gamblers misperceive the odds behind the lotteries they face and that such misperceptions are more prominent in the context of sports betting when behavioral biases such as overconfidence can play a more significant role. We will test this hypothesis by comparing subjects' behavior and subjective expectations when lotteries are framed as sports events with behavior and expectations in the face of neutrally framed lotteries.
