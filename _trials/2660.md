abstract: "To help address India's high rates of child malnutrition, the Indian government launched the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) program in 1975, and has substantially expanded the program in the last decade. The program provides pre-school education and primary healthcare services to children under 6 years of age. Today, the program is the largest of its kind in the world, reaching about 25% of all children in India under the age of 6 (39.7 million children) by 2010. However, take-up of ICDS services today remains low. In this project I ask, what is the impact of providing feedback on workers' own performance, as measured by utilization of services and malnutrition of children, in addition to feedback on performance of workers they regularly interact with? The proposed experiment is low-cost, can easily be scaled up, and will also help to shed some light on the cases in which performance feedback and social comparisons might be most effective. "
