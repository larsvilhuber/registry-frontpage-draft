abstract: "Schizophrenia is a severe global mental health problem. Previous studies have suggested different psychological interventions to reduce the severity of schizophrenia symptoms in developing countries. In Pakistan, there has been a lack of research to address this issue and to introduce a measure to overcome this gap. This study aimed to develop a unique intervention to improve the severity of symptoms in individuals with schizophrenia in Pakistan. The purpose of this research was to cross-culturally validate the Metacognitive Training for psychosis (MCT), and to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of delivering MCT to individuals with schizophrenia in Pakistan. This study was a pre-post design, parallel two arm, double blinded, feasibility, randomized controlled trial. Sixty participants (experimental group, n=30; control group, n=30) were recruited from the departments of psychiatry of various hospitals across Rawalpindi and Islamabad from August to November 2022. Four instruments (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Beck Cogntive Insight Scale, World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule, World Health Organization Quality of Life scale) were used to assess symptom severity, cognitive insight, disability, and quality of life in individuals with schizophrenia. A two-way factorial ANOVA was used to examine the efficacy of MCT in reducing symptom severity, cognitive insight, disability, and quality of life. The results of this study demonstrated that MCT was effective in reducing symptom severity and cognitive insight in patients with schizophrenia as compared to the treatment as usual. On the other hand, the results also revealed that MCT was not significantly effective in improving quality of life and disability in patients with schizophrenia. This study will help improve schizophrenia treatment in Pakistan and create insight in policy makers so they can incorporate this therapy in various hospitals across the country."
