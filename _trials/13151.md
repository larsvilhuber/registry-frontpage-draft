abstract: "This paper experimentally tests multiple multi-attribute choice models such as a range normalization model and a pairwise normalization model in a consumer context. The experimental design generates choice sets that can distinguish the models as each model predicts a distinct set of demand types. Specifically, we do comparative statics by investigating how choice probabilities of alternatives vary between choice sets. Moreover, we do a cross-validation exercise by constructing a maximum likelihood in the spirit of Harless and Camerer (1994)."
