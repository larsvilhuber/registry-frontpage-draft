abstract: "Bhutanese students are required to choose among four academic streams when they complete lower secondary school education. Only students in Science stream can apply for STEM degrees in college. Bhutan Ministry of Education and Asian Development Bank conduct an experiment to examine the effects of providing career mentoring to students who are about to decide which academic track to follow at upper secondary school. Our treatment involves one-to-one meetings between mentors who are students currently pursuing a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in STEM subjects in college and lower secondary school students. These meetings provide students with information about the importance of STEM education, student life, labor market information and job prospects of STEM students, as well as entry requirements and application process to Science stream at upper secondary school.
