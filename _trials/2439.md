abstract: "Where refugees go, how they fare when they get there, and how they impact the receiving state economically and politically are a function of international institutions, including norms, laws, and practice. Yet no experimental studies to date have examined how international norms affect the willingness of refugee-receiving state citizens to accept refugees. Given this gap in the literature, this study attempts to determine how refugee-related international norms shape citizens' attitudes toward their country's accepting large numbers of them. The study uses a survey experiment conducted via approximately 1150 face-to-face interviews throughout Turkey in September 2017. The survey experiment tells respondents about a hypothetical new Turkish policy that would deny entry to any new Syrian refugees and asks them how much they support it. In describing the refugee situation, the experiment randomly varies part of the description, giving the respondents one of five statements about how international norms promote or discourage accepting the refugees. The collected data will be used to test a series of hypotheses about the normative and coercive effect of international law on citizens' attitudes toward state foreign policy.
