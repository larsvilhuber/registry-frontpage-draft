abstract: "Fischbacher and Foellmi-Heusi (2013) introduced the die-rolling task to investigate lying behavior in the laboratory. Subjects are asked to roll a 6-sided die in private and report the number they rolled. The higher the number they report, the more money they gain, unless it is a 6, which leads to a payoff of zero. Since the actual result of the die roll cannot be observed by the experimenter, there is an incentive to cheat by reporting a higher number and thereby getting a higher payoff. An important aspect of this approach is that lying can only be detected on the aggregate, but not on the individual level by comparing the observed distribution with the uniform distribution of a die roll. The advantage is that potential demand effects are reduced and that real lying behavior can be observed. The downside is that it makes the measurement of lying behavior noisy and does not allow to track a single subject. In this experiment, we want to investigate the effect of using a digital die. Subjects learn that every result of the digital die roll is stored, but not checked by the experimenter for the purpose of the payment. If using the digital die leads to the same lying pattern as in Fischbacher and Foellmi-Heusi (2013), this would be a strong motive to use the digital die since it keeps the demand effect low, is easy to implement and offers the additional advantage of allowing to observe individual behavior."
