abstract: "This project aims to understand how team interactions between individuals of different socioeconomic levels affect social mobility in Latin America. We will conduct a series of lab-in-the-ﬁeld experiments to explore whether the opportunities for low-income individuals to move up the labor market ladder depend on their productivity and how they are perceived in environments populated by high-income individuals. Specifically, our project seeks to understand how the socioeconomic composition of a team affects team performance and whether revealing or concealing information about these characteristics impacts others’ perception of abilities, team interactions, and the recognition of leadership within a group. Our ﬁndings can provide insights into how team interactions can impede social mobility, thereby guiding public policies to enhance social mobility in the region."
