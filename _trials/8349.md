abstract: "Washington State provides reemployment services to unemployment insurance claimants through the Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessment (RESEA) program. We aim to measure the net impact of this program on claimants' job search and career outcomes. To do so, we will use a randomized controlled trial, where some claimants are selected to participate in the RESEA program and some are not. We will analyze administrative records to measure average program effects on claim duration, the likelihood of finding a job, wages and earnings once reemployed, and the quality of the employer-employee match. We will use two econometric models to estimate employer-employee match quality, both of which are built on the canonical Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999) model. We anticipate that we will collect experimental data for at least one year.
