abstract: "Experiments on the repeated prisoner's dilemma (RPD) have recently gained traction making predictions among an "embarrassing" richness of cooperative and non-cooperative equilibria. The most popular experimentally motivated refinement is Blonski and Spagnolo's (2015) riskiness. The idea is to relate the prisoner's other dilemma of selecting among different cooperative and non-cooperative strategies to the equilibrium selection problem in static coordination games. Using systematic variations in RPD payoffs and a novel measure of attitudes towards the risk/efficiency trade-off in coordination games, the present study is the first direct test of the theory."
