abstract: "The objective of this experiment is to test two innovative interventions to increase the use of credit and savings products by women entrepreneurs in Peru. A qualitative study carried out as part of the preparation of the RCTs identified behavioral biases related to self-efficacy, present bias and cognitive overload that affect the entrepreneurs’ behavior, and the two interventions are designed to address these biases. The interventions target existing clients of two important regulated financial institutions, which provides a route to scale should the interventions prove effective."
