abstract: "People often rely on advice from e.g., parents, teachers and colleagues to make important career decisions. We use an online experiment to study gender differences in self-promotion and career advice. For this purpose, we ask participants in the role of advisers to give advice to "workers" (other participants in the experiment). We study whether male and female workers receive different advice, and if so, whether these differences are driven by a gender gap in worker self-promotion or by other factors. We also examine whether any gender gap in advice we uncover can be reduced by changing the information available to advisers."
