abstract: "There exist numerous studies on the evaluation of active labor market policies (ALMP) for unemployed job seekers. Recent experimental evidence suggests positive effects of job search assistance and counseling programs on treated individuals, while the evidence for the participation in training programs is rather mixed. For Europe, the evidence on training programs is mostly based on non-experimental studies and does not focus on long-term unemployed workers. 

In this project, we evaluate a program for unemployed social welfare recipients which (i) supports them in defining their professional project and (ii) offers a training which corresponds to this professional project and which helps them learn or update the skills needed in the occupation and sector they want to work in. 
The program “Parcours d'Entrée dans l'Emploi” (PEE) has been introduced for social welfare recipients (“Revenu de Solidarité Active”, RSA) in September 2019. The participants are usually long-term unemployed individuals who are detached from the labor market and struggle to enter stable employment paths. Moreover, being away from the labor market might lead to a breakdown of those individuals’ social bonds.  
In this project, we evaluate the impact of participation in the program PEE on the probability of having a clearly defined professional project, entering (stable) employment, and the level of social inclusion. We will use rich administrative data to observe employment outcomes, transfer receipt and participation in ALMP, and combine this with survey data which allows us to – among other things - observe the professional project of the unemployed and their level of social inclusion.
