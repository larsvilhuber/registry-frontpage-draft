abstract: "Price-level targeting (PLT) is optimal under the theory of rational expectations (RE), i.e. when expectations are in line with the monetary policy rule, but lacks empirical support. Given the hurdles to the implementation of macroeconomic field experiments, we utilize a laboratory forecasting group experiment --  where expectations come from human subjects  -- to collect data on expectations, inflation and output dynamics under the traditional inflation targeting (IT) framework and PLT confronted with both deflationary and cost-push shocks. This sequence of shocks is designed to approximate the recent course of events. We add a third treatment where PLT is augmented with central bank communication about the time-dependent inflation rate that would be consistent with closing the price gap in each period. Under RE, this additional piece of information is redundant because agents are supposed to form model-consistent expectations. "
