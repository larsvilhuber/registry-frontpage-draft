abstract: "Access to financial services is a problem for millions across Africa. The challenge is especially acute for women in rural and peri-urban areas. Digital financial services (DFS) are growing fast — over 10 million transactions take place each day and allows millions of people to take advantage of all that financial access has to offer: savings, loans, payment transfers, access to credit, and most importantly, the opportunity for economic development for families. However, while DFS is gaining traction in urban centers like Maputo, Mozambique,  use of DFS has been slower to expand in sparsely populated markets like rural Nampula Province, where this study is focused. Families in rural Nampula without access to financial services are vulnerable to income shocks that affect most local households like illness, job loss, and agricultural variations that effect crop quality.    

In this context, we conduct an impact evaluation of a novel mobile money (MM) registration and education process with M-Pesa in Mozambique. This process: 1) randomizes the neighborhoods where female and male promoters work to register new clients; 2) randomizes the content of the SMS messages customers receive (⅓ of the sample will get no messages; ⅓ will get “nudge” messages with information on where/when to use MPesa and remind people that it is Malaria season and they can use MPesa to buy health commodities, ⅓ will receive those same nudge messages but personalized); 3) offer incentives for promoters registering women on MPesa and registering women in hard-to-reach markets on MPesa.
