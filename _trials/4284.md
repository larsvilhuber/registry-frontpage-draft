abstract: "In this study we analyze intergenerational effects of factory jobs. We ask whether working in manufacturing factories affects womenâ€™s aspirations for their daughters, in terms of education, occupational choice, and overall empowerment. As possible channels, we will investigate how women perceive these jobs in terms of appropriateness/social stigma, if women update their beliefs about the content of the job in terms of skills and physical strength required and health impacts, and if the work affects their income and social networks."
