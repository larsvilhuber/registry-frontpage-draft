abstract: "This project will evaluate an theory-driven economic intervention to reduce men’s engagement in transactional sex and other risky behaviors. Leveraging innovations in mobile financial services and research on savings behavior in low-income countries, we will test an intervention that seeks to motivate income-earning men in western Kenya to reduce their spending on high-risk health behaviors (transactional sex and alcohol use) and instead save their disposable income in local bank accounts. Bank accounts will include additional incentives to save in the form of lottery-based rewards linked to amounts saved. The intervention will also encourage participants to develop savings goals and strategies, and provide periodic reminders about saving regularly. Through a direct economic mechanism (incentives to shift expenditures from the present to the future) and a psychological mechanism (increasing future orientation), we hypothesize that the intervention will result in increased savings, reduced spending on transactional sex and alcohol, less risky sexual behavior, and reduced risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). 

We will conduct a randomized controlled trial among men who are at high risk of HIV and others STIs and determine the effects of a savings intervention on health and economic outcomes. Specific aims of the project are as follows. Aim 1: Determine the impact of the intervention on incidence of HIV and other STIs. Aim 2: Quantitatively and qualitatively assess mechanisms of behavior change among participants and a sample of their female partners. By testing an intervention to promote forward-looking behavior and reduce the risk of acquiring HIV and other STIs in a high HIV/STI burden setting, this project has great potential for scientific and public health impact.
