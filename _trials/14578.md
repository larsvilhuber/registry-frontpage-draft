abstract: "The rapid spread of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) tools, such as ChatGPT, is expected to significantly enhance labor productivity. However, their impact on different populations in the labor market remains unclear. For instance, previous research has shown that there is a significant difference in competitive preferences between men and women, which is closely related to the gender wage gap in the labor market. AIGC tools, serve as a disruptive technology, possibly serve as an additional resource that change the existing gender wage gap. On the one hand, AIGC tools may reduce gender differences in productivity in certain industries with simple tasks, but on the other hand, they may exacerbate gender inequality due to inherent differences in confidence and technology acceptance between the genders. Thus, the impact of AIGC tools on labor market competition and gender inequality is still uncertain. Taking ChatGPT as an example, this study conducts a behavioural experiment to investigate whether the availability and suitability of ChatGPT significantly affects competitive preferences and task performance, and whether these effects differ by gender. In detail, participants will experience the stages following the classic competition willingness experiment by Niederle & Vesterlund (2007), and their competition willingness will be measured by the choice-based scheme on whether to compete under different payment schemes (piece rate or tournament). We have two dimensions of treatment, the availability of ChatGPT and the suitability of tasks, that constitutes four conditions and it aims to explain the overall effects of ChatGPT on the labor market. This is because different levels of availability and suitability will result in different usage effects or confidence incentives, which will have distinct impacts on willingness to compete and performance. In addition, by comparing the competitive preferences and task performance across groups and genders, we can analyze the impact of ChatGPT usage on gender differences. The results of this study aim to provide substantial recommendations and guidance for future technological development and labor market policies, ensuring that the potential of AIGC tools is fully realised and that technological progress benefits all demographic groups equitably."
