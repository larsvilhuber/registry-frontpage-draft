abstract: "Governments have institutionalized sex education in schools worldwide. While a growing body of evidence exists on sex education messages that can reduce risky sex, little is known about the messenger. We estimate the effect of sex education in Botswana in a large-scale randomized trial that varied both the message and the messenger: teachers, who deliver sex education in the status quo, and near-peers, who are young and aspirational figures. These results are noteworthy in a context where risky sexual behavior is highly consequential, with an average HIV rate of 25 percent. More generally, these results demonstrate the role of messengers in influencing both beliefs and behavior."
