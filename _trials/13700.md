abstract: "Structural models of congestion explicitly model travelers’ choice of when to travel. These models show that the key parameter determining the social cost of congestion is not the commonly estimated value of time, but rather travelers’ schedule flexibility: a measure of how costly it is for them to arrive earlier or later than desired. Despite the central importance of travelers’ schedule flexibility, there are surprisingly few attempts to estimate it. This is one of the first studies that uses survey data on traveler flexibility. Prior studies have simulated possible gains in terms of time using ZIP codes (workplace and home) as well as departure times, ignoring constraints outside traffic that affect commuting behavior.  

We contribute to the existing literature by estimating travelers' schedule flexibility using survey data. We measure commuters' willingness to arrive earlier or later than their current arrival time by quantifying this flexibility in terms of both monetary values and time savings. We use two different elicitation formats - open-ended questions and multiple price lists. In addition, we provide insights into the actual time-saving potential of commuters and the factors that influence their commuting behavior. We ask about commuters' opportunities to work flexibly, their preferred morning start times, their efforts to minimize commuting time, and their reasons for not adjusting their departure times despite potential time savings."
