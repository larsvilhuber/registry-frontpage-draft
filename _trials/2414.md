abstract: "This study investigates the causal relationship between export led manufacturing jobs on married women's fertility choices using a randomized controlled trial design. In this study, eligible job applicants in light manufacturing industries in Ethiopia are randomized to either receive a job offer at the factory they apply to (treatment), or a rejection (control). By following the sample applicants over time, we measure the causal effects of a job on fertility decisions. The insights from this study may be important for policy makers when designing policies to promote women empowerment and gender equality, or when trying to control population growth.  "
