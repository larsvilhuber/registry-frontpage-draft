abstract: "In the field of education economics, recent research has concentrated on school quality and teacher effectiveness, this study pivots attention to the utilization of class time, aiming to empirically assess how in-class breaks may impact student cognitive engagement and, consequently, their attendance, satisfaction, and performance in a higher education context. Employing a randomized controlled trial, we will enroll approximately 400 to 500 students from the Principles of Microeconomics courses at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a structured in-class break of 5-8 minutes. The primary outcomes will be evaluated through final exam scores, attendance records, and student questionnaires developed to measure course satisfaction levels. This research aims to contribute to the current literature by exploring a relatively uncharted area of classroom management, potentially highlighting an additional tool for educators to foster a more conducive learning environment."
