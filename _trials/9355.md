abstract: "We investigate how prices adjust when markets are in disequilibrium by comparing two models of price dynamics: the classic excess supply model developed by Leon Walras, and the excess rent model developed by Vernon Smith. Past investigations exploring how prices adjust rely upon naturally-occurring variation in the treatment variable (prevailing price) as opposed to experimental control via randomization. We explore price dynamics using laboratory experiments wherein we control the assignment mechanism of the key treatment variable and across two distinct market institutions, double oral auctions and decentralized bilateral bargaining"
