abstract: "Charitable fundraisers frequently announce giving by others, and research shows that this can increase donations. However, this mechanism may not put information about peers to the most efficient use if it is costly to inform individuals who are indifferent to peer actions or if it causes some individuals to give less. We investigate heterogeneity in charitable responses to peer decisions, testing whether a fundraiser can identify donor types. To do so, we run a pair of online surveys in which a panel of subjects can donate some of their earnings. The baseline solicitation contains a simple elicitation of beliefs and contingent preferences. We use these responses to describe heterogeneity in the effects of information-about-peers treatments that we randomly assign in the second solicitation."
