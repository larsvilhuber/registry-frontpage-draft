abstract: "Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) has been linked to low productivity in adults, slowing of cognitive and physical growth among children and, in the elderly, increased risk of cognitive impairment and physical disability, as well as decreased muscle strength. 

Distributing iron supplements appears to be an impractical policy in resource-poor settings where the public health systems do not have the capacity to maintain a large-scale distribution system. Iron supplementation of foods is therefore an attractive alternative: it requires no additional effort on the part of the consumer, and can be done relatively cheaply in centralized locations. While NIN's Iron (and Iodine) Fortified Salt (DFS) has been studied extensively by the National Institute of Nutrition (Hyderabad) and others for safety and efficacy in humans, willingness to pay for this new technology has not been established. 

Stores in 200 villages have been stocked with DFS as a part of a larger experiment.

In this experiment, we distribute vouchers to 15 sample households in each of 150 randomly assigned villages (voucher is a flyer mentioning that Double Fortified Salt is available at a discounted price for limited time at stores in their village) in order to estimate the impact of information given directly to households on DFS take-up.  The remaining 50 villages are assigned to the control condition.
