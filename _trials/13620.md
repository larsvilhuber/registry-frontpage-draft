abstract: "Multinational companies (MNCs) are increasingly implementing social initiatives that aim to improve the health and wellbeing of production workers in their supply chains. Yet, there is limited rigorous evidence on their effectiveness. We collaborate with a large MNC in the apparel sector to conduct a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT),  to study the effects of one such program on outcomes among women employed in Indian factories that are in the MNC's supply chain. This study will evaluate the program's impact on behavioural outcomes, particularly attrition. Additionally, we will investigate the program's effects on self-reported outcomes such as health literacy, health status, and embeddedness in the factory."
