abstract: "Agricultural innovation is considered as an important factor in the development of agricultural activities. Fertilizer plays a critical role to improve agricultural productivity. However, the overuse of chemical fertilizer causes groundwater contamination, soil acidification and increase in greenhouse gases. Bio-compost is a type of organic fertilizer using microorganisms to break down organic and inorganic substances, which enriches soil quality and reduces environmental pollution. Nevertheless, the usage of organic fertilizer in general and the usage of bio-compost, in particular, are still low. This study aims to evaluate the impact of subsidy and information on the usage of bio-compost among tea farmers. "
