abstract: "We conduct an online experiment on individual and group decision-making with correlated signals. In every
round, either one decision-maker individually or three decision makers collectively make a decision
under uncertainty that can be right or wrong. Our experiment follows a 2 (group or individual) x 2 (with or without bias) x 2 (with or without correlation) between-subjects design. 
Depending on the treatment, we expect different success probabilities and communication patterns."
