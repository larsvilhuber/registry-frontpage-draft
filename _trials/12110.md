abstract: "We consider a principal-agent model under moral hazard and examine, theoretically, and empirically, the psychological and social motivations of the agent. In particular we examine the effect of such motivations on the incentive compatibility condition (ICC) of the agent. We show that even when the ICC is violated in the classical analysis, if firm culture and social norms are effective, then the worker will prefer to exert high effort levels. If this is the case, then the classical analysis overstates the informational rents to workers, as well as the nature of the moral hazard problem."
