abstract: "The Italian Social Security Institute (INPS) has estimated that only one fourth of the one million children with disabilities living in Italy are receiving cash transfers specifically designed for them. As in other countries, in the absence of specific studies on this subject, one can speculate that the causes of the low take up rate are mainly related to the direct and indirect costs to families to obtain the transfer, which include a long, burdensome, path of medical visits to certify the disability. To cut these costs and try to increase the take up rate, INPS has recently signed a protocol with three of the largest pediatric hospitals in the country, which are able to supply care for a large range of disabilities. The goal of the agreement is to reduce the burden to households by allowing hospital medical staff to use the “Pediatric Specialist Certificate”. The Certificate will allow families to obtain the necessary certification with just one visit. The aim of the study is to understand whether the Certificate is really able to increase the take up rate and reduce direct and indirect costs to households, or other obstacles must be removed before transfers are really effective for a larger set of potential recipients."
