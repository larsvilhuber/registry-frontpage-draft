abstract: "The aim of this project is to investigate whether, why and under what conditions self-regulation - in terms of improvements of hygienic standards and health hazards - might take place among street-food vendors in urban India. The project is being conducted in Kolkata and it will be based on a RCT with about 930 street-food vendors. . Vendors will be eligible to attend a training program aimed at building their capacity to make such improvements. At the end of the training, vendors will be allocated to different treatments to test which incentives drive self-regulatory behaviours."
