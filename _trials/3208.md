abstract: "This study explores whether advice and leadership is more effective when by provided by men versus women. We additionally explore whether the language used in the provision of advice, and whether the outcome is based on group versus individual choices, changes how subjects respond to male and female leadership. We additionally estimate whether our treatment effects differ from subjects' and experts' priors. "
