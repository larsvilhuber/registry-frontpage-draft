abstract: "Although EdTech is rapidly expanding in developing countries little is known about its marginal productivity. Based on a large field experiment we will provide the first test in the literature of whether the educational production function is concave, convex or linear in computer assisted learning (CAL). Results are fundamental to understanding optimal investments in technology-based education. We will use two treatment arms with different levels of time on CAL and a pure control group to estimate effects on student achievement. We will also examine cost-effectiveness and whether different types of students face different production functions. Using two treatment intensities will also allow us to avoid the potential problem of choosing a treatment intensity that is too low or too high, and thus might provide a misleading evaluation of the effectiveness of CAL. Theory and the newness of EdTech in developing countries provide almost no guidance on optimal levels of investment. "
