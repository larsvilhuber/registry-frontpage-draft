abstract: "We conducted a field experiment to investigate the effects of partisan news on the 2016 Taiwan Presidential and Legislative Elections. Subjects are randomly divided into four groups: KMT the ruling party, DPP, the opposition party, the new third-party and control, and provided them with distinct partisan news articles. We find that the pro DPP news articles have significantly increased the support for the DPP candidate Tsai by reinforcing the existing preferences. Pro third-parties articles have changed subjects' voting intentions to support the new party GSD. We also find that the estimated baseline and reinforcement treatment effects are driven by undecided subjects."
