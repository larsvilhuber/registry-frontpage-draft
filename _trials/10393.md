abstract: "Financial inclusion is the availability of financial resources, including transactions, payments, savings, credit and insurance, and equal opportunities to access these financial services. However, despite the growing usage of digital payments, many people in India continue to prefer cash-based transactions due to various factors, one of which is likely the low confidence level in navigating the payment apps or the smartphone itself. Here, in a lab-in-the-field experiment, we plan to test simple video interventions targeted at smartphone users to perform a QR code transaction. They are asked to practise the transaction while watching the video to learn the task step-by-step.
