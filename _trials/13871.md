abstract: "We plan to identify effects of randomly assigned settlement discount offers made to delinquent consumer borrowers by a large digital fintech lender in India. The lender will randomly assign late borrowers in its portfolio to offers to settle their outstanding loan amount (inclusive of principal, interest, and other charges) with a single lump sum payment. Offers will vary in the amount of discount (i.e., haircut) on the contractually obligated amount. Estimates will help shed light on the importance of borrowersâ€™ strategic behavior and perceived costs of defaulting."
