abstract: "We investigate the effect of Artificial Intelligence as a source of help for the leader of a group that is facing a coordination dilemma. In an on-line experiment, subjects play a one-shot minimum effort game with leadership. The group leader must send a short message to their teammates to enhance coordination. First, the leader writes the message, then they see ChatGPT's output for the same task and decide whether to send their own text or the one produced by the chatbot. Followers are informed whether the leader sent their own message or the one produced by ChatGPT, before making their decision. With this approach, we want to compare the differences in coordination levels and elicited beliefs between the groups with a human-written leader's message and those with an AI-generated one."
