abstract: "This research evaluates two programs, entrepreneurship and vocational trainings, implemented by Employment Fund (EF) across 30 districts of Nepal in early 2014. The vocational training program is unusual in two respects: a) training providers are paid more if the trainees are employed; and b) it is offered only to extremely poor individuals. The entrepreneurship program also has the incentive feature, but does not explicitly target extremely poor individuals. The impact of the programs is estimated by comparing individuals in treatment and control groups who are randomly assigned to those groups from a pool of program applicants.  The research design also allows one to estimate the ‘selection effect’ of training institutes by comparing treatment groups generated through randomly selected applicants with the treatment groups selected by the training institutes."
