abstract: "We study whether providing information to school principals on previous exam performance of their school and asking them to coordinate with the schoolâ€™s leadership team in the design and implementation of teacher and parental workshops can improve the school's performance and parental involvement in subsequent examinations. A subset of private and public school principals in the Dominican Republic that had previously administered national exams receive feedback on the school's previous performance and are asked to coordinate with the leadership team, their teachers, and parent organizations to elaborate a plan to improve test scores. Although all schools in our sample receive information about the campaign, we randomly vary both the intensity and content of a reminder campaign for school principals to test whether selective information diffusion improves school performance."
