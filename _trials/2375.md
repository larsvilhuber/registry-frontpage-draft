abstract: "My research considers how incumbent politicians are viewed by the community as playing a critical role in providing cash to the citizens for expenses that they cannot afford and in contributing to local public goods initiatives. It suggests that although voters dislike corruption and value public goods provision, voters also tend evaluate candidate performance on the basis of observed cash transfers to individuals and to the community. This study has a series of survey, list, and behavioral experiments to test the efficacy of different campaign promises, the extent to which politician charity and corruption impacts voter evaluations of candidates, how poverty can increase voter expectations of cash, and how pessimism about corruption can undermine citizen valuations of public goods.
