abstract: "Voluntary worker to worker helping behavior -i.e., worker cooperation- is very important for the performance of any organization. There is a vast theoretical literature in the fields of evolutionary biology and evolutionary anthropology regarding the conditions and mechanisms that favor the evolution of cooperation in populations. However, extant empirical evidence comes mainly from the lab, with scant evidence coming from the field. 
In this project, we collaborate with three organizations in order to experimentally intervene the implementation of a workplace safety methodology that is based on voluntary cooperation by workers. In this prevention methodology, a starting group of ten workers is voluntarily created which then is trained to provide structured feedback on safety behavior to fellow workers in the site (in our case, the sites have approximately 250 workers). Then, this group strives to expand within the site, inviting and training workers to become feedback providers themselves. Becoming an observer and executing observations is a voluntary cooperative act: it is freely chosen, it is costly and most of the benefits are accrued by fellow co-workers that receive the feedback. As expected,  the incentive to cooperate decreases as the number of observers grow, limiting the evolution of cooperation.
We designed three treatments that attempt to ameliorate the problem of cooperation in large groups. We implement these treatments in four sites:
Treatment 1. In each of the four sites, we created a structure of five groups where one tenth of the employees were randomly assigned to five randomly selected observers. The selected observers, as well as the enrolled ones, will be bound to execute their observations within the assigned group. 
Treatment 2. In the sites 2 and 4, we allowed the observers in these groups to meet regularly and to interact with originals ten observers of the site.
Treatment 3. In the sites 3 and 4, we will publish a monthly list of the amount of observations executed by all the observers in the site.
