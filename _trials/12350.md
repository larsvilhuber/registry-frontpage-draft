abstract: "Can exposing women to role models improve their participation in community decision-making and their perceived voice and agency beyond the household? And can additionally providing skills training on identifying policy priorities, setting goals, and speaking in public bolster any effects? We consider these research questions in the eastern Indian state of Odisha in the context of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) program, in which citizens are invited to request individual and community assets to be constructed by the program via a participatory process. Across 94 communities in 4 districts, we will gather 1400 groups of 4--6 women each. We have three study arms. All groups will receive an  information leaflet containing details on the formal processes for demanding assets under  MGNREGA. In the placebo group, women will then watch a 15-minute video unrelated to our study and discuss the video with their group. Treatment group 1 (T1) will receive an aspirations treatment; women will watch a 15-20-minute inspirational video about how women in Odisha have successfully participated in MGNREGA asset selection and discuss the video with their group. Treatment group 2 (T2) will receive T1 plus an additional approximately 1.5 hour skills training; specifically, they will receive a new training curriculum called "Planning for Voice,'' focused on conferring the skills needed to express demands for MGNREGA assets in community planning processes. This skills training includes opportunities for role play and public speaking practice around asset demands. Importantly, the recruitment script will be the same for all study groups and facilitators will not share any information about the training they are to receive with women before recruiting them. We will analyze the impacts of each of T1 and T2 relative to the placebo as well as the impacts of T2 relative to T1."
