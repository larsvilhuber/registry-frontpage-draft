abstract: "The Bangladesh Initiative to Enhance Nutrition Security and Governance (BIeNGS) project is funded by the European Commission and is a collaboration between World Vision UK (WVUK), World Vision Bangladesh (WVB), World Vision Australia (WVA), the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)  via â€˜HarvestPlus  and  Unnayan  Sangha  (US)  a  local  NGO  in  Bangladesh.  The  Institute  of Development Studies (IDS), UK is a partner and is responsible for this impact evaluation. The BIeNGS model is based on four interrelated components comprising a number of different nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive, pro-poor governance interventions: (1) social and behaviour change communication (SBCC), (2) health system strengthening through social accountability (SA), governance improvements and,   capacity   development,   (3)   productive   and   economic   empowerment,   and   (4)   multisector coordination.

The evaluation consists of a cluster randomised trial to compare the difference between communities receiving  initially  a  core  package  of  activities  (BEINGS-standard)  focused  on  government  health service strengthening, value chain development / economic empowerment, with communities receiving the same package plus the SBCC and SA interventions (BEINGS-intensive). This will be for a 2-year trial period (phase 1), after which the impacts will assessed. In phase 2, for the remaining 2 years of the project, the BEINGs-standard groups will also receive the SBCC and SA interventions. The evaluation team  will  work  with  the  delivery  partners  to ensure  that  phase  2  delivery  can  be  informed  from  the results of the phase 1 evaluation.  A final comparison will then be made of outcomes before and after the  trial  via  an  evaluation endline,  at  the  end  of  the  five-year  period.  The  evaluation  is  measuringa range of outcomes relevant to the project logrframe and the evaluation questions which include changes in  key  indicators  to  do  with  child  nutrition  (anthropometry,  diet  adequacy,  diversity  and  feeding practices);  service  uptake,  quality  and  improvement,governance,  voice  and  participation  of  local community members and broader health.
