abstract: "Nationwide today, there are about three undergraduate men for every one woman who major in economics. The gender disparity is due to many factors but is exacerbated by incomplete information about the application of economics beyond business and finance, a lack of role models and mentors, and the limit on evidence-based material presented in introductory courses. The UWE Challenge is an RCT that will test the effects of deliberate intervention strategies by economics departments at 20 randomly selected institutions to recruit and retain female majors. The experiment will determine whether there are any detectable benefits of this intentional effort by comparing the outcomes at the treatment schools with those at control schools, and by comparing outcomes at treatment schools for entering cohorts before and after treatment."
