abstract: "The main objective of this project is to study how perception of tax compliance affects preferences for the size of the welfare state and for income redistribution. Using a large-scale survey experiment, we test whether giving individuals information about tax evasion reduces their bias on this topic and changes their attitudes towards tax fraud, the support of the welfare state and the desired degree of progressivity of the tax system. In particular, we check if detailed information about the differences in the level tax evasion across individuals with different income alter their preferences.  "
