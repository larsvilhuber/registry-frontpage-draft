abstract: "We are using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the impact on labor market outcomes of the “Tech for Jobs”  program delivered in Jordan by Correlation One, a U.S.-based workforce development organization. The program combines technology skills training, professional development, and job matching and placement services. The training component aims to enhance technology skills related to data science and data analytics, a set of skills well in demand in the ICT sector, which is an area of rapidly growing employment in the region, particularly for youth and women. It also aims to develop accurate information about the qualifications of applicants through assessments the results of which are shared with global IT employers, prepare job seekers to present themselves effectively in this job market through professional development, and provide job matching and placement services to overcome frictions.
