abstract: "Local bureaucrats are crucial for service delivery. In many developing countries, they operate in settings with weak oversight institutions and high levels of information asymmetries, further contributing to suboptimal levels of public services. One important, yet understudied, mechanism to hold them accountable is political oversight. The effects of political oversight over bureaucrats on the quality of service delivery are ambiguous. On the one hand, a growing body of empirical evidence finds that in particular in settings of weak institutions elected officials are often more accountable than their appointed counterparts, suggesting that increased political oversight may have positive effects. On the other hand, the literature points to several reasons why bureaucratic insulation may be beneficial, including pandering and patronage by politicians. My dissertation grapples with this ambiguity theoretically and empirically. Building on delegation theory, I formulate an original theory on the conditions under which we should expect an increase in political oversight to improve the quality of service delivery. I test the derived hypotheses through a field experiment, which I implement in collaboration with the Ugandan Ministry of Finance and ODI in 260 local governments in Uganda, by increasing the de facto oversight local politicians have over their bureaucratic counterparts, and, in a second treatment arm, their electoral incentives to use it to improve service delivery.
