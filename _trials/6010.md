abstract: "The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in an unprecedented media consumption in households, yet this increase in not reflected in additional revenues for newspapers. On the contrary, digital advertising is reported to have decreased. A large problem is related to advertisers using “ad blockers” that effectively prevent their advertisements from be shown next to COVID-related stories. This project will investigate if there are ways to arrest this decline during the crisis. We will conduct an eye-tracking study of a 1000 UK and US participants. The project’s findings would constitute experimental causal evidence regarding whether ads shown next to COVID-related articles harm the advertisers. These findings will help us understand the impact (or lack thereof) of coronavirus on attention to advertising in newsbrands. This may have a dramatic effect on the revenues of one of the communities.  "
