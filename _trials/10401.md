abstract: "How can we detect insincere religious beliefs? Can thought leaders change behavior that is not detectable self-reported answers? We hope to answer these questions, by conducting a field experiment in Pakistan. We combine an objective measure of Ramadan fasting observance and compare it with self-reported intention to fast in Ramadan to examine if conservative and liberal Imams differentially impact actual and intended fasting behavior. We conduct a randomized evaluation in Pakistan where individuals are exposed to conservative and liberal imams who encourage and discourage individuals to fast in Ramadan, respectively by offering a different interpretation of fasting in Ramadan. Specifically, we randomly assign 607 individuals into three treatment arms with 202 assigned the conservative treatment, 202 the liberal treatment and 203 the placebo message. We investigate whether these messaging impact their stated and actual Ramadan fasting behavior.
