abstract: "How do secondary school graduatesâ€™ wage expectations react to different types of new information? In this study, we review the effect of information on the evolution of future earnings expectations. We use a randomised control trial which exposes individuals to different information treatments over the period, based on data collected from prior survey rounds. The RCT is conducted with a large sample of Mozambican secondary school leavers from technical and vocational education institutes who are part of an on-going tracer study as they transition from school to the labour market."
