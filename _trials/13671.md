abstract: "The ECB plans to include owner-occupied housing (OOH) costs in its inflation measure. This paper analyses how household long-run expectations about euro area inflation, interest rates, and OOH inflation would react to this change. Using a survey experiment, we find significantly higher inflation expectations under the treatment where OOH costs are assumed to be fully included in the inflation measure. This
information effect is heterogeneous as, among others, homeowners and respondents with low trust in the ECB react more strongly. However,
additional information about past OOH inflation reverses this increase. Thus, communication strategy is important for stabilizing long-term inflation expectations."
