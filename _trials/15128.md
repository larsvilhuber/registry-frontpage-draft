abstract: "Remittances and transfers are crucial for households in rural Niger, serving as tools for consumption smoothing and risk mitigation in the face of shocks as well as continuous income support. Mobile money, a non-bank digital payment platform, has the potential to reduce transaction costs and increase the security and efficiency of transfers. While there is demand for reliable and affordable money transfer services, the adoption of mobile money in Niger remains low. We assess the impact of different incentive schemes on the adoption and sustainable usage of mobile money with an experimental design. We also examine the causal impact of mobile money adoption on household welfare. We hypothesize that the incentives will not only increase the adoption of mobile money but also enhance households’ understanding of and demand for the service. The ease and security of mobile money transfers may increase remittances and migration. Ultimately, these changes are expected to strengthen households’ capacity to cope with risks and improve their overall welfare.
