abstract: "This online experiment examines the influence of payment modalities on productivity when working under framed incentive contracts. We investigate the effect of payment visualization to make the payment situation more salient to the participants. We employ a 2x2 design with four different treatments varying the incentive contract (bonus vs. penalty) and the visualization (visualized dollar bills vs. description only). Participants work on 15 real effort tasks. At the end, one task is randomly selected for payment. If the selected task is solved correctly, participants in the bonus treatment receive an additional payment. In the penalty treatment, participants receive a higher payment upfront, but can lose part of it, if the selected task is solved incorrectly. Both contracts are payoff-equivalent. We vary whether the payment options are visualized on screen with dollar bills while participants work on the task, or are only explained using a verbal description."
