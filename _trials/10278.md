abstract: "While mobile phones are increasingly widespread in Sub Saharan Africa, there remains no accompanying service like the Yellow Pages that allows phone users to find new mobile numbers at low cost. This study will test the impacts of reducing the cost of search for information by providing farmers a directory with the contact information of businesses in the Kagera region of Northwestern Tanzania. The study will test the differential impacts of a digital phone-based versus a paper-based directory, and will test for heterogeneous effects based on baseline networks. The primary outcomes relate to phone usage, search behavior, investment, prices, income-generating activities, and various measures of extra-village contact and trade over space."
