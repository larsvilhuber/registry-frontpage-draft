abstract: "We are undertaking a randomised controlled trial of a Reading Catch-Up Programme amongst fourth grade pupils in South Africa.   The study will evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of an eleven week programme which focuses on improving the performance of fourth grade students in English, which is the second language for the majority of targeted students. The study will be conducted in the Pinetown district of KwaZulu-Natal Province in South Africa.

As is the case for the majority of students in South Africa, those in the targeted schools experience a transition in the language of instruction at the fourth grade.  In grades 1 through 3 most schools teach in the Home Language of students (isiZulu in the case of Pinetown) and then transition to English as language of instruction in grade 4.  Research has demonstrated that most South African children in poor communities have accumulated large learning deficits in English proficiency by the fourth grade (Taylor, 2011).

The intervention consists of three components: scripted lesson plans, additional reading resources and in-class instructional coaching and training.  The study randomly assigned 40 schools to the treatment group and 60 schools to the control group.  Baseline testing was conducted between the 8th of April and the 18th of April 2014.  Follow-up testing will be administered between the 17th of June and the 27th of June 2014.  This study has the potential to contribute significant policy insights with regard to the value and efficacy of large-scale remediation strategies in the public school sector.
