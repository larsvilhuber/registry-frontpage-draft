abstract: "Ample empirical evidence suggest that individuals are averse to inequality (Charité et al., 2015). This suggest that individuals would be willing to act to promote equality in income distribution. Yet, inequality is persistent across the world (World Bank, 2015). 
The hypothesis that we explore in this research is that loss aversion and reference-dependent utility limits redistribution. We consider two factors that limit redistribution: aversion to rank reversal and last rank aversion."
