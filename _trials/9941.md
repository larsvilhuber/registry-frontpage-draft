abstract: "We design a large-scale survey that includes an information-treatment experiment to assess a representative populationâ€™s views about alternative schemes to finance climate change policies and the economic mechanisms that explain such views. We provide randomized information about which groups contribute more to or benefit from climate change. We then study how these different types of information affect the preferences for five alternative schemes to finance climate change policies.
