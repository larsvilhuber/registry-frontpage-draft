abstract: "Slow government service delivery and low accountability among government bureaucrats are common problems in many low- and middle-income countries. As eGovernance systems are becoming common practice in government service delivery in Bangladesh, more and more data is generated regarding about how bureaucrats are providing government services but so far very little of data is used by the government to improve service delivery. In this project we will use the data generated by one eGovernance system to generate a monthly Performance Scorecard for government bureaucrats in terms of the timeliness of their service provision. The service for which we will implement this intervention is land record changes, also know as “mutations”. We will be sending out performance scorecards displaying how many applications for mutations were processed within the government mandated time limit of 45 working days as well as how many applications that are still pending beyond this limit. By sending these performance scorecards to both the bureaucrats doing the land record changes, as well as the superiors of these bureaucrats we hope to improve accountability within the bureaucracy and thereby increasing the number of government services provided within the time limit."
