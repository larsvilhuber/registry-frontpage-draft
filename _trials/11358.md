abstract: "Emotions have a significant impact on decision-making. Understanding the impact of emotions on investment decision-making is crucial, particularly when predicting investment outcomes, due to the rising popularity and competitiveness of crowdfunding campaigns. This research aims to explore the role of emotions in investment decisions with regard to the cause-effect mechanism and correlation between emotions of the investor and investment decisions in crowdfunding campaigns. The study will focus on reward-based and equity-based crowdfunding, the most impactful forms of crowdfunding. Additionally, the study aims to investigate if individuals with investment knowledge make less emotional and more fact-based investment decisions than individuals without investment knowledge. The study's results will offer valuable insights into the role of emotions in investment decision-making, enhancing a better understanding of the crowdfunding process for investors, capital seekers, and platform providers, and also paving the way for further research in the area of marketing that explores the potential of emotion knowledge to improve product presentation and increase success rates.
The role of emotions in decision-making is gaining importance in the field of investment science and entrepreneurial finance, and its impact on investment decisions in crowdfunding is a new area that needs exploration. The first research question aims to explore the influence of emotions on the investment decisions of private investors in crowdfunding campaigns and whether emotions can predict investment decisions. As reward-based and equity-based crowdfunding are the most impactful forms of crowdfunding a second research question will examine the extent to which emotions affect the investment decision of private investors differently. The third research question shall investigate whether people with investment knowledge make less emotional and more fact-based investment decisions than people without investment knowledge. The research aims to reduce the research gap in the behavior of retail investors in the investment decision-making process.
