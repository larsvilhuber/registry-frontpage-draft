abstract: "Anemia is the most common form of malnutrition, affecting approximately 1.6 billion people world-wide. Most commonly caused by iron deficiency, its adverse effects include increased mortality (especially during childbirth), impaired cognitive development among children, chronic fatigue, and reduced lifetime earnings. While iron deficiency is the main cause of anemia worldwide, its etiology is complex and it can also be caused by an insufficient intake of other micronutrients such as Vitamin A, B9, B12 and folate as well as by helminthic infections and malaria.  

Research in India and elsewhere has shown that under ideal (controlled) conditions, anemia can be reduced by consumption of iron-fortified food and other micro-nutrients. However, much less is known about the effectiveness of such interventions under actual program conditions on a large scale. This trial proposes to address anemia and other micronutrient deficiencies by providing micronutrient fortified rice through the Public Distribution System (PDS) of Tamil Nadu in a manner that requires no change in behaviour by end-user households and that can feasibly be conducted on a large scale. 

This trial is designed as a rigorous cluster-randomized controlled trial with the full collaboration of the government of Tamil Nadu.  The trial will follow a randomized cluster design at the Fair Price Shops (FPS) which distribute rice in the Tamil Nadu PDS.  Fair Price Shops will be assigned randomly either to the treatment or the control arm, and will either be provided fortified rice for distribution, or the standard, non-fortified rice.
