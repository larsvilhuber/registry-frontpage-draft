abstract: "We exploit random assignment of gender quotas for leadership positions across Indian village
councils to show that prior exposure to a female leader is associated with electoral gains for
women. After ten years of quotas, women are more likely to stand for, and win, elected positions
in councils required to have a female chief councilor in the previous two elections. We provide
experimental and survey evidence on one channel of influence - changes in voter attitudes. Prior
exposure to a female chief councilor improves perceptions of female leader effectiveness and
weakens stereotypes about gender roles in public and domestic spheres."
