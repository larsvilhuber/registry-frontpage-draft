abstract: "We study customer picking behavior when purchasing perishable products. We investigate the effects of a sustainability message and pricing, as well as the interaction between these two aspects. In online experiments, subjects can choose between items that differ in expiration date and/or price. In the treatment group, subjects receive a sustainability message. "
