abstract: "Parents commonly seek the best possible school for their children. In countries where students are assigned schools based on their place of residence, economic literature shows that the presence of better schools in a district is reflected in increased property prices and higher prices for renting appartements. Most economic studies focus on school performance as the primary measure of quality driving these premiums. While an emerging literature looks at additional school attributes, such as the share of students eligible for free school meals, little is known about preferences for student composition. We contribute to this literature by investigating parents' willingness to pay for a certain pupil composition in addition to school performance. Specifically, we assess parental preferences for the share of foreign students, the share of students with special needs, and school performance. Using a discrete choice experiment with 2,000 Swiss parents of school-age children, we assess their preferences by having them choose between various school options."
