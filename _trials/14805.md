abstract: "Students in the transition to higher education (HE) face particular challenges, resulting in e.g. unnecessary dropout from their studies. Institutions therefore develop interventions to improve student well-being, sense of belonging, and academic engagement. Effects of such interventions are promising but not always investigated rigorously. This study aims to deepen our understanding of the impact of short curricular training. A (quasi)-experimental design including control groups is used to compare the impact of three training versions, respectively aimed at well-being, metacognitive and behavioral academic engagement or sense of belonging. These trainings do so by teaching self-regulation skills or professional social skills. The sample includes two, hopefully three, cohorts (maximum ~2700 students) from the Faculty of Law at a European university, with relatively high first-year dropout rates (~30%). The first cohort and 25% of the second cohort served as a control group and did not receive training. Selected study programs constituting 75% of students in the second (and hopefully third) cohort receive a 2-hour in-class training in the autumn. Three training versions are randomly assigned to student groups. Measured outcomes are studentsâ€™ self-reported beliefs and behaviors on respective training aims, as well as academic performance. All outcomes are controlled for with a pre-measurement. We also explore how student characteristics predict difficulties in the transition to higher education, and whether students benefit differently from such trainings.  Final results will help inform HE institutions on optimizing strategic support for first-year students."
