Most research on population and environment nexus concentrates on population growth and carbon dioxide emissions. Little research considers population density, and how it interacts with carbon dioxide emissions within a relationship. Thus, this research investigates the net impact of population density on carbon dioxide emissions across African countries and sees how this impact varies with per capita income. First, a conceptual framework of the structure of a relationship between population density, final consumption expenditure (annual growth), manufacturing sector and services sector value added as a component of GDP are synthesized from the IPAT to the STIRPAT model literature into an augmented STIRDCMS model. A panel equation modelling techniques were used to analyze the data. The empirical findings provided support for the conceptual framework, the findings suggest that the average effect of population density over CO2 emissions, when the population density change across time and between countries in LICA, increases by 1%, CO2 emissions increase by about 0.196% and reduce CO2 emissions by about 0.19% and 0.22% for LIMCA UICA respectively, holding all other predictors constant. An implication for both future researchers and decision makers are that this would expectedly heighten the awareness of the policy makers and the general public to equip a counterattack to possible severe environmental impacts in LICA. To the future researchers, this study can provide baseline information on the recent status of population density-CO2 emissions relationship. Furthermore, this study would be beneficial to the literature. It would provide the necessary information on the different driving forces of the environmental impacts in Africa.
