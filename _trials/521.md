abstract: "In the dairy market in Kenya, the same farmer often sell to small traders alongside a larger, more established player, typically a Cooperative. These two marketing channels are radically different from the point of view of the farmers: small traders pay prices higher than the larger buyers and pay farmers in cash (rather than through consolidated transfers at the end of the month). We work in partnership with a large dairy cooperative in Kenya and propose a set of experiments to understand how interlinked transactions explain this prevailing market structure.

Using a comprehensive baseline survey, we hypothesize farmers face saving constraints and have a demand for deferred and bulky payments. Only large organizations, with enough reputation, can provide saving service through deferred payments. On the other hand, farmers do not trust small traders to hold their money. We propose several experiments to test this hypothesis.

We offer selected members of the coop the option to be paid more frequently than the coop currently does. In a first treatment, we ask farmers to chose whether they want to be paid daily for their milk deliveries to the coop - as opposed to continue being paid monthly as the coop currently does. We offer a price increase to those farmers that switch.

In a second treatment, we offer farmers the choice between continue being paid monthly versus having the flexibility to chose, every day, whether they prefer their deliveries to be paid in cash or at the end of the month. In both cases, we increase prices paid for a subset of their deliveries deliveries. 

In a third experiment in which farmers are assigned to a short-run bonus for a subset of their milk deliveries with either monthly or flexible payments (as in the second choice experiment described above) for short periods of three days each. 

We also hypothesize that farmers adopt a rule of thumb rule where they use their morning milk for savings and their afternoon milk for liquidity and consumption. In order to test with hypothesis, we plan to elicit preferences for monthly vs. daily payments for morning and afternoon.

Finally, we conduce lab-in-the-field experiments to test whether buyer credibility affects farmers' preferences for daily/monthly payments. We also test whether buyer's saving constraints matter.

The main outcomes of interest are take-up of more frequent/flexible payments in the choice experiments, intertemporal choices in the am vs. pm, and milk deliveries to the coop in the bonus experiment."
