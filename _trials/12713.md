abstract: "We conduct a series of dynamic public goods games in two locations, Ghana and the United States, to measure how unconditional cooperation (i.e. generosity) may crowd in cooperation. The key experimental intervention is that in half of the treatments, one participant in the four-player groups, employs an unconditional cooperation strategy, giving all of their endowment to the public good regardless of the behavior of their group members. By experimentally imposing this unconditional cooperation strategy, we are able to determine if such cooperative behavior crowds in cooperation from other group members. An additional treatment introduces inequality of initial endowments to explore whether the impact of unconditional cooperation differs under inequality. "
