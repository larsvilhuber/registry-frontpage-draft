abstract: "The low take-up of social benefits is one of the major hurdles in designing effective social policies. A proportion of individuals who are entitled to social benefits choose not to claim them. The literature has advanced several possible explanations for this phenomenon: lack of information, transaction costs (such as transport costs), and fear of being stigmatised.

In order to face this problem, the French Welfare Office (CNAF) invites potential beneficiaries to meet with social workers in order to examine their eligibility status with respect to a large range of State and local social benefits. Our project examines the effects of various type of invitations, which address different plausible causes of low take-up, on the presence of people at those meetings and the effect of this presence on the actual take-up of social benefits.  We focus our analysis on a population which is likely to require social benefits: people who recently registered as unemployed or for whom unemployment insurance will soon come to an end.

This experimentation has a double goal: evaluating a program which aims at increasing the level of take-up of social benefits and studying the causes of this low take-up (lack of information, cost of contracting social service and stigmatisation) and their relative weight.
