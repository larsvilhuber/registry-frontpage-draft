abstract: "In this project, we plan to study whether and to what extent individuals in the United States misreport their attitudes towards transgender individuals and sentiments about employment discrimination. When individuals are faced with sensitive questions in surveys, they tend to misreport. This is mainly caused by social desirability bias: respondents lying to direct questions in surveys when they believe that their opinion runs counter to the perceived social norm. We plan to study our research questions by running a list experiment online in Prolific with a representative sample of the U.S. in terms of age, ethnicity, and sex. List experiments provide a “veil” for subjects and allows researchers to make inferences about the true population estimates. By using a list experiment, we will be able to study whether and to what extent individuals in the United States misreport their attitudes towards transgender individuals in the workplace and employment discrimination. The size of the bias is not ex-ante clear: online surveys may elicit truthful answers since they are self-administered, completed in private, and anonymous. Thus, the treatment effects we find may provide a lower bound of the true population effect since most surveys are not conducted with this much privacy and anonymity and thus people may be less prone to social desirability bias."
