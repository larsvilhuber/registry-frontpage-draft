abstract: "The aim of the study is to examine whether providing targeted, timely and behaviourally informed prompts, via SMS, will improve the number of recipients who take a desired action in a timely manner.  

During the discovery phase (scoping for the project) it was agreed that Job Seeker (Newstart and Youth Allowance) recipients in receipt of income support payments, administered by the Australian Department of Human Services, were a population of interest. These recipients are required to report each fortnight, and include any income they receive from employment.   

Late reporters may have their payments terminated, which can be problematic for the client and increase departmental work in the form of increased contacts and reinstating customers back onto payments. 
This trial will have seven arms and will scientifically test behaviour against some key behavioural concepts such as personalisation and loss and gain framed messages.

It is anticipated findings from this research will inform service delivery both within the lead department and across the Australian Public Service.
