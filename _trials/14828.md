abstract: "Data on school-related violence currently focuses on children above 12 years old and we lack knowledge on which data collection methods can ensure accurate and safe reporting. To address this issue, we are conducting a survey experiment with four treatment arms to determine which survey modes and interview locations elicit more reliable disclosures of school-related violence. The study targets children aged 8 to 12 and examines their experiences with bullying, corporal punishment, and sexual violence."
