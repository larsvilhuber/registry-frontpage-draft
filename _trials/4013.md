abstract: "We will be conducting a randomized controlled trial on the Rapid Youth Success Entrepreneurship Program (RYSE).

The RYSE Program is a research and social outreach project that aims to improve youth unemployment rates by equipping low-income individuals aged 18-24 who currently enrolled at polytechnic institutions in Malaysia with the skills to plan, design, and run their own business or startup from scratch. The RYSE Program builds on ASB and MIT’s strengths in entrepreneurship and innovation as well as relying on the experience of local partners and successful entrepreneurs in Malaysia. The RYSE Program takes in uninitiated participants from “zero” to “entrepreneur”. This intensive (hence “rapid” program), will be held at 4 polytechnics in Klang Valley (i.e. Central Region) involving 420 participants for just over 6 months from mid March-December 2019."
