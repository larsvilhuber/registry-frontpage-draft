abstract: "Investors have the irrational disposition to sell assets that have gained value too early and keep assets that have lost value too long. This well documented disposition effect (Shefrin & Statman 1985) plays a prominent role in the behavioral finance- and in the behavioral economics literature (Andreassen 1988; Weber & Camerer 1998; Gneezy 2005). The aim of this project is to investigate the relative importance of three potential drivers of the disposition effect (risk attitudes, ambiguity attitudes, beliefs) and to compare finance professionals with non-professionals in a controlled experiment."
