abstract: "To reduce the spread of Covid-19, school closures and other measures limiting in-person teaching and peer interactions were implemented almost universally worldwide. These measures have large potential to aggravate studentsâ€™ educational performance, in particular for those from low socio-economic backgrounds or already low performing students. To mitigate the negative effects of Covid-19 on student performance, governments provided large financial resources to implement tutoring for students. However, little is known about the take-up and the effectiveness of such programs. This study investigates the effectiveness of a one-to-one online tutoring program targeting low performing school students. University students deliver the free of charge tutorials. We first analyze the effect of tutorial invitations on the take-up. We proceed to study its effects on student performance, learning activities, and labor market transition."
