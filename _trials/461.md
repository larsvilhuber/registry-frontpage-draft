abstract: "In developing countries, residential access to modern energy and lighting improves living standards and productivity (World Bank, 2006).  Yet due to electricity constraints, blackouts and high prices are not uncommon.  Because lighting is a major component of electricity consumption, energy efficient technologies such as compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) can reduce electricity demand and help energy-constrained countries to meet conservation goals.  Using a randomized study design, we examine the adoption, utilization, and diffusion of CFLs in Kyrgyzstan.  We find that energy efficient light bulbs have a significant impact on electricity use, that there is evidence of a rebound in electricity use, and that the behavioral response differs between households that received CFL bulbs for free vs. for a positive price.  Moving forward, we continue to evaluate reasons for these differential responses."
