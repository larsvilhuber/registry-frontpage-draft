abstract: "We work with the Mexico City Labor Court, one of the largest of its kind in Latin America. Like many courts in developing countries, it has long delays, and lower settlement than systems with better rule of law. We design and implement an experiment to address two related obstacles to settlements, misinformation of the plaintiff (worker) and overconfidence of the plaintiff and her lawyer about the probability of recovery and the amount of recovery. The experiment consists of providing statistical information to parties and their lawyers about the results of lawsuits from a large data base of concluded conflicts at the same court. Predictions are based on all observable case characteristics. We also survey parties and their lawyers, especially focusing on measuring expectations and the knowledge of worker's in relation to their claims and the labor law. We confirm high levels of overconfidence and are able to show their relationship to lower settlement rates. The interventions consist of providing the statistical information and then inviting parties to ask to speak with a conciliator, and obliging parties to talk to a conciliator without providing them with any statistical information. The basic results are that the calculator treatment almost doubles the settlement rate on the day of the hearing, and this effect grows very slightly over the next 8 months. The effect is entirely due to cases where the worker herself was present at the hearing, which are only around 20% of the treated cases. "
