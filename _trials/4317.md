abstract: "We experimentally analyze how and why the minimum number of votes required
for a moral transgression (the "voting threshold"') influences the
frequency of votes in favor of it. With simultaneous voting, this frequency
increases in the voting threshold and is thus largest for the unanimity
rule. To identify the underlying motives, we need to account for the fact
that different voting thresholds imply different incentives to free-ride on
the votes of other group members. We do so by considering only pivotal
voters in a sequential setting. We then develop a novel design which allows
us to disentangle several behavioral motives. Our data show that guilt
sharing and preferences for consensual decisions are important and
independent drivers of voting behavior."
