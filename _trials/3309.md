abstract: "We study the causal link between sexual activity and productivity. Our experimental approach induces arousal in subjects’ partners by exposing them to a video with explicit sexual content. Then, we use partners’ arousal as an instrument for subjects’ sexual activity to estimate (via an instrumental variables approach) the causal impact of sexual activity on individual productivity. We also explore the causal link between sexual activity and happiness."
