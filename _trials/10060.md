abstract: "Whether it is a parent deciding on what school district to send their child to, a daughter shopping between assisted living facilities for an elderly parent, or a Medicare patient choosing a primary care physician, citizens face myriad choices and tradeoffs in their interactions with bureaucracy. The once conventional depictions of citizens as passive participants in bureaucratic encounters are being replaced with depictions of citizens as active participants who express agency, preference, and choice. These recent theoretical and empirical developments emphasize that citizens are not monolithic, but rather that individual experiences, sociodemographic identities, and social constructions are all important characteristics that shape how citizens interact with bureaucracy, and who they choose to interact with. This research explores how citizens, when they have a choice, choose bureaucrats and the types of values, choices, and tradeoffs inherent to these decisions. Using a within-subjects conjoint survey experiment, this study examines how citizens weigh representation (e.g. race matching, gender matching) and efficiency (e.g. flexible modality, wait times) concerns when selecting a prospective mental health provider.
