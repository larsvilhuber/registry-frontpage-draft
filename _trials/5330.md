abstract: "In a laboratory experiment, we examine how perceived meaning of work affects participantsâ€™ unethical behavior at work. All participants work on the same real-effort task. In the first treatment, there is no apparent meaning of the task. In the second treatment, meaning is introduced in form of minimal work recognition. Afterwards, participants self-determine their pay-off in private via die-roll with an opportunity to cheat without consequences or other people knowing. Furthermore, this study looks at the relation between produced output and unethical behavior."
