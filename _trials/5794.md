abstract: "Behavioral poverty traps have become a prominent subject of investigation in recent years. Poverty may cause the emergence of certain behavioral traits that in turn prevent people from escaping poverty. In this study, we focus on the causal effect of relative poverty on cooperation, which we measure experimentally in a framed investment game. Cooperation is essential to reap efficiency gains from specialization, not least in poor countries where economic transactions are often informal. Yet, cooperation might be more difficult to sustain under scarcity, since defecting can yield safe, short-run benefits. We leverage variation in relative scarcity induced by the Msimu harvest in rural Tanzania. Before the harvest, farmers face relative scarcity, whereas after the harvest they live in relative abundance. We test whether farmers are less likely to choose the socially efficient but personally risky option in the investment game when they live in relative scarcity. By means of a randomized prime, we further investigate whether this effect is more pronounced when the current economic conditions are made salient. Lastly, we study the effect of scarcity on cooperative behavior with ingroup vs outgroup members.
