abstract: "This pilot study aims to test two competing approaches of front-of-pack labelling for sugar content. We developed an online grocery store containing over 1,800 food and beverages commonly purchased at local supermarkets to test the effects of these labels on consumer choice. This web store was designed to mirror an actual online grocery store in appearance. The study was designed as a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) where consumers were randomized and asked to hypothetically shop in one of three versions of an online grocery store; 1) no FOP label (control), 2) a graphical high-in-sugar label shaped like a stop sign, or 3) a text-based warning label. For the intervention arms (Arms 2 and 3), the labels will be displayed below images of “high-in-sugar” products. A food item is classified as a “high-in-sugar” product if it is among the top 20% of products—within its product category—with the highest sugar percentage (defined as amount of sugar per 100 g). A beverage is classified as a “high-in-sugar” product if it contains at least 10 g per 100 ml (i.e. 10%) of sugar. Given the strongly worded language similar to tobacco warning labels that are used in the text-based health warning label, we hypothesized that the proportion of labelled (or targeted for labelling in Control Arm) products among respondents would be the largest in Control and smallest in the warning label condition (primary outcome). We hypothesized a similar ordering for secondary outcomes, including total sugar purchased, sugar (g) per dollar spent, and total spending. 

The pilot study is a part of the larger project titled: Multiphase Evaluation of Healthier Choice Symbol (HCS) Logo (Project Number: NMRC/HSRG/0060/2016). Following the completion of this pilot study, the procedures and results of the pilot will also be used to refine and develop a larger scale Randomized-Controlled Trial (RCT). "
