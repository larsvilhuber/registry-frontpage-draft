abstract: "This study uses state-of-the-art contingent valuation methods to identify welfare improving government spending reforms. In particular, it identifies on which areas of government activity spending should be increased or decreased from a welfare economic perspective. To this end, we ask the survey participants binary questions if they would agree to a reform that would increase government spending in a specific area and would raise their personal income tax burden by a specific amount. The size of the tax burden is randomized across individuals. This allows us to estimate the distribution of the willingness to pay for increases in government spending. If aggregate willingness to pay exceeds the cost, than an increase in spending is generally welfare improving. "
