abstract: "We examine the role of third-order beliefs in shaping potentially stigmatized public behavior. We hypothesize that information, in addition to its persuasive effects, potentially also affects behavior by providing an "excuse" for engaging in xenophobic actions, leading to changes in equilibrium expression even among people who do not necessarily believe the information. Guided by a theoretical framework, we design an experiment to disentangle the effects of third-order beliefs from those of first- and second-order beliefs in influencing respondents' decisions to donate to an anti-immigrant organization."
