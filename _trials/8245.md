abstract: "We analyze rule enforcement in a setting of approximately 1200 vendors in 22 traditional fresh food markets in Quito, Ecuador. Markets' operations depend on vendors' payments for collective goods such as water supply, electricity, cleaning, and security guard services. However, the payments go through a complex administrative process and depend on vendors' trust and their rule enforcement preferences. Vendors associations' representatives and municipal agents are in charge of enforcement. The project aims to measure whether providing information about the default rate and the payment process has effects on vendors' preferences on rule enforcement.
