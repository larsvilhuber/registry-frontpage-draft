abstract: "In this experiment, we will evaluate the incremental pollination and income (livelihood) benefits of beehives provided to youths in selected districts of Ethiopia. The More Young Entrepreneurs in Silk and Honey (MOYESH) programme, implemented by icipe, is organizing youths in groups, providing training, technical support and beehives to enable the youths to generate income. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the programme on the income of the youths and on the yield of coffee using a clustered Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) design. This study will have one treatment and one control arm.  The treated groups are youths who are randomly assigned to the programme intervention and who receive full programme interventions and the control groups do not receive any intervention. Each arm has 300 enterprises. The primary outcome variable is the income of the youths from honey production and complementary activities and the yield of coffee (ton/ha). The secondary outcome variables are the yield of other pollination-dependent crops around the apiary site and total honey production by the youth enterprises. We will collect baseline, follow up and endline data on enterprise performance indicators, apiary and member characteristics. The data will be analyzed using Analysis of covariance and simple linear regression."
