abstract: "The adoption of green technology in developing countries is essential for sustainable development. However, willingness-to-pay (WTP) for green technology remains low in many of these regions. Traditional WTP assessments do not adequately capture the complexities of credit-based purchases, where payments are distributed over time and agents are time-inconsistent and credit constrained. This project evaluates WTP for credit-based purchases over two dimensions of down payment and repayments, with a focus on affordable clean energy solutions. By understanding how small business owners value credit purchases, we can better design and implement green technology initiatives and subsidy policies targeting similar products and further evaluate the impact of clean-energy product adoption on business performances."
