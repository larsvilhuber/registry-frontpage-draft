abstract: "Interventions by governments, experts, and parents in the lives of others are commonly motivated by a desire to help. What factors influence individuals’ willingness to intervene in the decisions made by others? What factors influence individuals’ attitudes toward paternalistic interventions imposed upon them? We conduct an experiment in a general population sample of the U.S. to address these questions."
