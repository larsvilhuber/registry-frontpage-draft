abstract: "This project is a collaboration with Ivy Tech Community College in Indiana to design a program that will increase rates of community college completion in a scalable and college-sustainable format. Ivy Tech Community College of South Bend-Elkhart will enroll students into a support intervention aimed at helping students navigate the complexity of college and overcome potential barriers to completion. To study the effects of the intervention, participating students will be randomly assigned into one of three groups: an arm offering high-touch services, an arm offering low-touch services, or a control group that has access to the usual college services. This study will use a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the two interventions against each other and against the business as usual condition. The study will enroll 360 students over three years into each intervention treatment arms and an additional 360 students into the control group, for a total of 1,080 study participants. We hypothesize that personalized, ongoing support—high-touch services—are necessary for measurable impact on graduation rates. Outcomes evaluated will include college persistence, degree attainment, and future earnings. The study will also investigate treatment effect heterogeneity across different groups of students and include cost/benefit analyses of the high- and low-touch interventions."
