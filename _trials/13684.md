abstract: "There is growing evidence that the willingness to compete plays a role in determining career choices and labor market outcomes. Most studies use individual choice behavior to measure competitiveness. However, in the work setting there are often opportunities to communicate and coordinate with potential competitors. In this proposed experiment we will introduce two different modes of communication that can be used to dissuade others from competing: (1) cheap talk and (2) a retaliation (destroy) option. We aim to investigate how the possibility of communication affects the coordination of competition choices of pairs of participants and how individuals with different personality traits react differently to the possibility of communication and an option to destroy an opponentâ€™s earnings in the competition.
