abstract: "Combining a randomized controlled trial with bank account and survey data, I show that credit-limit extensions significantly increase consumer expectations about their future income. A one-dollar increase in credit limits raises consumer income expectations over the next six months by 40 cents and total consumption by 34 cents. The expectation changes explain around 35% of the total spending responses to credit limit extensions. The results show that consumers infer information from lenders' credit-supply decisions, and this learning behavior impacts consumers' economic decision-making greatly."
