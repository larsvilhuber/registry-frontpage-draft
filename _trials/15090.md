abstract: "Mindfulness-Based Programs (MBPs), rooted in contemplative practices, have emerged as promising interventions for promoting mental well-being and resilience. Unfortunately, few if any large-scale studies have assessed the efficacy of MBPs for university students in China, a population with a high prevalence of mental health issues. The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of an eight-week mindfulness-based program specifically tailored for university students. We will investigate the effects on mental illness symptoms, stress, student inner resources such as mindfulness, emotion regulation skills, other indicators of well-being such as sleep quality and and academic performance. Additionally, we intend to assess how the impact of the MBP varies when delivered in person or online. The study design will be a three-arm randomized controlled trial with undergraduate students enrolled at different tiers of universities in China.  "
