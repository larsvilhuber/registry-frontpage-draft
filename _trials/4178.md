abstract: "We study social incentives in credit repayment decision of households. We partner with a retail bank in Vietnam and work with a random sample of its credit card customers. Borrowers upon application for credit provide the bank with contact information of their social connections to serve as their references. We randomly assign some customers to have the bank inform the customers' social references in case they do not repay debt on time with the purpose of encouraging their repayment.  First, we test whether social concerns have an effect on incentivizing borrowers to repay their debts? Second, we examine how the effects of social concerns fare to other types of incentives such as monetary reward or credit reputation concerns? Third, we investigate which mechanisms are driving the effects: social stigma or informational role of default? Finally, we test whether social incentives can serve as a (soft) collateral, which we call social collateral. Additionally in this regard, we study to what extend social collateral can substitute physical collateral and the the implications for the borrowers with less physical assets to pledge as collateral such as the unbanked or underbanked, student loans, or the small business owners in cash economies."
