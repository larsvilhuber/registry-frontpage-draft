abstract: "This survey experiment will employ affirmation theory in an attempt to reduce prejudice against ethnic Kurds by ethnic Turks within Turkey. It will also use the same methodology to examine prejudice against Syrian immigrants, another out-group in Turkey, whose numbers have increased due to the civil war in Syria. It is hypothesized that an affirmation exercise will decrease levels of prejudice against both Kurds and Syrians. However, if affirmation is only effective at decreasing prejudice against one of these groups and not the other, the implications would suggest that there are more complex dynamics in the in-group out-group relationships within Turkey."
