abstract: "In this randomised controlled trial study, we will evaluate the impact of two communication-based interventions, delivered remotely, on Complementary Feeding practices in rural India. Our interventions aim to simplify information for caregivers, make complementary feeding a social activity, and integrate relevant nutrition heuristics into communication being given to caregivers. We test for these using two experiments; in the first, our treatment is given simplified counselling over the phone, in our second, we assign mothers into moderated groups on WhatsApp. We deploy our experiments in rural Madhya Pradesh, with a sample of 699 mothers."
