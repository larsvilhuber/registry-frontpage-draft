abstract: "This study focuses on testing approaches of framing information about the impact of indoor wood burning on air quality as well as information about the Smoke Control Area in Sandwell. As of 2024, the borough of Sandwell is now designated as a Smoke Control Area, which imposes restrictions on the type of fuels that can be burned and on types of domestic combustion appliances. The aims of this trial are to: 1) evaluate individuals' baseline knowledge of air quality, the impact of log burning on air quality, and the Smoke Control Area, and 2) assess the impact of delivering information on these topics through health-focused framing and compliance-focused framing.
