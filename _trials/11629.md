abstract: "What are the roles of preferences for and subjective expectations about monetary and nonmonetary factors in determining young people’s occupational choices and the observed gender segregation in the labor market? Does inaccurate information play a role in this? 
We will conduct a study with a sample of young women and men enrolled in vocational training institutes (VTIs) in the districts of Kampala and Wakiso, Uganda. Using hypothetical scenarios, we will elicit VTI course preferences and subjective expectations about monetary and nonmonetary factors. We will then estimate the relative importance of such factors in a model of occupation choice. 
Moreover, we will provide a random half of the study participants with some information about the earnings of an average person in their age range, and test whether receiving this information affects their expectations, and in turn, their preferences.
Finally, we will explore some counterfactuals, which will inform the design of policies to improve women’s labor market outcomes at an early age.
