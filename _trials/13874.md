abstract: "This document describes the research design and analysis strategy of our field experiment, designed around a citizens’ assembly to evaluate the impact of deliberative democracy on preferences for redistribution. The citizens’ assembly, Good Council (“Guter Rat”) takes place in 2024 in Austria. It consists of 50 residents of Austria who are selected to convene and develop ideas for addressing economic inequality, deciding on allocating an endowment of EUR 25 million to purposes conducive to this goal. The Good Council is an example of deliberative democracy, where participants “redistribute” a significant sum donated by a high-net-worth individual. We study whether participation in a citizens’ assembly affects (redistributive) policy preferences and related outcomes of participants. In particular, we are interested in preferences for redistribution and democracy using standard measures. Additionally, our rich questionnaire includes a battery of questions on people’s specific policy views and priorities.
The pre-analysis plan starts with an outline of the treatment and its timeline. We, then, provide a detailed discussion of our study design including data, sample selection, treatment assignment, variables used, and outcomes of interest. Finally, we conclude by specifying our statistical approach to inference."
