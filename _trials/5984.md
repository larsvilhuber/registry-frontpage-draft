abstract: "Building on an experimental analysis of a scheme to engage citizens in volunteering in their local community, this study aims to assess the extent to which the previous experiment has impacted community responses to the COVID crisis.  The hypothesis to be tested is that the pre-existing street-champions scheme laid the foundations for a more intensive community-support response."
