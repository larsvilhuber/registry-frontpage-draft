abstract: "Women apply for jobs that yield relatively lower pay than men (Fluchtmann, Glenny, Harmon, Maibom, 2024). Despite its relevance for the gender wage gap, the mechanisms driving the application gap remain largely underexplored. This study investigates whether gender diﬀerences in overconfidence about one’s relative ability can partially explain this phenomenon.
From a directed search model, we derive two predictions about the role of overconfidence for the gender application gap. First, since overconfident job seekers overestimate their chances of securing high-wage jobs, they have a higher incentive to apply there – the direct eﬀect. Second, job seekers who anticipate others' overconfidence also expect higher competition for high-wage jobs, discouraging them to apply there – the externality of overconfidence. Hence, if men are more overconfident than women, they apply more for high-wage jobs, while women’s anticipation of male overconfidence would further deter them.
To test these eﬀects, we conduct a lab experiment. In part one, participants complete a logic task, followed by the measurement of their overconfidence and second-order beliefs about others' overconfidence. In part two, pairs of participants compete in a stylized labor market where job allocation probabilities depend on their relative performances in the logic task. Pairs are randomized into treatment and control groups: in treatment pairs, one participant is informed about its actual relative performance in the logic task, while the other remains uninformed but knows its competitor has this information. Control group participants receive no performance feedback. This design allows for identifying the direct effect of overconfidence by comparing informed treatment participants to controls, and the externalities of overconfidence by comparing uninformed treatment participants to controls.
