abstract: "How can gender-based violence in the public sphere (GBV) be prevented? Can improved police presence help curb street harassment? What works in improving victimâ€™s engagement with police services? This project aims to answer these questions through a novel policing program in Hyderabad, India. The Safety, Health, and Environment (SHE Teams) Program is a hotspots street police patrolling intervention targeting GBV in public spaces. The researchers and Hyderabad City Police have jointly developed research that aims to test the role of increased police presence through patrolling and policing visibility (i.e., uniformed vs. undercover officers). Our research will address fundamental questions in the economics of crime and gender."
