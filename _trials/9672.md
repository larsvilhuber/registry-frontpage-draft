abstract: "In 2018, students around the world have started to fight for climate protection and protest for environment-friendly policies every Friday. These protests triggered a lot of media attention and are discussed as one of the reasons why public attention towards climate change has increased over the past years. But how do students’ preferences for climate change affect the older generation? In our experimental design, we survey a representative sample of adolescents and their parents in Germany to investigate the intergenerational relationship in preferences for climate protection. For that purpose, we implement a survey experiment in which a randomly selected treatment group of parents is informed about their child’s view that their parents should engage in actions to protect the climate. By comparing responses between the uninformed control group and the informed treatment group, we evaluate whether the child’s stated importance affects parental (i) donations towards a climate-friendly cause, (ii) preferences for policies aiming to protect the climate, and (iii) their private actions for climate protection."
