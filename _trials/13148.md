abstract: "Countries around the world are transitioning away from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources to meet their Net Zero targets. While beneficial for the environment, this transition brings with it an important challenge: it is not (presently) possible to rapidly increase or decrease the generation of solar, wind and water power to meet existing fluctuations in demand. One solution to this problem is to encourage demand flexibility, which refers to the capability, motivation and willingness of consumers to adapt their energy usage in response to the needs of the grid.

Residential consumers (i.e., households), which are responsible for approximately a fourth of global energy consumption, have a large potential for demand flexibility. One way to achieve this potential is through installation of demand response technologies such as smart thermostats. With a smart thermostat installed, residents can enable their utility provider to temporarily adjust their indoor temperature by a few degrees when the demand for energy is at its highest. When this adjustment is done across hundreds or thousands of households, it can considerably alleviate the stress on the grid.

This study will evaluate the impact of behavioral communication on household adoption of smart thermostats and enrollment in a residential demand response program. We will also assess whether enrollment in the program affects household energy consumption, delivering energy flexibility at times when it is needed."
