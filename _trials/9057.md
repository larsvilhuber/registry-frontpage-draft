abstract: "Many studies document that some people ignore information, even though this information would be instrumental for their decision-making. This behavior was often attributed to self-image concerns (Grossmann and VanderWeele 2017). A recent study by Exley and Kessler (2021) however finds that indeed self-image concerns play their role, but a large share of the ignorance behavior is still unexplained. In this study, we will explore whether people instrumentally ignore information to avoid a social dilemma situation. Our design is based on the hidden information game by Dana et al. (2007). To answer our question we reduce the size of the dilemma situation in the experiment."
