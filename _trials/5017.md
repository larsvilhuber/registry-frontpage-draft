abstract: "We design a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to evaluate the impact of a package set-up and implemented by the â€ªUnion Nationale des Producteurs de Soja (UNPS) to improve soybean productivity. We also explore whether choices made by households in terms of who will be the direct beneficiary of the intervention lead to a different outcome/impact than female biased targeting. Our experiment involves two levels of random assignment and three groups. First, we randomly assign eligible villages to either the treatment group or the control group. Second, in each treatment village, we randomly assign eligible households to two groups. In one group, households decide by themselves who between the husband and the wife will be the direct beneficiary of the intervention. In the other group, the wife is imposed as the beneficiary of the intervention."
