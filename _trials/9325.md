abstract: "Entrepreneurial ventures are essential in driving economic growth through the introduction of innovation via new technologies, products, or services. In the key decision-making process of idea generation, entrepreneurs come up with their own theories about market phenomena and business opportunities. In doing so, they leverage on their own endowed domains, the sum of their experiences, knowledge, social and demographic backgrounds, values, beliefs, and tastes, which act as frames of reference.

While there is a growing body of literature arguing that theory framing is essential in strategic and entrepreneurial decision making, no account studies where entrepreneurial theories come from and in which way they evolve from initial domains.

The goal of this project is to understand the implications of acknowledging the existence of domains and their anchoring and constraining effect on entrepreneurial idea generation. We want to understand under which circumstances exploration past endowed domains can be beneficial in terms of key entrepreneurial outcomes such as idea breadth and performance.

To this aim, the project designs and implements an experiment within an already existing randomized control trial (RCT) taking place at ESADE University in Spain (previously pre-registered on AEA under the code AEARCTR-0008945). 

Participants are first randomly allocated to groups for the first intervention (focused on the application of the Scientific Approach to entrepreneurial decision making) and then re-randomized into additional groups for the second intervention (the domain intervention we refer to in this pre-registration)."
