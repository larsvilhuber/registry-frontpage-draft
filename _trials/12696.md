abstract: "This study evaluates the long-run impact of a single course of pharmacotherapy in Karnataka, India.  Angelucci and Bennett (2024) showed that offering pharmacotherapy to depressed adults improved mental health and increased human capital investment in older children. However, the long-term effects of a single course of antidepressants are unknown. We will resurvey the original study participants to evaluate the 7-year impact of this intervention on depression severity, depression awareness and stigma, children's human capital investment, impacts in the household, and possible pathways.
