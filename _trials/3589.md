abstract: "Diabetes is a serious problem worldwide and it is growing rapidly.  We work with a for profit medical institution (Clinicas del Azucar) to test 
 whether their ‘one-stop shop’ model of care delivery to diabetic patients decreases health expenditure and improves health outcomes using an RCT methodology. We estimate heterogeneous effects by whether patients have access to public health insurance. Finally, we estimate predictive models pf patient retention and treatment compliance.
