abstract: "Consumer preferences for fig jams will be elicited in order to estimate WTP values associated with attributes of Short Food Supply Chains (SFSC), namely related to number of intermediaries and distance from the production area. Subjects are recruited from the population of Athens, Greece and participate in a second price auction where they bid to buy 400 gr of a jar of fig jam. Subjects are randomly assigned to one of the following treatments, where we vary on a between-subjects basis the jams available for auction. Subjects bid simultaneously for two of the jams:

Treatment 1: Jam purchased directly from the producer and production area is at a Shorter distance vs. Jam purchased from an intermediary and production area is at a Shorter distance
Treatment 2: Jam purchased directly from the producer and production area is at a Shorter distance vs. Jam purchased directly from the producer and production area is at a Longer distance
Treatment 3: Jam purchased from an intermediary and production area is at a Longer distance vs. Jam purchased from an intermediary and production area is at a Shorter distance
Treatment 4: Jam purchased from an intermediary and production area is at a Longer distance vs. Jam purchased directly from the producer 
and production area is at a Longer distance

Subjects go through three rounds of auctions. In the first round they have no information about the attributes of the jams and they are asked to bid based on appearance only. In Round 2, they receive information about the jams and in Round 3 they get to taste the jams before they bid.

Moreover, to test the effect of anchoring and how it might prevail with time pressure, subjects receive a randomly determined initial bid. They are then given either a short amount of time to adjust their bid or a longer amount of time to adjust it with the understanding that if time expires, the standing bid is the binding bid. Subjects will be randomly assigned to a time limit of 20, 30, 40 or 50 seconds, which will remain constant across all rounds."
