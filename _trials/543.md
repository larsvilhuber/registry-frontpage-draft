abstract: "This project aims at assessing whether there exists racial discrimination in the provision of local public services at the county level in the US. In particular, we will focus on six types of public services that span a broad range of activities provided at the local level. Our design entails us sending emails with queries related to the services provided by the above-mentioned offices. The emails will be signed by names that evoke different race (white or black). We will then gauge whether there are systematic differences in the response to these emails, across senders of different race.
