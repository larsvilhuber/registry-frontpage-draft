abstract: "In this research project we empirically investigate why people choose and hold
strictly dominated pension funds. We discriminate between three main hypotheses:
information asymmetry, search costs, and financial illiteracy. An experiment is
conducted where letters are sent to pension savers in two strictly dominated funds
in the Swedish premium pension system. The treatment letters contain different
types of information in combination with incentivized tasks. Approximately 30 000
people save in the two funds for their premium pension, and we treat about 23 000.
Following the letter treatments we observe the real fund choices by the pension
savers, and test the relative importance of the three hypotheses. By randomizing the
different letters to individuals, we can identify potential causes why people choose to
stay with dominated fund choices. Administrative data on background characteristics
is used to study heterogeneous effects. Furthermore, we estimate distributions of
search costs and implied discount factors. By estimating discount factors across age
we test age dependent attention of the pension investment decision."
