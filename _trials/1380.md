abstract: "A growing body of evidence suggests that parents play a crucial role in shaping their children’s behavior and performance in school. In fact, differences in parental inputs are viewed as an important cause of intergenerational inequality. This paper studies how poverty may impose a psychological tax on parenting, generating a poverty trap even on the absence of binding credit constraints for educational investments. There is reason to think that this may be the case. While low-cost interventions have been shown to significantly increase parental engagement and students’ outcomes, such interventions tend to have significantly lower or no effects among minorities (black families in Chicago, in Fryer, Levitt and List, 2015, and Chinese families in San Francisco, in York and Loeb, 2014). One hypothesis for why that might be comes from the cognitive load/mental bandwidth theory: such parents might have less attention, memory and impulse control available to parenting, because poverty generates cognitive load. To test whether poor parents have a lower propensity to invest in their children due to cognitive load, we resort to survey experiments, priming some parents – but not others – about money, and then presenting them with the opportunity to undertake a costly educational investment in their child. The hypothesis of interest is whether those who are primed undertake such investment to a lesser extent.
