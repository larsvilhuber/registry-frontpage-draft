abstract: "This study examines how diversity-based leadership selection impacts decision-making in a team competition. In a university tournament, students participate in an outdoor throwing game where each player makes eight throws, with points ranging from 0 to 20 per throw. Teams consist of two players: Player 1 (P1) and Player 2 (P2), who serves as the team leader. The team score is initially based on three randomly selected throws from each player, while the remaining five throws are kept as replacements. P2, the leader, is given the opportunity to replace the lowest-scoring throw from either P1 or themselves, using one of the replacement throws. However, P2 does not know the actual points of P1’s remaining throws, only their own. P2 makes these decisions for four hypothetical teammates, each varying by gender and social class, with one randomly chosen match being implemented to determine their final team score. Teams in the top 50% of scores participate in a lottery for prizes.

The primary experimental variation lies in whether P2 is informed about the reason for their leadership selection. In the Info_Class treatment, P2 is told that their role as team leader was assigned to meet a diversity goal of 50-50 representation of high and low socioeconomic status leaders. In the Info_Gender treatment, the diversity goal is on gender (50-50 of men and women). In the No Info treatment, P2 is simply told they are the team leader without mention of the diversity goal. The main outcome measures include: (1) whether P2 chooses to correct P1’s or their own lowest-scoring throw, (2) whose replacement throw they select (P1’s or their own), and (3) how P2’s decisions vary across treatments and depending on P1’s gender and social class. This study aims to shed light on how awareness of diversity goals affects leaders' correction behaviors and decision-making processes in team settings."
