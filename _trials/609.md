abstract: "In an attempt to minimize new HIV infections among young girls, the Cameroon Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health worked with researchers to design a generalizable school-based HIV/AIDS education program targeted at 13-year-old teenage girls. This study evaluates this school-based HIV/AIDS education program, known as ISAS (Information, Teenage Sexuality and Health), on fertility, reproductive health, and high-risk sexual behavior of young girls in 8th grade. This experiment was specifically designed to test whether the type of HIV information messenger as well as the type of information being provided affect how much information is retained, how much information is transmitted to peers, and how reported behavior changes among girls and their friends."
