abstract: "This paper presents a pre-analysis plan for a randomized controlled experiment in which we provide mothers in an urban informal settlement of Nairobi, Kenya, access to subsidized and quality improved daycares. One thousand two hundred mothers are selected for our experiment in which one third receives free child care services for one year, a third receives free child care services in child care centers who will receive enhanced early child care and education training and materials and the remaining third will act as a control group. As half of mothers in this settlement, Korogocho, already utilize child care services, this intervention can have a measureable effect on the household allocation of resources and economic welfare. Our analysis will focus on the effects of this intervention on (a) changes in how the household allocates its income budget and changes in the household’s wealth position; (b) changes in how time is allocated within the household across child care, productive activities and human capital acquisition; and (c) on the mother’s occupational choice."
