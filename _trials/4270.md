abstract: "This project will be a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) aimed at studying the impact of worker heterogeneity on team production in a production plant in India. The plant employs over 900 workers. This study will experimentally vary exposure of workers to non-coreligionists, in order to study whether greater contact at the workplace can affect attitudes and in turn impact productivity. We will complement high frequency production data from the firm with a range of baseline and endline survey measures of out-group preferences and perceptions to answer this question."
