abstract: "The SMILES project is a IKEA Foundation funded graduation project, implemented in the Kyangwali Refugee Settlement in Kikuube District and in Kyaka II Refugee Settlement in Kyegegwa District (both in Western region of Uganda) as well as their host communities, that seeks to improve food and nutrition security among extremely poor households. AVSI Foundation is the main implementer of the intervention which comprises all components of the tested graduation approach with the innovation being that some of these components will be delivered through both the graduation approach and a Market-System Development (MSD) approach. Other members of the consortium are DAI, Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), Makerere University, Social Work and Social Administration Department (MAK) and Renewable Energy, Powering Agriculture and Rural Livelihoods Enhancement (REPARLE). The project implements a graduation approach integrated with a Markets System Development (MSD) approach to be delivered over a 24-month period with the objective of supporting extremely poor refugee and host communities towards increased self-reliance and resilience by addressing multiple dimensions of extreme poverty. The intervention components include: 1) coaching, 2) saving, 3) consumption support, 4) technical skills, 5) asset transfer, 6) business coaching, 7) referrals and 8) market linkages.
